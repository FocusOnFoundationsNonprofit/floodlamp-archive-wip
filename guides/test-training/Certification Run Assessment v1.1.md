summary_short: The “Test Training - Certification Run Assessment v1.1” is a pass/fail evaluation checklist for certifying test operators by reviewing a recorded run and logging any deviations with timestamps. It covers PPE/safety, contamination controls and infractions, prep and documentation, inactivation, reaction mix preparation, strip-tube amplification workflow, and app tube handling, with an optional module for plate-scale testing and electric dispenser use.

Date and Time:
PASS or FAIL

Safety
-   Proper PPE (Gloves, Lab Coat, N-95 Mask, and Goggles / Face Shield)

Contamination
-   Pen and sharpie labeled with green tape
-   Separation of Post-Amp area

Contamination Infractions
-   PPE lapse/removal
-   Use green labeled pen/marker with bare hands and not putting it to be cleaned afterwards
-   Use unmarked pen/marker with clean gloves (without cleaning gloves after or changing gloves)
-   Bare hands on anything improper, except in desk area
-   Reuse pipette tip improperly
-   Touch pipette tip to anything and then not discard it
-   Touch anything dirty then go back to work (face, mask, uncleaned phone, uncleaned laptop)

Prep
-   Turn on heaters, heat indicating light
-   Alcohol wipe the collection tubes

Documentation
-   Read each item then check it off after completing it
-   Writing legible

Inactivation
-   Write down on log sheet the amounts of saline and 100X prior to pipetting
-   Label 1XISS and logging the preparation correctly
-   Volumes correct for Saline and 100X IS
-   Mixing correct for 1XISS
-   Volume correct for 1XISS added to samples (1mL)
-   Sample tubes opened and closed properly
-   Vortex of samples correct
-   Timing correct for inactivation heating and cooling

Reaction Mix Prep (strip8 tubes)
-   Write down entry on log sheet prior to starting prep
-   Calc volumes correctly for PGS and CLAMP based on number of reactions
-   CLAMP and PGS thawed properly, so not to get too warm
-   Spin down reagents and reaction mix
-   Correct volumes for CLAMP and PGS
-   Get PGS and CLAMP source tubes back in freezer quickly
-   Vortex and spin down reaction mix tube
-   Marking the top tube in strip with 1,2,3, etc
-   Correct volume of reaction mix in each pcr tube (23uL)
-   Pipetting at the bottom of tubes
-   No blowout while dispensing reaction mix
-   Volume check strip tubes
-   Keep reactions covered strip tubes with rack lid to prevent dust

Amp Run (strip8 tubes)
-   Get Cold PCR Block out ~10min before adding tubes
-   Reaction mix tubes ready (thawed but not too warm (&lt;10 min)
-   Strip 8 tubes labeled on top tube of each strip
-   Tips setup properly to align with strips8 tubes to be used
-   Add negative control 1st
-   Using a lookup rack to keep continuity of sample order
-   Visually checking the 2uL in the tip from each inactivated sample
-   Amp pipetting technique correct - pipet up and down 5 times, blowout in liquid, tip touch
-   Well position correct and correspondence between tip, strip tube# and, where sample tube is put in lookup rack
-   Transfer strip to regular PCR block (so they aren’t cold going to Amp)
-   Only touching positive control (TPC) with one hand
-   Glove change after putting the positive control (TPC) back in freezer and before caps
-   Not touching the top of strip8 tubes or inside of a strip8 cap
-   Completely sealed strip tubes - check at eye level
-   Change gloves again after touching loading tubes/plate onto amp heater
-   Set main timer for 25min
-   Set phone timer for 24min
-   Put sample tubes in fridge during amp heating
-   Wait at least 1 minute after pulling off the amp heater
-   Take photo in lightbox
-   For photo apply crop and vivid filter
-   Logging amp run sheet properly with google form entry

App
-   Intake tubes correctly
-   Process and Result tubes correctly

**ONLY COMPLETE THIS LAST SECTION IF TRAINING FOR PLATE SCALE TESTING**

Dispenser Demonstration
-   Unpack an electric dispenser
-   Properly prime the dispenser
-   Dispense 1mL into tube without touching the tip

Amp Run (Abbreviated Plate)
-   Prepare reaction Mix following all previous guidelines
-   Pipette Reaction Mix into a reservoir
-   Use Multichannel Pipette to fill Column 1
-   Fully seal plate with foil seal
-   Pierce B1 to add negative control
-   Pierce C1 - H1 to add samples
-   Pierce A1 to add TPC, following all TPC guidelines
-   Glove change
-   Use a second foil seal on top of the first
-   Tight seal, no delamination
-   Put on Amp heater
-   Glove change
