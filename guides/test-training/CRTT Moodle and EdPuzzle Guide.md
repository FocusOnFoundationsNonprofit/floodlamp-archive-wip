## Purpose of this Guide
The guide is meant to collect all the foundational and fundamental information that FloodLAMP needs to finish the content creation and learning experience development process of their v1 training program.

## Moodle Account Login (Statistics, Billing, Tools)
This is the **GENERIC** Moodle Cloud Login page where you are logging in as a System Admin for any Moodle Cloud:
[https://moodlecloud.com/app/en/login](https://moodlecloud.com/app/en/login)
To log in as ADMIN on this page use:
Username: Floodlamp
Password: ​​LAMPlamp11!!

This is the **FLOODLAMP** Moodle Cloud Login Page where you are logging in as any FLOODLAMP user.
[https://floodlamp.moodlecloud.com/](https://floodlamp.moodlecloud.com/)
To log in as ADMIN on this page use the following, but **NOTE!** this is the SAME USER:
Username: Floodlamp
Password: ​​LAMPlamp11!!

## Video Demo for Admin Login

## EdPuzzle Teacher Login
User: floodlamplab@gmail.com
Pass: FFrT2)#y7=33\_7i

## Creating New Users in Moodle
-   100% self-enrollment - just send any new user sign up Moodle URL:
-   [https://floodlamp.moodlecloud.com/login/signup.php](https://floodlamp.moodlecloud.com/login/signup.php)
-   Walkthrough here: [https://www.loom.com/share/567a9f46dfc948ca8aa70a187c6d2b5e](https://www.loom.com/share/567a9f46dfc948ca8aa70a187c6d2b5e)

## Course Link to Covid Rapid Test Training (CRTT)

## User Tours can be Confusing
We’ve disabled the User Tours. When User Tours are used for a large and complex Moodle they might be very useful but in a simple, single course with self-enrollment, the User Tours confused some test users.
How to: [https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=380051](https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=380051)
Admin page: [https://floodlamp.moodlecloud.com/admin/tool/usertours/configure.php](https://floodlamp.moodlecloud.com/admin/tool/usertours/configure.php)

## Creating EdPuzzle Content
[https://www.loom.com/share/81c4c711f8bb42cf92a509401d4acba5](https://www.loom.com/share/81c4c711f8bb42cf92a509401d4acba5)
**NOTE!** Once EdPuzzle Content has been LINKED via this integration, if you move the video on Edpuzzle side, rename it, or put it in a new folder the integration won’t be able to find it. It will show a page like this instead: *“This assignment is currently inactive. Ask your teacher if you have any questions.”*

## EdPuzzle Work Around for Learners
JLX created directions right in the Moodle Course for the learners.
*It is very easy for them!* [https://floodlamp.moodlecloud.com/mod/page/view.php?id=101](https://floodlamp.moodlecloud.com/mod/page/view.php?id=101)

## Learner Recordings via Google Forms
[https://www.loom.com/share/fca35a9acf004bb9897f0d2579d3eb91](https://www.loom.com/share/fca35a9acf004bb9897f0d2579d3eb91)

## Self Assessment Options
Great forum post discussing Options:
[https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=394827](https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=394827)
*(TLDR; Quiz is likely the most efficient option)*

### JLX Trying Out a Moodle “Lesson”:
[https://www.loom.com/share/0bf0f4bb045248d581c98daa477e3b23](https://www.loom.com/share/0bf0f4bb045248d581c98daa477e3b23)

### JLX Showing Options for a Moodle “Quiz”:
[https://www.loom.com/share/a05617d516ee4fbf957b6037c36d4101](https://www.loom.com/share/a05617d516ee4fbf957b6037c36d4101)

## Activity Completion Settings
[How to Page](https://docs.moodle.org/310/en/Activity_completion_settings#:~:text=Default%20activity%20completion%20allows%20you,you%20can%20specify%20this%20here.)

1.  JLX set the current Course to a **Default** Activity Completion for **External Tools** (E.g. EdPuzzle) and **Pages.** This setting changes the default settings from Manual, meaning the student would have to Mark it Complete, to Automatic so that when they’ve viewed it, it shows as Done.
    a.  Be aware as you add any new content that the completion settings are not set to manual (Moodle will show this for manual: “Student can manually mark the activity as completed”)
    b.  Update new content to: “Show activity as complete when conditions are met” which will be followed by: “Student must view this activity to complete it”
2.  JLX already updated **all the current pages in the course** to these settings:
    a.  “Show activity as complete when conditions are met”
    b.  “Student must view this activity to complete it”

## Copying Courses in Moodle
[https://www.loom.com/share/f707fec983764f40a949abd3e588722d](https://www.loom.com/share/f707fec983764f40a949abd3e588722d)
**NOTE!** In addition to recreating EdPuzzle video links in the new course, you will ALSO have to create a NEW Google Form to keep the learner videos separated in different folders.

## Reporting: Learner Viewing Stats
### Stats on EdPuzzle Videos:
[https://www.loom.com/share/dec6ebac812a48858ce2dd0c36d80986](https://www.loom.com/share/dec6ebac812a48858ce2dd0c36d80986)

### Reporting for Quizzes, Lessons, etc.:
