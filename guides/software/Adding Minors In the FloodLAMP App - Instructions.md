summary_short: The “Instructions for Adding Minors In the FloodLAMP App” guide explains how an account holder signs consent in the FloodLAMP App, adds minors to their profile using the minor’s name and birth date, and completes minor consent. It also shows how linked minors appear under the household account in the Collection screen so they can be selected as participants when collecting sample tubes for testing.

Next, navigate to the profile screen, scroll to the bottom, and select the option to add minors to your profile. Enter the minor’s name and birth date into the fields that appear and hit “Sign Consent” to be prompted with the minor consent.

Repeat these steps to add each minor individually until all household minors are added. At this stage, you’re all set up to participate in the program\!

Once the minor(s) have been linked to your profile, you will be able to add them through the app each time you collect samples for testing. In the Collection screen, they will appear under the name of the account to which they were added. To find them, simply search for ***your name*** and their name will appear underneath yours in the search list.

Please follow these steps to include each minor as a Participant when collecting your sample tube(s) for testing.
