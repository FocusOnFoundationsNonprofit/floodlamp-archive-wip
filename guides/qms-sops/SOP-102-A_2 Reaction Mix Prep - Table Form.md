summary_short: The FloodLAMP QMS SOP-102-A_2 provides a table-form protocol and log for preparing Colorimetric LAMP reaction mix by combining PGS with NEB M1804 CLAMP master mix and dispensing 23 µL per well. It includes “put in use” fields, lot/expiration tracking, reaction mix ID labeling (RM_MMDD-1), and a preparation log capturing tube IDs, number of reactions, and calculated component volumes. The SOP sets reaction mix expiration at 4 weeks after preparation or sooner if discoloration occurs.

### Reaction Mix Prep
1\)  Thaw PGS and CLAMP MM
2\)  Vortex PGS and CLAMP MM for 3s, centrifuge/shake down
3\)  Add CLAMP MM to PGS tube (or new 1.5mL tube for custom amount)
4\)  Vortex for 10s and centrifuge/shake down
5\)  Add 23µL of reaction mix per well {at bottom, no blowout, no tip touch}
\* optional use reservoir and multichannel
6\)  Check volumes (look at pink liquid) by lifting plate or strip tubes out of rack
7\)  Label with Reaction Mix ID
8\)  EXPIRATION of Reaction Mix: 4 weeks after prep or if it becomes discolored.
