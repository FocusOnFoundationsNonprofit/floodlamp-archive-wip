summary_short: The FloodLAMP QMS SOP-103-A_1 is a run form for performing sample inactivation and LAMP amplification, including required PPE, heater setup checks, and step-by-step timing/temperature instructions for water bath or dry heat block inactivation and 65 °C amplification. It provides write-in fields for batch IDs, heater IDs, reagent IDs, control IDs, dispensing method, and run notes to support traceability in the linked site log. The form also includes lookup map tables for recording sample positions in strip tubes or plates.
