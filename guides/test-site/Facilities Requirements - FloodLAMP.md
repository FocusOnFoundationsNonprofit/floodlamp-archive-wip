## Introduction
FloodLAMP surveillance screening can be run using a variety of physical setups depending on the resources and space that are available and the volume of tests to be run. The following are lists of ***required*** aspects and ***preferred*** aspects of the test processing space (aka “lab”).

## Testing Space Requirements
-   Controlled access to testing space:
    -   While running assay
    -   Whenever certain testing equipment & materials are not stored / secured elsewhere
-   Large table (6’)
-   Space for dedicated mini-freezer
-   Available power sockets/power strip (standard 110V) for:
    -   Mini-freezer
    -   5 other plugs

## Preferred Testing Space Features
-   Dedicated room with access control (i.e., locks)
-   Non-carpeted floor
-   3 separate table (smooth plastic for easy cleaning)
-   Continuous wifi to enable remote freezer temperature monitoring
-   Space for dedicated mini-refrigerator
-   Power sockets/strip (standard 110V) additionally for:
    -   Mini-refrigerator
    -   Temperature monitoring hub
    -   Light box
