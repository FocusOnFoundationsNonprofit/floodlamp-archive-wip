summary_short: The Surveillance Program Results Communications Guidelines provides approved language for staff to communicate COVID surveillance screening outcomes without giving patient-specific diagnostic results, covering both pooled and non-pooled testing. It includes templates and talking points for notifying sponsors and organizations about positives or inconclusives and referring participants for follow-up diagnostic testing.

# Surveillance Program Results Communications Guidelines

**Note for staff:** *Because of the regulatory guidelines governing surveillance testing, we cannot give patient-specific diagnostic results. Please use the language in this document to guide your outgoing communications to participants and program administrators.*

## General Information on Reporting
### Non-pooled testing 
We do not provide diagnostic results (positive or negative) for our COVID surveillance screening program. Participants that test positive will be immediately contacted and referred for follow-up diagnostic testing. Participants that test negative will not be notified. When the surveillance testing session is completed, the status of your collected samples will be updated in the app to “Completed.” Your organization will receive a summary after each testing session.

### Pooled testing
We do not provide diagnostic results (positive or negative) for our COVID surveillance screening program. Participants in a pool that tests positive will be immediately contacted and referred for follow-up diagnostic testing. Participants in a pool that tests negative will not be notified. When the surveillance testing session is completed, the status of your collected sample pool will be updated in the app to “Completed.” Your organization will receive a summary after each testing session.

## Communicating Positives
*In general, we send a text to the sponsor and let them follow up with a phone call as they see fit. We then call the organization’s contact (i.e. the teacher/administrator in charge) and let them know about positives.*

### Text message to sponsor
Hi \[**name**\], this is \[**staff name**\] at \[**FloodLAMP or your organization**\]. I’m writing to let you know that we are referring you and your pool’s participants for follow-up diagnostic testing. Please call or text me if you have any questions. Thank you, \[**staff name**\]

## Communicating Inconclusives
*In cases where we can’t make a clear call, we send additional information to the sponsor and organization about the inconclusive. It’s generally easier to call the sponsor to explain*

### Talking points
-   The inconclusive could be caused by contamination of the sample or a weak positive
-   We are referring you and your pool’s participants for follow up diagnostic testing, usually a lab PCR test or an at-home antigen test. Please note that antigen tests are not as sensitive as FloodLAMP’s molecular test, and so [a negative antigen test does not preclude infection](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/safety-communications/home-covid-19-antigen-tests-take-steps-reduce-your-risk-false-negative-fda-safety-communication).
