summary_short: The “Drop Ship Initial Receiving Instructions” template is a checklist for confirming and documenting receipt of an initial lab shipment, including quantity verification, damage inspection, and reporting back to FloodLAMP support. It includes a fillable table of expected equipment and supplies (e.g., centrifuge, vortexers, sensors, water bath, light box, saline, freezer/fridge, safety equipment) with columns for received status, expected arrival date, and notes.

# Lab Setup - Initial Shipment
You should expect to receive the following equipment in the coming days.  Upon arrival, we request that you please:

* Verify receipt of these items in the quantities specified  
* Check items for any damages during shipment  
* Confirm receipt, quantities & condition to us at support@floodlamp.bio

Please do not unpack items beyond inspecting for damage during shipment - leave these items in their packaging until lab setup (because you will be cleaning them as you set up).
