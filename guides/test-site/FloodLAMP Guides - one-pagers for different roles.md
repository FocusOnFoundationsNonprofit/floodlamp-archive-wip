summary_short: The 'FloodLAMP Guides - one-pagers for different roles' compiles a few different documents: the FloodLAMP Mobile App Quick Start Guide, Guide for Sponsors, and Collection Guide for Participants. It explains how to set up the app, sign consent, and use it to run pooled sample collections by scanning tubes and adding participants. It helps sponsors and participants complete collections correctly and track sample status in the testing program.

# FloodLAMP Mobile App Quick Start Guide
## 1 Set your password
Set your password online by clicking the link emailed from system@appivo.com with the subject **"Welcome to testing with FloodLAMP."**

## 2 Download the app
Download the FloodLAMP app from either the Apple or Android app stores.

## 3 Sign in
Launch the app and sign in with your email and chosen password.

## 4 Sign the consent
The first time you launch the app, you will be prompted to sign the consent form. You cannot participate in the testing program without providing consent.

**All set!**
You are now ready to sponsor a collection and check the status of your collected samples.

# Guide for Sponsors
## 1 Launch FloodLAMP app
Tap the FloodLAMP app icon on your phone and log in with your account credentials. You should arrive at the homescreen, which will have 3 main buttons: **Collect**, **Return**, and **Status**.

## 2 Begin collection
Tap the **Collect** button and prepare a collection tube with clean hands. Make sure all pool participants follow the instructions in the **Collect your samples screen** and tap **Next** when completed.

\* Participants should add their own swab in the collection, being careful not to touch the flocked ends of the swabs or the tube.

## 3 Scan tube
Scan the tube on the **Scan** screen by tapping the **QR code button**. This will trigger your phone's camera for capture and automatically advance you to the next screen once you scan.

If you have camera problems, enter the code manually in the field below and tap **Next** when done.

## 4 Add participants
You may add up to 4 participants per tube. Tap the Add Participant field to trigger the search window. Tap the search bar to find the participant's name in the system. If you have a problem locating them in the system, type their name into the **Collection Note** field. Let your Site Coordinator or Admin know.

When you have finished adding all participants, tap **Complete Collection**.
You have successfully completed a pooled collection!

# Collection Guide for Participants
## 1 Coordinate with your pool sponsor
You will be pooling samples with up to 3 other people. One of these people will be the pool Sponsor, and they will use the FloodLAMP app to collect and record your pool's sample tube. Make sure you have coordinated with them on where and when to collect your samples.

Your Sponsor or program administrator should be able to help in case you have questions.

## 2 Collect your sample
   - **Sanitize** or wash your hands before you get started.
   - Your sponsor or site coordinator will provide you with a **collection swab**. Make sure not to touch the absorbent end.
   - **Swab your first nostril** in a circular motion, rotating 4 times and twisting the swab as you go.
   - **Swab the other nostril**, repeating the steps from the first side.
   - **Put swab in the collection tube**, if you swab is longer, break it at the break point and drop the swab end in swab first.
     (NOTE: green shaft 2" swabs have no break point)

**That's it!**

## 3 Bonus Points
**Watch the sponsor collect on the app**
   - learn how easy it is so you too can coordinate collections and be a sponsor.
