summary_short: The FloodLAMP School Program family flyer template explains how a school-based COVID-19 surveillance testing pilot works, including household pooling (up to 4 nasal swabs per tube), at-home self-collection, app registration/consent, and sample drop-off logistics. It provides plain-language guidance on participation, collection timing, kit replenishment, and what happens after testing (only positive pools are contacted), plus an FAQ and a reference copy of the non-diagnostic consent text.

Dear [School Name] Families,

FloodLAMP is pleased to provide a pilot program of COVID-19 surveillance testing for the [School Name] school and community. FloodLAMP's test supports family sample pooling with up to 4 nasal swabs per tube. This enables you to easily extend testing to other members of your household, including both children and adults. Self collection is done at home (or in the parking lot!), registered with the FloodLAMP Mobile App, and then samples are simply dropped off at the school. Please find additional details below and feel free to contact us with any questions by emailing [[covid support school email address]](mailto:[covid support school email address]).

## [School Name] Pilot Program
### Joining the program
-   Please review the consent below to understand the non-diagnostic nature of surveillance testing and how that works, namely that you do not directly receive test results. Participants in a pool that tests positive will be **immediately contacted** by school administrators for follow up diagnostic testing. Participants in a pool that tests negative **will not be notified**. In the app, you can check that status of your collected sample pools and see that the surveillance testing session has been completed.
-   Sign up for the program at [floodlamp.bio/register-family](https://floodlamp.bio/register-family/) to register everyone in your household who will participate. If you are signing up as an individual, please just fill in the information as the first Guardian. Passcode: SHALOM
-   After submitting the registration form, each registered adult Guardian or Household member will receive a welcome text or email from FloodLAMP Biotechnologies (you may need to check your spam folder). Follow the link in the email or text to set your password, then download the FloodLAMP Mobile App (for iOS or Android).
-   Please log into the app and you will be prompted to electronically sign the consent.
-   If you have children/minors who will be submitting samples, please add them to your profile (accessed by the icon in the upper right corner) and provide your consent. Minors need to be added in the app with the same information as on the registration form in order to be included in sample collections. You'll need to sign the consent for every minor added.

    ***\* Note***: *Only one adult in every household needs to add minors to their account profile. Every participating adult needs to install and log into the app to sign their consent form. If an adult in the household does not have a mobile device, please email us at support@floodlamp.bio for an alternative process.*

### The collection process
-   Collect samples by self-swabbing according to the instructions provided in your collection kit and in the app.
-   The samples are lower nasal swabs, not nasopharyngeal swabs (“brain pokes”).
-   If you are pooling samples, each person participating contributes a swab to the collection tube, up to 4.
-   For each pooled collection event, one registered adult in the family will supervise the collection and submit it through the FloodLAMP app. Please ***DO NOT FORGET TO COMPLETE THE COLLECTION STEP IN THE APP***. Doing so makes the operation run smoothly and reduces the burden on staff running the program.
-   If your child is resistant to their “nose tickle,” even with encouragement, we recommend not forcing it and trying again on the next collection day. We recommend continuing with the pooled collection with the rest of the household, which also provides security for the school and community.
-   Label each sample bag with the first and last name of one adult in the household.
-   Please return samples to TBS during morning drop off. If you can’t bring it then, or forget, please email [[covid support school email address]](mailto:[covid support school email address]) to make a special arrangement. For the current collection schedule, please check the "Returning Your Samples" page in the app, accessed by the menu in the upper left corner. We will communicate any changes with you via email.

### The test
-   Samples will be processed using the FloodLAMP QuickColorTM COVID-19 Test, a molecular RT-LAMP test (similar to PCR).
-   Testing is usually completed within 2 hours of the collection deadline.
-   If there is a positive family pool, the pool sponsor will be contacted for follow up diagnostic testing.
-   In the event no virus is detected in any of the samples, no one will be contacted.

## FloodLAMP FAQ 
### How long before the sample drop off time can I swab and collect?
It's preferable if you swab within a few hours of the sample dropoff time. Sample must be collected no more than 24 hours before the dropoff time.

### How do I get more collection kits?
Collection kits will be available to pick up every 3 weeks. If you need a new kit for some reason, please email [[covid support school email address]](mailto:[covid support school email address]) and a new kit will be sent home with your child.

### What if I have had COVID-19 symptoms or a known exposure?
Follow local public health guidelines and the advice from your medical provider. FloodLAMP surveillance testing is a tool to help communities identify individuals who do not expect that they have COVID-19. It is not a diagnostic medical test and participants should not rely on information received from FloodLAMP surveillance testing for decision making purposes. If you need help finding a PCR or rapid test, please contact [[covid support school email address]](mailto:[covid support school email address])

## FloodLAMP Voluntary Non-Diagnostic Surveillance Test Consent and Waiver
*For reference only, not for signature.*

I am the "Participant", and parent or legal guardian of each minor child identified on this form, also Participants. Each Participant on this Consent and Waiver understands and agrees to the following:
1.  I grant FloodLAMP Biotechnologies permission to perform a non-diagnostic molecular surveillance test (the "Test") of the Participant's sample to indicate the potential presence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
2.  I understand that I will not be given individual results from the Test. In the event the Participant's individual or pooled sample indicates the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, I will be referred to have the Participant take a diagnostic test.
3.  If referred to a diagnostic test, I agree to make a best effort at obtaining a diagnostic test for the Participant in a timely manner.
4.  I will not use the referral to a diagnostic test as a substitute for individual diagnostic testing.
5.  I agree not to rely on information received from FloodLAMP surveillance testing for decision making purposes.
6.  I agree not to misrepresent the purpose of this non-diagnostic surveillance Test.
7.  The Test is not being performed in a CLIA laboratory.
8.  The purpose of the Test is to improve public health and to determine appropriate mitigation measures for a population. The Test is not for individual medical or diagnostic purposes.
9.  I understand the Test does not rule out the possibility that the Participant may have been exposed to or is infected with SARS-CoV-2.
10. I understand that FloodLAMP Biotechnologies is not acting as the Participant's medical provider, and that the Test does not replace treatment by a medical provider. I agree that I will seek medical advice, care, and treatment from a medical provider for the Participant if I have questions or concerns.
11. The Participant's sample will be used for the sole, exclusive purpose of performing the Test. Results obtained will be used for the purpose of SARS-CoV-2 public health surveillance, as described herein.
12. I acknowledge and agree that FloodLAMP Biotechnologies may disclose Test results and associated information to appropriate county, state, or other governmental and regulatory entities as may be required or permitted by law.
13. I expressly waive and release FloodLAMP Biotechnologies and its employees and agents from any and all rights, claims, lawsuits or damages of any nature whatsoever arising directly or indirectly from my participation in the Test or testing program.
14. If at any time, I choose to revoke consent as provided here, said revocation must be received by FloodLAMP Biotechnologies in writing or by email at support@floodlamp.bio.
