summary_short: The Resulting Decision Chart v1.2 is a set of tabular rules for interpreting FloodLAMP test outcomes using single-triplicate and double-triplicate re-run workflows. It maps initial results and subsequent re-run replicate patterns (positive/negative/inconclusive) to a final reportable call—negative, positive, or inconclusive—so test-site staff can apply consistent decision logic across reruns.
