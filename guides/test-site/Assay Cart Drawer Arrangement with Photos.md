summary_short: The “Assay Cart Drawer Arrangement with Photos” guide lists the required contents for each of the four drawers in a FloodLAMP assay cart, with configurations for both “strips only” and “plates” setups. It standardizes how tubes, racks, saline/inactivation supplies, pipettes, tips, reservoirs, and plate supplies are organized so test-site staff can stock carts consistently and find materials quickly during runs.
