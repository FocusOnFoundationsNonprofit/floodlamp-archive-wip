## Section 4: First Aid Measures
**Eye Contact:**  
Check for and remove any contact lenses. In case of contact, immediately flush eyes with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes. Cold water may be used. Get medical attention.

**Skin Contact:**  
In case of contact, immediately flush skin with plenty of water. Cover the irritated skin with an emollient. Remove contaminated clothing and shoes. Cold water may be used. Wash clothing before reuse. Thoroughly clean shoes before reuse. Get medical attention.

**Serious Skin Contact:**  
Wash with a disinfectant soap and cover the contaminated skin with an anti-bacterial cream. Seek medical attention.

**Inhalation:**  
If inhaled, remove to fresh air. If not breathing, give artificial respiration. If breathing is difficult, give oxygen. Get medical attention if symptoms appear.

**Serious Inhalation:**  
Evacuate the victim to a safe area as soon as possible. Loosen tight clothing such as a collar, tie, belt or waistband. If breathing is difficult, administer oxygen. If the victim is not breathing, perform mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Seek medical attention.

**Ingestion:**  
Do NOT induce vomiting unless directed to do so by medical personnel. Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. Loosen tight clothing such as a collar, tie, belt or waistband. Get medical attention if symptoms appear.

**Serious Ingestion:** Not available.

## Section 5: Fire and Explosion Data
**Flammability of the Product:** Flammable.

**Auto-Ignition Temperature:** The lowest known value is 399°C (750.2°F) (Isopropyl alcohol).

**Flash Points:** CLOSED CUP: 18.3°C (64.9°F) - 24 deg. C (75 deg. F)

**Flammable Limits:** The greatest known range is LOWER: 2% UPPER: 12.7% (Isopropyl alcohol)

**Products of Combustion:** These products are carbon oxides (CO, CO2).

**Fire Hazards in Presence of Various Substances:**  
Highly flammable in presence of open flames and sparks, of heat. Flammable in presence of oxidizing materials. Non-flammable in presence of shocks.

**Explosion Hazards in Presence of Various Substances:**  
Slightly explosive in presence of open flames and sparks, of heat. Non-explosive in presence of shocks.

**Fire Fighting Media and Instructions:**  
Flammable liquid, soluble or dispersed in water. SMALL FIRE: Use DRY chemical powder. LARGE FIRE: Use alcohol foam, water spray or fog.

**Special Remarks on Fire Hazards:**  
Vapor may travel considerable distance to source of ignition and flash back. CAUTION: MAY BURN WITH NEAR INVISIBLE FLAME. Hydrogen peroxide sharply reduces the autoignition temperature of Isopropyl alcohol. After a delay, Isopropyl alcohol ignites on contact with dioxgenyl tetrafluorborate, chromium trioxide, and potassium tert-butoxide. When heated to decomposition it emits acrid smoke and fumes. (Isopropyl alcohol)

**Special Remarks on Explosion Hazards:**  
Secondary alcohols are readily autooxidized in contact with oxygen or air, forming ketones and hydrogen peroxide. It can become potentially explosive. It reacts with oxygen to form dangerously unstable peroxides which can concentrate and explode during distillation or evaporation. The presence of 2-butanone increases the reaction rate for peroxide formation. Explosive in the form of vapor when exposed to heat or flame. May form explosive mixtures with air. Isopropyl alcohol + phosgene forms isopropyl chloroformate and hydrogen chloride. In the presence of iron salts, thermal decompositon can occur, which in some cases can become explosive. A homogeneous mixture of concentrated peroxides + isopropyl alcohol are capable of detonation by shock or heat. Barium perchlorate + isopropyl alcohol gives the highly explosive alkyl perchlorates. It forms explosive mixtures with trinitormethane and hydrogen peroxide. It produces a violent explosive reaction when heated with aluminum isopropoxide + crotonaldehyde. Mixtures of isopropyl alcohol + nitroform are explosive.

## Section 6: Accidental Release Measures
**Small Spill:**  
Dilute with water and mop up, or absorb with an inert dry material and place in an appropriate waste disposal container.

**Large Spill:**  
Flammable liquid. Keep away from heat. Keep away from sources of ignition. Stop leak if without risk. Absorb with DRY earth, sand or other non-combustible material. Do not touch spilled material. Prevent entry into sewers, basements or confined areas; dike if needed. Be careful that the product is not present at a concentration level above TLV. Check TLV on the MSDS and with local authorities.

## Section 7: Handling and Storage
**Precautions:**  
Keep away from heat. Keep away from sources of ignition. Ground all equipment containing material. Do not ingest. Do not breathe gas/fumes/vapor/spray. Wear suitable protective clothing. In case of insufficient ventilation, wear suitable respiratory equipment. If ingested, seek medical advice immediately and show the container or the label. Avoid contact with skin and eyes. Keep away from incompatibles such as oxidizing agents, acids.

**Storage:**  
Store in a segregated and approved area. Keep container in a cool, well-ventilated area. Keep container tightly closed and sealed until ready for use. Avoid all possible sources of ignition (spark or flame).

## Section 8: Exposure Controls/Personal Protection
**Engineering Controls:**

**Personal Protection:**  
Safety glasses. Lab coat. Dust respirator. Be sure to use an approved/certified respirator or equivalent. Gloves (impervious).
