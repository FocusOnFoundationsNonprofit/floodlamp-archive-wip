summary_short: The Safety Data Sheet for EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, CAS 60-00-4) summarizes hazards, safe handling/storage, exposure controls, and emergency measures for laboratory use. It identifies inhalation (dust/mist) and eye irritation risks with potential respiratory effects from repeated exposure, and provides spill cleanup, fire response, and disposal guidance. The sheet also notes aquatic toxicity, transport as not regulated, and key regulatory/inventory listings and reportable quantity thresholds.
