summary_short: The Safety Data Sheet for TCEP (tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride, CAS 51805-45-9) provides hazard classification, first aid, storage, PPE, spill response, and disposal guidance for laboratory and synthesis use. It identifies the substance as strongly corrosive (causes severe skin burns and serious eye damage) and recommends strict protective equipment and locked, dry storage at 2–8 °C. The sheet also lists transport requirements as UN 3261, Class 8, Packing Group II (corrosive solid, acidic, organic, n.o.s.).
