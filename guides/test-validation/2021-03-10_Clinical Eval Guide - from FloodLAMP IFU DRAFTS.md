## Inactivation Solution Preparation
A 100X Inactivation Solution is prepared by mixing the components in the table below and vortexing for 30 seconds. Equivalent preparations utilizing components with different source concentrations may be used such that the final 100X Concentration is achieved. Aliquots of 100X Inactivation Solution should be stored in the dark at -20°C for up to 3 months. Upon thaw, working aliquots of 100X Inactivation Solution should be stored in the dark at room temperature for up to 1 month.

### 100X Inactivation Solution
| Component | Source Concentration | Volume (100 Samples) | Volume (2000 Samples) | 100X Concentration |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| TCEP | 0.5 M | 500 µL | 10 mL | 250 mM |
| EDTA | 0.5 M | 200 µL | 4 mL | 100 mM |
| NaOH | 10 N | 117 µL | 2.3 mL | 1.15 N |
| Nuclease-free Water |  | 183 µL | 3.7 mL |  |
| **TOTAL VOLUME** |  | **1000 µL** | **20 mL** |  |
||

## Sample Preparation (wet swabs)
\* For wet swab specimens (swabs in saline or unprocessed swab elution):
1.  If samples are frozen, thaw unless no ice crystals are present and then keep on ice, cold block or at 4°C.
2.  Pulse vortex each sample and briefly spin down in a centrifuge to collect the liquid at the bottom of the tube.
3.  Wipe the outside of the sample tube with 70% ethanol.

## Sample Inactivation
1.  Place the inactivation heater (a thermal cycler, water bath, dry heat bath or equivalent) in the BSC, turn on, and **set the temperature to hold at 100°C.**
2.  **Transfer 1 mL** or available volume of each sample to an appropriately labeled 1.5 mL or 5mL tube and securely cap.
3.  **Add 10μL per 1 mL sample volume of 100X Inactivation Solution, or 2μL per 0.1 mL sample volume of 50X Inactivation Solution** to each sample tube.
4.  **Vortex for 30 seconds**.
5.  Place sample tubes into the inactivation **heater for 8 minutes**.
6.  Remove sample tubes from the inactivation heater and let **cool at room temperature for 10 minutes**.
7.  Place sample tubes on ice, in the refrigerator, or on a cold block at **4°C until ready** to perform amplification reaction.
Note: Testing of inactivated specimens **must be conducted the same day** inactivation is performed. For long term storage, keep the original specimen at ≤-70°C.

## Preparing to Run Assay for the First Time
For PCR and Fluorimetric LAMP tests that use RT-PCR Instruments, complete this section of the corresponding IFU prior to continuing.

## Amplification Reaction Preparation
Common to all 3 assays:
1.  Place a 96-well PCR plate or PCR strip tubes onto a **cold block** or ice.
2.  **Thaw frozen reagents** until ice crystals are not present.
3.  Pulse vortex thawed reagents for 3 seconds and briefly spin down in a centrifuge to collect the liquid at the bottom of the tube.
4.  Store reagents on ice, in the refrigerator, or on a cold block at 4°C until ready to use.
5.  Prepare 96-well PCR plate or PCR strip tubes with amplification reaction mix

NOTE: For Colorimetric LAMP, optionally seal 96-well PCR plate with foil seal and add sample by piercing seal.

NOTE: Ensure that positive and negative controls are included in each batch run (i.e. in each PCR plate or group of strip tubes that are heated together).

NOTE: Colorimetric LAMP Negative Control must be prepared from 0.9% Saline and 100X Inactivation Solution.

### Controls

## Sample Addition
NOTE: Ensure that positive and negative controls are included in each batch run (i.e. in each PCR plate or group of strip tubes that are heated together).
1.  Add 2 uL of each sample into a separate tube in the amplification reaction PCR plate or strip tubes.
2.  Mix by pipetting.
3.  If using PCR plate optical seal (optionally using heat sealer). If using PCR strip tubes, cap strips.
4.  Pulse vortex and briefly spin down in a centrifuge to collect the liquid at the bottom of the tube.
