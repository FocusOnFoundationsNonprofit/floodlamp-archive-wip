FloodLAMP QuickColor(TM) COVID-19 Test  
For COVID-19 Emergency Use Authorization Only  
Instructions for Use

## Intended Use
FloodLAMP QuickColor(TM) COVID-19 Test is a reverse transcriptase loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay intended for the qualitative detection of RNA from SARS-CoV-2 in upper respiratory specimens including nasopharyngeal swabs, anterior nasal and mid-turbinate nasal swabs from individuals suspected of COVID-19 by their healthcare provider and from individuals without symptoms or other epidemiological reasons to suspect COVID-19 infection, when such individuals are tested as part of a testing program that includes testing at regular intervals, at least once per week, such as those implemented by schools, workplaces and community groups. Testing is limited to laboratories certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA), 42 U.S.C. §263a, to perform high complexity tests, or by similarly qualified non-U.S. laboratories. 

Results are for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA is generally detectable in upper respiratory specimens including nasopharyngeal swabs, anterior nasal and mid-turbinate nasal swabs during the acute phase of infection. Positive results are indicative of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA; clinical correlation with patient history and other diagnostic information is necessary to determine patient infection status. Positive results do not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease. Laboratories within the United States and its territories are required to report all test results to the appropriate public health authorities.

Negative results do not preclude SARS-CoV-2 infection and should not be used as the sole basis for patient management decisions. Negative results must be combined with clinical observations, patient history, and epidemiological information.

The FloodLAMP QuickColor(TM) COVID-19 Test is intended for use by qualified and trained clinical laboratory personnel specifically instructed and trained in the techniques of *in vitro* diagnostic procedures. The FloodLAMP QuickColor(TM) COVID-19 Test is only for use under the Food and Drug Administration’s Emergency Use Authorization.

## Principles of Procedure
The FloodLAMP QuickColor(TM) COVID-19 Test is a RNA extraction-free reverse transcriptase loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) molecular assay that indicates the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA with a simple visual color change. It can widely and rapidly be scale because 1) no special instrumentation of any kind is required, neither nucleic acid extraction equipment nor a RT-PCR instrument, 2) it utilizes reagents and supplies readily available in large quantities, and 3) is a straightforward protocol with minimal steps that can be executed quickly and reliably. It also utilizes the same streamlined sample preparation as the FloodLAMP EasyPCR(TM) Test. Both are supply chain robust, "open source" protocol tests, meaning designated laboratories may obtain the test components directly from vendors. Together, the two tests can be used in an integrated program for screening and rapid confirmation in large populations by a broad range of laboratories. 

The FloodLAMP QuickColor(TM) COVID-19 Test uses a set of specific primers that target ORF1ab, N and E genes for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. It uses Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP), a nucleic acid amplification technique wherein DNA amplification is carried out at a constant temperature of approximately 65°C. Samples are first treated with a TCEP-based Inactivation Solution followed by a heat inactivation step. The resulting inactivated sample is directly used as input in the LAMP reaction. The amplification reaction mix includes a reverse transcriptase (RT) polymerase to create complementary cDNA from RNA. The cDNA is subsequently amplified by a high strand displacement DNA polymerase. The amplified DNA products lower the pH of the reaction. A phenol red pH indicating dye is included in the amplification reaction mix, thus causing the reaction solution to visibly change from an initial bright pink to a bright yellow when sufficient amplification occurs. Reactions that change color to yellow indicate that SARS-CoV-2 RNA is present.

## Materials Provided and Storage
The FloodLAMP QuickColor(TM) COVID-19 Test utilizes standard chemicals available from multiple vendors, with the exception of the LAMP primers and Colorimetric LAMP master mix. Designated CLIA labs may order components directly from vendors.

## Materials Required but Not Provided
The FloodLAMP QuickColor(TM) COVID-19 Test is to be used with the reagents or equivalents listed in Table 1. No specialized instruments are needed. Only ordinary laboratory equipment such as pipettes, centrifuges, and heaters are needed.

### 10X LAMP Primer Mix Preparation
The FloodLAMP QuickColor(TM) COVID-19 Test uses 18 LAMP primers targeted for 3 different SARS-CoV-2 genes, with 6 primers for each target. Primer names and sequences are shown above in Table 2. All 18 primers are mixed together and input into a single amplification reaction. 

Primers may be purchased from the vendor LGC Biosearch Technologies as 3 pre-blended sets, or the primers may be purchased as 18 individual custom oligos. Table 6 below lists the primer products to be ordered.   
   
The LGC Biosearch primer products are provided already blended for each target (6 primers per tube) and dried such that upon resuspension with 1 mL of nuclease-free water, the primers for each target are at 30X concentration. One resuspended tube for each of the 3 targets (i.e. primer blends) are mixed together to yield a 3 mL total volume that contains all individual primers at 10X concentration. This 3 mL of 10X LAMP Primer Mix provides for 1,200 reactions at 2.5 µL per reaction.  
   
Alternatively to the pre-blended LGC Biosearch products, primers may be purchased as individual custom oligos. Custom oligos may be blended to form 30X Primer Set Mixes as intermediates or all mixed together for the 10X LAMP Primer Mix. The FIP and BIP primers for each target require purification by HPLC or an equivalent process. Appropriate validation of primer mixes from custom oligos is required. Primers may be stored at 4°C for up to one month, or at \-20°C for up to 1 year.

### Sample Preparation
\* For wet swab specimens (swabs in saline or unprocessed swab elution): 

1) If samples are frozen, thaw unless no ice crystals are present and then keep on ice, cold block or at 4°C.   
2) Pulse vortex each sample and briefly spin down in a centrifuge to collect the liquid at the bottom of the tube.   
3) Wipe the outside of the sample tube with 70% ethanol. 

For dry swab specimens:

1) Wipe the outside of the sample tube with 70% ethanol. 

### Sample Inactivation
1) Place the inactivation heater (a thermal cycler, water bath, dry heat bath or equivalent) in the BSC, turn on, and set the temperature to hold at 100 °C.  
2) \* For wet swab specimens: transfer 1 mL or available volume of each sample to an appropriately labeled 1.5 mL or 5mL tube and securely cap.   
3) \* For wet swab specimens: add 10μL per 1 mL sample volume of 100X Inactivation Solution to each sample tube.  
4) For dry swab specimens (DO NOT DO FOR WET SWAB SPECIMENS): add 1 mL of 1X Inactivation Solution to each sample tube.  
5) Vortex for 30 seconds.  
6) Place sample tubes into the inactivation heater for 8 minutes.  
7) Remove sample tubes from the inactivation heater and let cool at room temperature for 10 minutes.  
8) Place sample tubes on ice, in the refrigerator, or on a cold block at 4°C until ready to perform amplification reaction. 

Note: Testing of inactivated specimens must be conducted the same day inactivation is performed. For long term storage, keep the original specimen at ≤-70°C. 

### Colorimetric LAMP Amplification Reaction Preparation
1) Place a 96-well PCR plate or PCR strip tubes onto a cold block or ice.  
2) Thaw frozen reagents until ice crystals are not present.   
3) Pulse vortex thawed reagents and briefly spin down in a centrifuge.   
4) Store on ice, in the refrigerator, or on a cold block at 4°C until ready to use.  
5) Combine components of Primer-Guanidine Solution per volumes listed in Table 7, or proportionally scaled for the number of reactions to be run. 

      NOTE: Component volumes should be scaled proportionally for the number of reactions.   
      NOTE: The Primer-Guanidine Solution may be prepared in advance and stored at \-20°C    
      for up to 1 month.

6) Pulse vortex and briefly spin down in a centrifuge.   
7) Prepare the Colorimetric LAMP Amplification Reaction Mix by adding the Colorimetric LAMP MM to the Primer-Guanidine Solution per the volumes listed in Table 8.   
8) Vortex the Colorimetric LAMP Amplification Reaction Solution for 10 seconds and briefly spin down in a centrifuge to collect the liquid at the bottom of the tube.  
9) Add 23 µL of the Colorimetric LAMP Amplification Reaction Solution into the wells of the PCR plate or PCR strip tubes.

   NOTE: Reaction plates/strip tubes comprising the Colorimetric LAMP Amplification Reaction Solution may be prepared in advance, capped/sealed, and stored at \-20°C for up to 3 days prior to addition of the sample. A heated plate sealer may be used to seal plates. Alternatively, a manually applied foil or optical seal may be used.

### Sample Addition and Heating
NOTE: Ensure that positive and negative controls are included in each batch run (i.e. in each PCR plate or group of strip tubes that are heated together).

1) Turn on the amplification heater (a thermal cycler, water bath, dry heat bath or equivalent) and set the temperature to hold at 65°C.

   NOTE: Amplification heater should be located in a separate, dedicated BSC or area of the lab. Proper cross contamination prevention practices are required, such as glove changes, to prevent amplicon contamination.

2) Add 2 μL of each sample into a separate tube in the amplification reaction PCR plate or strip tubes.   
3) Mix by pipetting.  
4) If using PCR plate, seal with foil seal, optical seal (optionally using heat sealer). If using PCR strip tubes, cap strips.  
5) Pulse vortex and briefly spin down in a centrifuge to collect the liquid at the bottom of the tube.  
6) Place the plate or strip tubes in the heater and set timer for 25 minutes (do not use heated lid).  
7) Remove the plate or strip tubes from the heater after 25 minutes.  
8) Let cool for 1 minute and then interpret the test results.

### Test Controls
All test controls should be examined prior to interpretation of patient specimen results. If the controls are not valid and the expected result, the specimen results cannot be interpreted. An example of the expected appearance of the negative and positive controls after amplification is shown in Figure 1.

**![][image1]![][image2]**

#### Figure 1: Negative control (left) and positive control (right) after amplification.
If the negative and positive controls do not appear as expected, the specimen results of the corresponding plate or batch should be considered invalid. In the event of a failure of either the positive or negative control, the lab should discard some or all of the consumables utilized for associated run, including the filter tips, tubes, plates, seals, and aliquots of reagents. Additionally, all pipettes, BSC, and appropriate lab surfaces should be thoroughly cleaned with freshly made 10% bleach solution, 70% ethanol, and optionally RNAseZAP product. In the event of the failure of the positive control, the working aliquot of positive control material should be discarded. Additionally, the lab should review the expiration of the batch of positive control aliquots and verify their integrity by performing qualification reactions of one or more positive control aliquots. If controls continue to fail, labs should not perform additional tests on clinical specimens or report results. Invalid test results should be repeated by performing another amplification reaction.

### Patient Specimen Results Interpretation
NOTE: Patient specimen results can only be interpreted if the positive and negative controls in the plate or group of strip tubes have the expected results.

Test results should be read at least 1 minute and no more than 8 hours after plates or tubes have been removed from heat. Test results may be determined directly from visual inspection of the color of the reaction tubes: 

* yellow \- result is positive  
* bright pink or red \- result is negative  
* any other color \- result is invalid. 

Examples are shown below in Figure 2. Edge cases for positive and negative results are shown below in Figure 3. Any color variance stronger than the edge cases should be interpreted as inconclusive. In order to reduce the chance of both false negative and false positive results, this window for color variance is intentionally set to be small.

If the initial test is inconclusive, then one of the following should be performed:  
1) repeat the Colorimetric LAMP Amplification Reaction on the inactivated sample. If the repeat test has a positive result then the final interpretation of the test is positive. If the repeat test has a negative or another inconclusive result, then the final interpretation is inconclusive.  
2) follow-up test the inactivated sample with the FloodLAMP EasyPCR(TM) COVID-19 Test or another high sensitivity EUA authorized test that comprises the same inactivation protocol. The final interpretation is the result of the follow-up test.

For serial screening of individuals without symptoms or other epidemiological reasons to suspect COVID-19 infection, the initial inconclusive test result may be considered the final interpretation.

If the final interpretation of the test result is inconclusive, then "Inconclusive" should be reported and retesting of the individual is recommended.

## Performance Evaluation
### Analytical Sensitivity: Limit of Detection (LoD)
The Limit of Detection (LoD) for the FloodLAMP QuickColor(TM) COVID-19 Test was established using gamma-irradiated SARS-CoV-2 virus cell lysate (BEI NR-52287) spiked into negative real specimens. The negative specimens were confirmed by PCR using the CDC primers. The gamma-irradiated virus was spiked into the specimen prior to the heat inactivation step, and carried through the entire assay. The concentration of spike was such that the contrived positive sample was at 100,000 copies/mL after the inactivation step. The stock contrived positive was diluted into inactivated negative sample matrix to produce the concentrations for the LoD study. A preliminary LoD run was performed using the concentrations ranging from 100,000 copies/mL to 3,100 copies/mL. Concentrations of 12,500 and 6,250 were selected for confirmatory LoD runs. LoD run details are provided in Supporting Data, with the results summarized below in Table 9. The LoD, defined as the concentration at which at least 95% of the samples are positive, was determined at 12,500 copies/mL.

#### Table 9: LoD Confirmatory Data Results
| Concentration of Contrived Positive Sample  | Replicates Detected |
| :---: | :---: |
| 12,500 copies/mL | 95% (20/21) |
| 6,250 copies/mL | 52% (11/21) |

### Analytical Sensitivity: Inclusivity (*in silico*)
An inclusivity study was conducted for the ORF1ab, N2, and E1 primer sets against all complete, high coverage SARS-CoV-2 sequences deposited at GISAID as of February 27, 2021. Table 10 summarizes the results of this *in silico* inclusivity analysis. A total of 498,224 sequences were considered. There are 10 sequence isolates that have 1mm to both As1e and E1 and had N2 excluded due to greater than 15 N's, with the other 498,214 sequence isolates all have at least 1 target region that is a complete match.

Each primer set matched at 100% similarity against the SARS-CoV-2 RefSeq reference genome (Wuhan-Hu-1; NC\_045512.1). All three primer sets differed by one or fewer mutations for 99.7% of GISAID sequences, indicating nominal primer hybridization for all SARS-CoV-2 variants under consideration.	

#### Table 10: *In Silico* Inclusivity Analysis for LAMP Primers
| Primer | AS1e  (ORF1ab gene) |  | N2  (N gene) |  | E1  (E gene) |  |

### Evaluation of Impact of Viral Mutations
The As1e, E1 and N2 primer regions of all SARS-CoV-2 genomes present in GISAID as of 2/26/2021 were evaluated to assess the potential impact of genomic variants on LAMP primer binding. This analysis was performed with the Primer Monitoring Tool from New England Biolabs ([primer-monitor.neb.com](http://primer-monitor.neb.com)), which continually monitors registered primer sets for overlapping variants in sequences from GISAID. Results are summarized by region and locus below in Table 11, including the 30 countries with most sequences in GISAID. Sequences were aligned to the SARS-CoV-2 reference sequence (NC\_045512.2) using minimap2 (minimap2 \-t 16 \-x asm5 \-a). Variant sites (excluding Ns) were identified using samtools mpileup and summarized by region and genome position. Genomic positions having \>= 40 global variant observations are shown (column labels). When present, box labels indicate the fraction of variants observed at a given locus.

The aggregate of current published mutations is not expected to reduce performance of the FloodLAMP QuickColor(TM) COVID-19 Test by more than 5% from that established by the performance evaluation in this EUA submission. Further, the use of 3 primer sets targeting different regions in the SARS-CoV-2 genome should make the test robust to new genetic variants.

#### Table 11: Variant Analysis of LAMP Primers

### Analytical Specificity: Cross-Reactivity (*in silico*)
*In silico* cross-reactivity analysis was performed by aligning the primer sequences of the FloodLAMP QuickColor(TM) COVID-19 Test against sequences of other coronaviruses and common respiratory flora using the BLASTn alignment tool from NCBI. Results of this analysis are presented in Tables 12A, 12B, and 12C. 

The % identity range (\# identical bases/ \# primer bases) is shown for each primer and organism. Darker font indicates % identity greater than 80%. Organisms with \>= 50% identity primer hits are shown. This analysis is not intended to predict amplification. Near perfect homology across B3, F3, FIP and BIP is necessary to support successful amplification. With the exception of SARS-CoV, simultaneous homologies do not occur between any of the primers and microorganisms screened. With respect to clinical relevance of the *in silico* cross-reactivity analysis, there are no known circulating strains of SARS-CoV circulating in humans, thus the overall probability for the test to produce a cross-reactive signal is negligible.

### Analytical Specificity: Cross-Reactivity (*wet testing*)
Wet testing was performed to demonstrate that the FloodLAMP QuickColor(TM) COVID-19 Test does not react with related pathogens, high prevalence disease agents and normal or pathogenic flora that are reasonably likely to be encountered in a clinical specimen.  SARS-CoV, RSV, Flu, Human Metapneumovirus. and Streptococcus Salivarius were tested for potential cross-reactivity, as shown in Table 13. Gamma-irradiated SARS-CoV-2 virus cell lysate (BEI NR-52287) was spiked onto dried AN swab specimens to produce contrived Positve Controls. Negative Control dried swabs obtained simultaneously were confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2 negative by PCR using the CDC primers. The gamma-irradiated SARS-CoV-2 virus and cross-reactivity organisms were spiked into the dried swabs prior to the heat inactivation step, and carried through the full test protocol. 

All wet testing showed no cross-reactivity with the viral pathogens and common respiratory flora, as shown in Table 13.

#### Table 13: Wet Testing Cross-Reactivity Results
| Organism | Description | BEI Number | Detected Replicates |
| ----- | ----- | :---: | :---: |
| SARS-CoV | UV-inactivated virus | NR-3882 | 0/3 |
| Human Metapneumovirus | Genomic RNA | NR-49122 | 0/3 |
| RSV | Genomic RNA | NR-43976 | 0/3 |
| Influenza B | Genomic RNA | NR-45848 | 0/3 |
| Streptococcus salivarius | Bacterial cell culture | HM-121 | 0/3 |

### Analytical Specificity: Interfering Substances
Exogenous and endogenous substances were tested for potential interference with the FloodLAMP QuickColor(TM) COVID-19 Test. Gamma-irradiated SARS-CoV-2 virus cell lysate (BEI NR-52287) was spiked onto dried AN swab specimens to produce contrived Positve Controls. Negative Control dried swabs obtained simultaneously were confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2 negative by PCR using the CDC primers. The gamma-irradiated SARS-CoV-2 virus and interfering substances were spiked into the dried swabs prior to the heat inactivation step, and carried through the full test protocol. 

All interfering substance testing showed no disagreement with expected positive and negative results, as shown in Table 14 and Supporting Data.

#### Table 14: Interfering Substances Results
| Interfering Substance | Active Ingredient | Concentration | % Agreement with Expected Results |  |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
|  |  |  | **Positive Control Spiked** | **Negative Control Unspiked** |
| Blood | N/A | 1% v/v | 100% (3/3) | 100% (3/3) |
| Nasal Congestion Spray | Acetaminophen, Guaifenesin, Phenylephrine HCI | 20% v/v | 100% (3/3) | 100% (3/3) |

## Clinical Evaluation
The clinical evaluation of the FloodLAMP QuickColor(TM) COVID-19 Test utilized confirmed clinical anterior nares swab specimens. 40 positive and 40 negative clinical specimens were evaluated and compared to a high sensitivity EUA authorized test run on the original fresh samples. The FloodLAMP QuickColor(TM) COVID-19 Test showed a positive agreement of 90% and a negative agreement of 100%. The 4 false negative results were specimens with high Ct values as previously measured by the comparator test, indicating low viral load. A summary of the clinical performance is below in Table 15. 

#### Table 15: Clinical Evaluation Results
| FloodLAMP QuickColor(TM) COVID-19 Test Results | Comparator \- High Sensitivity EUA Authorized Test |  |  |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
|  | **Positive** | **Negative** | **Total** |
| Positive | 36 | 0 | 36 |
| Negative | 4 | 40 | 44 |
| Total | 40 | 40 | 80 |
| Positive Agreement | 90.0% (36/40) 95% CI: 76.3% to 97.2% |  |  |
