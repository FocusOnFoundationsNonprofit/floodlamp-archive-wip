FloodLAMP EasyPCR(TM) COVID-19 Test  
For COVID-19 Emergency Use Authorization Only  
Instructions for Use

## Intended Use
FloodLAMP EasyPCR(TM) COVID-19 Test is a real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay intended for the qualitative detection of RNA from SARS-CoV-2 in upper respiratory specimens including nasopharyngeal swabs, anterior nasal and mid-turbinate nasal swabs from individuals suspected of COVID-19 by their healthcare provider and from individuals without symptoms or other epidemiological reasons to suspect COVID-19 infection, when such individuals are tested as part of a testing program that includes testing at regular intervals, at least once per week, such as those implemented by schools, workplaces and community groups. Testing is limited to laboratories certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA), 42 U.S.C. §263a, to perform high complexity tests, or by similarly qualified non-U.S. laboratories. 

Results are for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA is generally detectable in upper respiratory specimens including nasopharyngeal swabs, anterior nasal and mid-turbinate nasal swabs during the acute phase of infection. Positive results are indicative of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA; clinical correlation with patient history and other diagnostic information is necessary to determine patient infection status. Positive results do not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease. Laboratories within the United States and its territories are required to report all test results to the appropriate public health authorities.

Negative results do not preclude SARS-CoV-2 infection and should not be used as the sole basis for patient management decisions. Negative results must be combined with clinical observations, patient history, and epidemiological information.

The FloodLAMP EasyPCR(TM) COVID-19 Test is intended for use by qualified and trained clinical laboratory personnel specifically instructed and trained in the techniques of *in vitro* diagnostic procedures. The FloodLAMP EasyPCR(TM) COVID-19 Test is only for use under the Food and Drug Administration’s Emergency Use Authorization.

## Principles of Procedure
The FloodLAMP EasyPCR(TM) COVID-19 Test is a RNA extraction-free, duplexed RT-qPCR assay which indicates whether SARS-CoV-2 RNA is present. It can widely and rapidly be scaled because 1) it does not require nucleic acid extraction equipment, 2) it utilizes reagents and supplies readily available in large quantities, and 3) it is a straightforward protocol with minimal steps that can be executed quickly and reliably. It also utilizes the same streamlined sample preparation as the FloodLAMP QuickColor(TM) COVID-19 Test. Both are supply chain robust, "open source" protocol tests, meaning designated laboratories may obtain the test components directly from vendors. Further, the FloodLAMP QuickColor(TM) COVID-19 Test is isothermal, does not require any instrumentation and has a visual readout. Together, the two tests can be used in an integrated program for screening and rapid confirmation in large populations by a broad range of laboratories. 

In the FloodLAMP EasyPCR(TM) COVID-19 Test, samples are first treated with a TCEP-based Inactivation Solution followed by a heat inactivation step, and the resulting inactivated sample is directly used as input in the duplexed RT-qPCR test. The test does not use new primers and probes for RT-qPCR testing, but rather uses previously validated primer and probe sets (2019-nCoV\_N1 and RP) developed by the US CDC, which are readily available from multiple commercial suppliers. The human Ribonuclease P (RP) probe was modified with a different fluorophore so that the primer/probe set could be combined in a duplex assay, reducing the number of tests to 1 assay with 2 sets.

## Materials Provided and Storage
The FloodLAMP EasyPCR(TM) COVID-19 Test utilizes standard chemicals available from multiple vendors, with the exception of the PCR Kit. Designated CLIA labs may order components directly from vendors.

## Materials Required but Not Provided
The FloodLAMP EasyPCR(TM) COVID-19 Test is to be used with the reagents or equivalents listed in Table 1. The FloodLAMP EasyPCR(TM) COVID-19 Test is to be used with RT-PCR Instruments such as Applied Biosystems Quantstudio(TM) Systems and Bio-Rad CFX(TM) Systems.

### Controls Preparation
One **Positive Template Control and one Negative (No Template) Control** will be included on every 96-well plate with up to 94 samples, or with every batch of strip tubes. An **Internal Process Control** is included in every PCR reaction. 

1) A **“No Template” (Negative) Control (NTC)** is needed to assure the absence of cross-contamination from positive samples, positive controls, or amplicons and is used to determine if sample results are valid. It consists of nuclease-free water.  
     
2) A **Positive Template Control** is needed to assure proper functioning of reagents and the absence of significant RNAse contamination. It consists of synthetic viral RNA at a concentration of approximately 100,000 cp/mL diluted in total human RNA and nuclease-free water. Stock and working aliquots of the positive control are produced from the sources listed in Table 5 or equivalents. Working aliquots should be diluted prior to use to 100,000 cp/mL. Positive control aliquots should be stored for at most 3 months at \-80°C, or at most 1 month at \-20°C.    
     
3) An **Internal Process Control** is needed to assure sufficient specimen quantity and quality. It consists of a primer/probe set targeting the human RNaseP gene that is included in a single PCR amplification reaction. The RNAseP Internal Process Control uses a fluorescent reporter in a separate channel from the SARS-CoV-2 channel (i.e. in duplex).

### Sample Preparation
\* For wet swab specimens (swabs in saline or unprocessed swab elution): 

1) If samples are frozen, thaw unless no ice crystals are present and then keep on ice, cold block or at 4°C.   
2) Pulse vortex each sample and briefly spin down in a centrifuge to collect the liquid at the bottom of the tube.   
3) Wipe the outside of the sample tube with 70% ethanol. 

For dry swab specimens:
1) Wipe the outside of the sample tube with 70% ethanol. 

### Sample Inactivation
1) Place the inactivation heater (a thermal cycler, water bath, dry heat bath or equivalent) in the BSC, turn on, and set the temperature to hold at 100°C.  
2) \* For wet swab specimens: transfer 1 mL or available volume of each sample to an appropriately labeled 1.5 mL or 5mL tube and securely cap.   
3) \* For wet swab specimens: add 10µL per 1 mL sample volume of 100X Inactivation Solution to each sample tube.  
4) For dry swab specimens (DO NOT DO FOR WET SWAB SPECIMENS): add 1 mL of 1X Inactivation Solution to each sample tube.  
5) Vortex for 30 seconds.  
6) Place sample tubes into the inactivation heater for 8 minutes.  
7) Remove sample tubes from the inactivation heater and let cool at room temperature for 10 minutes.  
8) Place sample tubes on ice, in the refrigerator, or on a cold block at 4°C until ready to perform amplification reaction. 

Note: Testing of inactivated specimens must be conducted the same day inactivation is performed. For long term storage, keep the original specimen at ≤-70°C.

#### Compiling Results Option 2: Sample Name Input
For this option, sample names (i.e. specimen IDs) are directly input into the instrument software prior to starting the run.  Open the results file and continue to “Analyzing Data” section to score results.

### Results Interpretation
#### Test Controls
All test controls should be examined prior to interpretation of patient specimen results. If the controls are not valid and the expected result, the specimen results cannot be interpreted. Target results for the controls will be interpreted according to Table 5 below.

1) The “No Template” (Negative) Control (NTC) should yield a negative “not detected” result for both the N1 and RNaseP targets.  
     
2) The Positive Template Control should yield a positive “detected” result for the N1 target and a negative “not detected” for the RNaseP control.  
     
3) The Internal Process Control should yield a positive "detected" result for RNaseP. Detection of RNaseP is required to report a negative SARS-CoV-2 result. 

If the negative and positive controls do not appear as expected, the specimen results of the corresponding plate or batch should be considered invalid. In the event of a failure of either the positive or negative control, the lab should discard some or all of the consumables utilized for associated run, including the filter tips, tubes, plates, seals, and aliquots of reagents. Additionally, all pipettes, BSC, and appropriate lab surfaces should be thoroughly cleaned with freshly made 10% bleach solution, 70% ethanol, and (optionally) RNAseZAP(TM) product. In the event of the failure of the positive control, the working aliquot of positive control material should be discarded. Additionally, the lab should review the expiration of the batch of positive control aliquots and verify their integrity by performing qualification reactions of one or more positive control aliquots. If controls continue to fail, labs should not perform additional tests on clinical specimens or report results. Invalid test results should be repeated by performing another amplification reaction.

#### Patient Specimen Results Interpretation
NOTE: Patient specimen results can only be interpreted if the positive and negative controls in the plate or group of strip tubes have the expected results.

Use Table 11 below to assign a result to each sample.  

#### Table 11: Interpretation of Assay Results
| ABI QuantStudio(TM) 7 Pro |  |  |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Result** | **Ct Value: N1** | **Ct Value RP** |
| Positive | \<38.0 | Any Value |
| Negative | ≥38.0 | \<35.0 |
| \*Invalid | ≥38.0 | ≥35.0 |
| **Bio-Rad CFX96 Touch(TM) ABI QuantStudio(TM) 6 Flex** |  |  |
| **Result** | **Ct Value: N1** | **Ct Value RP** |
| Positive | \<40.0 | Any Value |
| Negative | ≥40.0 | \<35.0 |
| \*Invalid | ≥40.0 | ≥35.0 |
||

\*Invalid test results should be repeated by rerunning the primary sample if available, otherwise the inactivated sample. Results from retested samples will follow the same interpretation as listed in Table 11.

If the final interpretation of the test result is invalid, then "Invalid/Inconclusive" should be reported and retesting of the individual is recommended. 

## Performance Evaluation
### Analytical Sensitivity: Limit of Detection (LoD)
The Limit of Detection (LoD) for the FloodLAMP EasyPCR(TM) COVID-19 Test was established using gamma-irradiated SARS-CoV-2 virus cell lysate (BEI NR-52287) spiked into negative real specimens. The gamma-irradiated virus was spiked into the specimen prior to the heat inactivation step, and carried through the entire assay. The concentration of spike was such that the contrived positive sample was at 100,000 copies/mL after the inactivation step. The stock contrived positive was diluted into inactivated negative sample matrix to produce the concentrations for the LoD study. A preliminary LoD run was performed using the concentrations ranging from 100,000 copies/mL to 3,100 copies/mL. Concentrations of 6,300, 3,100 and 1,600 copies/mL were selected for confirmatory LoD runs. LoD run details are provided in Supporting Data, with the results summarized below in Table 12. The LoD, defined as the concentration at which at least 95% of the samples are positive, was determined at 3,100 copies/mL.

#### Table 12: Confirmatory LoD Data Results
| Instrument | LoD | Positive Replicates |
| ----- | :---: | :---: |
| ABI QuantStudio(TM) 7 Pro | 3,100 copies/mL | 95% (20/21) |
| ABI QuantStudio(TM) 6 Flex | 3,100 copies/mL | 100% (21/21) |
| Bio-Rad CFX96 Touch(TM) | 3,100 copies/mL | 95% (20/21) |

### Analytical Sensitivity: Inclusivity
FloodLAMP EasyPCR(TM) COVID-19 Test includes a modified RT-qPCR assay by duplexing the previously authorized CDC N1 and human RNase P primer-probe sets. Inclusivity was tested in the original US CDC EUA with all publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes as of 1 February 2020. The initial analysis showed 100% homology between the N1 primer-probe set and available genomes, except for one low frequency mismatch with the N1 forward primer. However, this was not expected to affect performance of the primer-probe set due to annealing temperatures of 55°C which tolerate 1-2 mismatches. Indeed, performance of the N1 primer-probe set was shown to be high in the previous comparison of primer-probes sets ([https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-0761-6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-0761-6)). GISAID continuously evaluates mismatches between newly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes and primer-probe sets and confirms a low frequency of nucleotide mismatches (\<5%) with the N1 primer-probe set.

### Analytical Specificity: Cross-Reactivity
The primer and probe sets used in FloodLAMP’s duplex assay were developed by the US CDC and have been EUA certified. The CDC reported no cross-reactivity with other human coronaviruses (229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1), MERS-coronavirus, SARS-coronavirus, and 14 additional human respiratory viruses (see [https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download](https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download)). 

### Analytical Specificity: Interfering Substances
Exogenous and endogenous substances were tested for potential interference with the FloodLAMP EasyPCR(TM) COVID-19 Test. Gamma-irradiated SARS-CoV-2 virus cell lysate (BEI NR-52287) was spiked onto dried AN swab specimens to produce contrived Positve Controls. Negative Control dried swabs obtained simultaneously were confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2 negative by PCR using the CDC primers. The gamma-irradiated SARS-CoV-2 virus and interfering substances were spiked into the dried swabs prior to the heat inactivation step, and carried through the full test protocol. 

All interfering substance testing showed no disagreement with expected positive and negative results, as shown in Table 13.

#### Table 13: Interfering Substances Results
| Interfering Substance | Active Ingredient | Concentration | % Agreement with Expected Results |  |

## Clinical Evaluation
The clinical evaluation of the FloodLAMP EasyPCR(TM) COVID-19 Test utilized confirmed clinical anterior nares swab specimens. 40 positive and 40 negative clinical specimens were evaluated and compared to a high sensitivity EUA authorized test run on the original fresh samples. The FloodLAMP EasyPCR(TM) COVID-19 Test showed a positive agreement of 97.5% and a negative agreement of 100%. The single false negative result was a specimen with a high Ct value as previously measured by the comparator test, indicating low viral load. A summary of the clinical performance is shown below in Table 14.
