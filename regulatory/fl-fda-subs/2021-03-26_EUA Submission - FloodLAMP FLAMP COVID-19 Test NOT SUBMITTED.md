## F. PROPOSED INTENDED USE
### 1) Intended Use:
**FloodLAMP QuickFluor(TM) COVID-19 Test** is a reverse transcriptase loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay intended for the qualitative detection of RNA from SARS-CoV-2 in upper respiratory specimens including nasopharyngeal swabs, anterior nasal and mid-turbinate nasal swabs **from individuals suspected of COVID-19 by their healthcare provider and from individuals without symptoms or other epidemiological reasons to suspect COVID-19 infection, when tested at a weekly interval with no more than 9 days between tests.** Testing is limited to **laboratories certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA), 42 U.S.C. §263a, to perform high complexity tests, or by similarly qualified non-U.S. laboratories.** 

Results are for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA is generally detectable in upper respiratory specimens including nasopharyngeal swabs, anterior nasal and mid-turbinate nasal swabs during the acute phase of infection. Positive results are indicative of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA; clinical correlation with patient history and other diagnostic information is necessary to determine patient infection status. Positive results do not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease. Laboratories within the United States and its territories are required to report all test results to the appropriate public health authorities.

Negative results do not preclude SARS-CoV-2 infection and should not be used as the sole basis  
for patient management decisions. Negative results must be combined with clinical observations,  
patient history, and epidemiological information.

The **FloodLAMP QuickFluor(TM) COVID-19 Test** is intended for use by **qualified and trained clinical laboratory personnel specifically instructed and trained in the techniques of *in vitro* diagnostic procedures**. The **FloodLAMP QuickFluor(TM) COVID-19 Test** is only for use under the Food and Drug Administration’s Emergency Use Authorization.

### 2) Special Conditions for Use Statements:
For Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) only   
For prescription use only  
For *in vitro* diagnostic use only

### 3) Special Instrument Requirements:
The **FloodLAMP QuickFluor(TM) PCR COVID-19 Test** test is to be used with the RT-PCR instruments listed in Table 2.

#### Table 2. RT-PCR Instruments validated for test
| Manufacturer | Instrument |
| :---: | :---: |
| ThermoFisher Scientific | Applied Biosystems QuantStudio 7 Pro |
| Bio-Rad | CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System |
||

Designated laboratories will receive an FDA accepted instrument qualification protocol included as part of the **FloodLAMP QuickFluor(TM) Covid-19 Test** IFU and will be directed to execute the protocol prior to testing clinical samples. Designated laboratories must follow the authorized IFU, which includes the instrument qualification protocol, as per the letter of authorization.

## G. DEVICE DESCRIPTION AND TEST PRINCIPLE
### 1) Product Overview/Test Principle:
The **FloodLAMP QuickFluor(TM) COVID-19 Test** is an RNA-extraction free isothermal RT-LAMP assay which indicates that SARS-CoV-2 RNA is present. FloodLAMP’s test uses a set of specific primers that target ORF1ab, N and E genes for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) is a nucleic acid amplification technique wherein DNA amplification is carried out at a constant temperature of approximately 65°C. The amplification reaction mix includes a reverse transcriptase (RT) polymerase to create complementary cDNA from RNA. The cDNA is subsequently amplified by a high strand displacement DNA polymerase. An intercalating fluorescent dye is also included in the reaction mix, enabling the real time fluorescence detection of amplicons. A RT-PCR Instrument is utilized for the isothermal amplification incubation and real time fluorescence readout. 

### 2) Description of Test Steps: 
Specimens including **nasopharyngeal swabs, anterior nasal and mid-turbinate nasal swabs** are collected in **sterile collection tubes.** Swabs are transported and stored dry prior to processing. At the laboratory, an inactivation solution at 1X containing TCEP (2.5 mM), EDTA (1 mM), and NaOH (11 mM) in 0.9% saline (154 mM) is added to the container with the swab, at the volume of 1ml. Alternatively, for swabs that are collected or eluted in a saline solution or equivalent, the inactivation solution at 100X concentration should be added at 1/100th the sample solution volume. 

The container with the specimen and inactivation solution is mixed by vortexing for 30 seconds. Subsequently, the container is heated in a 95°C water bath or dry heat block for 8 minutes. The now inactivated specimen container is allowed to cool at room temperature for 10 minutes and then stored on ice or at 4°C until amplification.

An amplification reaction mix (23 µL) is prepared per manufacturer's specifications, containing the Fluorimetric LAMP master mix (New EB E1700, 12.5 µL), Fluorescent Dye (NEB E1700, .5 µL) a 10X LAMP Primer Mix (2.5 µL of 10X w FIP/BIP at 16 µM, F3/B3 at 2 µM, and LF/BF at 4 µM), and nuclease-free water (7.5 µL). 

2µL of the inactivated sample is added to 23µL of the amplification reaction mix. The reaction is then run with the following thermocycler conditions in Table 3:

#### Table 3. Thermal cycling conditions and plate read steps 
| Stage | Temperature | Time | Reps |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | 65 C | 10 sec | 1 |
| 2 | 65 C | 10 sec | 1 |
| 3 | 65 C | 30 sec | 25 |
| 3 | 65\* C | 30 sec | 25 |
||

*\* This step should be the optical read step*

### 3) Control Materials to be Used with FloodLAMP QuickFluor(TM) COVID-19 Test:
**One Positive Template Control and one Negative (No Template) Control** will be included on every 96-well plate with up to 94 samples, or with every batch of strip tubes. 

1) A **“No Template” (Negative) Control (NTC) is needed to assure the absence of cross-contamination from positive samples, positive controls, or amplicons** and is used **to determine if sample results are valid.** **It consists of nuclease-free water.**  
     
2) A **Positive Template Control is needed to assure proper functioning of reagents and the absence of significant RNAse contamination. It consists of synthetic viral RNA at a concentration of approximately 100,000 cp/mL diluted in total human RNA and nuclease-free water.** Stock and working aliquots of the positive control are produced from the sources listed in Table 4 or equivalents. Working aliquots should be diluted prior to use to 100,000 cp/mL. Positive control aliquots should be stored for at most 3 months at \-80°C, or at most 1 month at \-20°C.  

#### Table 4. Components for Positive Template Control

## H. INTERPRETATION OF Results
### 1) FloodLAMP QuickFluor(TM) COVID-19 Test Controls
All test controls should be examined prior to interpretation of patient specimen results. If the controls are not valid and the expected result, the specimen results cannot be interpreted. Target results for the controls will be interpreted according to Table 5 below.

1) The “No Template” (Negative) Control (NTC) should yield a negative “not detected” result for the Sars target.  
     
2) The Positive Template Control should yield a positive “detected” result for the Sars target.

If the negative and positive controls do not appear as expected, the specimen results of the corresponding plate or batch should be considered invalid. In the event of a failure of either the positive or negative control, the lab should discard some or all of the consumables utilized for associated run, including the filter tips, tubes, plates, seals, and aliquots of reagents. Additionally, all pipettes, BSC, and appropriate lab surfaces should be thoroughly cleaned with freshly made 10% bleach solution, 70% ethanol, and (optionally) RNAseZAP(TM) product. In the event of the failure of the positive control, the working aliquot of positive control material should be discarded. Additionally, the lab should review the expiration of the batch of positive control aliquots and verify their integrity by performing qualification reactions of one or more positive control aliquots. If controls continue to fail, labs should not perform additional tests on clinical specimens or report results. Invalid test results should be repeated by performing another amplification reaction.

### 2) Examination and Interpretation of Patient Specimen Results:
Assessment of clinical specimen test results should be performed after the positive and negative controls have been examined and determined to be valid and acceptable. If the controls are not valid, the patient results cannot be interpreted. Patient specimen results will be interpreted according to Table 5 below.

The **FloodLAMP QuickFluor(TM) COVID-19 Test** uses 18 LAMP primers targeted for 3 different SARS-CoV-2 genes, with 6 primers for each target. Primer names and sequences are shown above in Table 1. All 18 primers are mixed together and input into a single amplification reaction. 

Primers may be purchased from the vendor LGC Biosearch Technologies as 3 pre-blended sets, or the primers may be purchased as 18 individual custom oligos. Table 6 below lists the primer products to be ordered. 

The LGC Biosearch primer products are provided already blended for each target (6 primers per tube) and dried such that upon resuspension with 1 mL of nuclease-free water, the primers for each target are at 30X concentration. One resuspended tube for each of the 3 targets (i.e. primer blends) are mixed together to yield a 3 mL total volume that contains all individual primers at 10X concentration. This 3 mL of 10X LAMP Primer Mix provides for 1,200 reactions at 2.5 µL per reaction.

Alternatively to the pre-blended LGC Biosearch products, primers may be purchased as individual custom oligos. Custom oligos may be blended to form 30X Primer Set Mixes as intermediates or all mixed together for the 10X LAMP Primer Mix. The FIP and BIP primers for each target require purification by HPLC or an equivalent process. Appropriate validation of primer mixes from custom oligos is required. Primers may be stored at 4°C for up to one month, or at \-20°C for up to 1 year.

### 4) Software Validation:
The **FloodLAMP QuickFluor(TM) COVID-19 Test** has been validated on the RT-PCR instruments listed in Table 2 using the baseline threshold settings unless otherwise noted in the Instructions for Use. The test does not require any additional software.

### 5) Testing Capabilities: 
The **FloodLAMP QuickFluor(TM) COVID-19 Test** has been optimized for a streamlined workflow and rapid turnaround time on results. The total time to perform the test is dependent upon the following factors: number of lab technicians, batch size of samples, and in advance preparation of reaction mixes as well as availability of RT-qPCR instruments. The minimum turnaround time is approximately 1 hour, of which approximately 30 minutes is the RT-PCR instrument run time. Automation can greatly increase overall throughput.

### 6) Reagent Stability: 
A stability test plan for the components of the **FloodLAMP QuickFluor(TM) COVID-19 Test** will be developed during an interactive review. Briefly, the proposed study includes assessing all prepared solutions including: 100X Inactivation Solution, 1X Inactivation Saline Solution, 30X Primer Stock, 10X Primer Mix, and the full Fluorimetric LAMP Amplification Reaction Mix. Prepared solutions will be assessed both for long term storage stability (typically 1-3 months at \-20oC) and short term storage stability prior to usage (typically hours to several days at room temperature, 4oC or \-20oC). 

The proposed study uses a contrived positive sample consisting of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus cell lysate (BEI NR-52287) spiked into negative specimens at approximately 50,000 copies/mL (4X LoD). The contrived positive stability study samples will be prepared, aliquoted and stored at \-80oC to permit repeated testing of the various solutions at the appropriate step of the test protocol.

For test components supplied by vendors, such as the Fluorimetric LAMP Kit, the manufacturer's recommended storage conditions and duration will be followed.

### 7) Sample Stability:
Upper respiratory specimens including nasopharyngeal swabs, anterior nasal and mid-turbinate nasal swabs should be collected using standard procedures and recommendations. Swab specimens should be collected in 0.9% saline, PBS, or dry tubes. Specimens should not be collected in UTM, VTM, or Liquid Amies.

Please refer to Interim Guidelines for Collecting, Handling, and Testing Clinical Specimens for COVID-19: [www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/guidelines-clinical-specimens.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/guidelines-clinical-specimens.html)

The stability study of the nasal swab sample transported in saline has been conducted by Quantigen Biosciences, with support from The Gates Foundation and UnitedHealth Group. Quantigen Biosciences has granted a right of reference to any sponsor wishing to pursue an EUA to leverage their COVID-19 swab stability data as part of that sponsor’s EUA request.

Samples can be stored at room temperature for 56 hours after collection prior to inactivation. For longer term storage, samples can be stored at ≤-70oC.

## J. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
### 1) Limit of Detection (LoD) \- Analytical Sensitivity:
The Limit of Detection (LoD) for the **FloodLAMP QuickFluor(TM) COVID-19 Test** was established using gamma irradiated SARS-CoV-2 virus cell lysate (BEI NR-52287) spiked into negative real specimens. The negative specimens were confirmed by PCR using the CDC primers. The gamma irradiated virus was spiked into the specimen prior to the heat inactivation step, and carried through the entire assay. The concentration of spike was such that the contrived positive sample was at 100,000 copies/mL after the inactivation step. The stock contrived positive was diluted into inactivated negative sample matrix to produce the concentrations for the LOD study. A preliminary LOD run was performed using the concentrations ranging from 100,000 copies/mL to 3,100 copies/mL. Concentrations of 50,000, 25,000 and 12,500 copies/mL  were selected for confirmatory LOD runs. LOD run details are provided in Supporting Data, with the results summarized below in Table 10. The LOD, defined as the concentration at which at least 95% of the samples are positive, was determined at 50,000 copies/mL.

### 2) Inclusivity (analytical sensitivity): 
An inclusivity study was conducted for the ORF1ab, N2, and E1 primer sets against all complete, high coverage SARS-CoV-2 sequences deposited at GISAID as of February 27, 2021. Table 11 summarizes the results of this in silico inclusivity analysis. A total of 498,224 sequences were considered. There are 10 sequence isolates that have 1mm to both As1e and E1 and had N2 excluded due to greater than 15 N's, with the other 498,214 sequence isolates all have at least 1 target region that is a complete match.

Each primer set matched at 100% similarity against the SARS-CoV-2 RefSeq reference genome (Wuhan-Hu-1; NC\_045512.1). All three primer sets differed by one or fewer mutations for 99.7% of GISAID sequences, indicating nominal primer hybridization for all SARS-CoV-2 variants under consideration.

#### Evaluation of Impact of Viral Mutations
The As1e, E1 and N2 primer regions of all SARS-CoV-2 genomes present in GISAID as of 2/26/2021 were evaluated to assess the potential impact of genomic variants on LAMP primer binding. This analysis was performed with the Primer Monitoring Tool from New England Biolabs ([primer-monitor.neb.com](https://primer-monitor.neb.com/)), which continually monitors registered primer sets for overlapping variants in sequences from GISAID. Results are summarized by region and locus below in Table 12, including the 30 countries with most sequences in GISAID. Sequences were aligned to the SARS-CoV-2 reference sequence (NC\_045512.2) using minimap2 (minimap2 \-t 16 \-x asm5 \-a). Variant sites (excluding Ns) were identified using samtools mpileup and summarized by region and genome position. Genomic positions having \>= 40 global variant observations are shown (column labels). When present, box labels indicate the fraction of variants observed at a given locus.

The aggregate of current published mutations are not expected to reduce performance of the **FloodLAMP QuickFluor(TM) COVID-19 Test**  by more than 5% from that established by the performance evaluation in this EUA submission. Further, the use of 3 primer sets targeting different regions in the SARS-CoV-2 genome should make the test robust to new genetic variants.

### 3) Cross-reactivity (Analytical Specificity):  
*In silico* cross-reactivity analysis was performed by aligning the primer sequences of the **FloodLAMP QuickFluor(TM) COVID-19 Test**  against sequences of other coronaviruses and common respiratory flora using the BLASTn alignment tool from NCBI. Results of this analysis are presented in Tables 14A, 14B, and 14C. 

The % identity range (\# identical bases/ \# primer bases) is shown for each primer and organism. Darker font indicates % identity greater than 80%. Organisms with \>= 50% identity primer hits are shown. This analysis is not intended to predict amplification. Near perfect homology across B3, F3, FIP and BIP is necessary to support successful amplification. With the exception of SARS-CoV, simultaneous homologies do not occur between any of the primers and microorganisms screened. With respect to clinical relevance of the in silico cross-reactivity analysis, there are no known circulating strains of SARS-CoV circulating in humans, thus the overall probability for the test to produce a cross-reactive signal is negligible.

Wet testing was performed to demonstrate that the **FloodLAMP QuickFluor(TM) COVID-19 Test** does not react with related pathogens, high prevalence disease agents and normal or pathogenic flora that are reasonably likely to be encountered in a clinical specimen.  SARS-CoV, RSV, Flu, Human Metapneumovirus, and Streptococcus Salivarius were tested for potential cross-reactivity, as shown in Table 15 and Supporting Data. 5 µL of each stock of cross-reactivity organism was spiked on dried AN swab specimens. A contrived positive control was produced by spiking gamma irradiated SARS-CoV-2 virus cell lysate (BEI NR-52287) onto dried AN swab specimens. Control dried swabs obtained simultaneously were confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2 negative by PCR using the CDC primers. The gamma irradiated SARS-CoV-2 virus and cross-reactivity organisms were spiked into the dried swabs prior to the heat inactivation step, and carried through the full test protocol. The contrived positive had 38 µL of 1e6 copies/mL irradiated virus stock spiked in, producing after elution of the swab in 1 mL of Inactivation Saline Solution at most a concentration of 38,000 copies/mL in the sample input into the amplification reaction.

All wet testing showed no cross-reactivity with the viral pathogens and common respiratory flora, as shown in Table 15.

#### Table 15: Wet Testing Cross-Reactivity Results
| Organism | Description | BEI  Number | Detected Replicates |
| ----- | ----- | :---: | :---: |
| SARS-CoV | UV-inactivated virus | NR-3882 | 0/3 |
| Human Metapneumovirus | Genomic RNA | NR-49122 | 0/3 |
| RSV | Genomic RNA | NR-43976 | 0/3 |
| Influenza B | Genomic RNA | NR-45848 | 0/3 |
| Streptococcus salivarius | Bacterial cell culture | HM-121 | 0/3 |

#### Endogenous Interference Substances Studies:
Exogenous and endogenous substances were tested for potential interference with the **FloodLAMP QuickFluor(TM) COVID-19 Test*.***10 µL of each stock of interfering substance was spiked on dried AN swab specimens. A contrived positive control was produced by spiking gamma irradiated SARS-CoV-2 virus cell lysate (BEI NR-52287) onto dried AN swab specimens. Control dried swabs obtained simultaneously were confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2 negative by PCR using the CDC primers. The gamma irradiated SARS-CoV-2 virus and interfering substances were spiked into the dried swabs prior to the heat inactivation step, and carried through the full test protocol. The contrived Positive Control Spiked comprised 20 µL of 8e6 copies/mL irradiated virus stock spiked in, producing after elution of the swab in 1 mL of Inactivation Saline Solution at most a concentration of 160,000 copies/mL in the sample input into the amplification reaction.

All interfering substance testing showed no disagreement with expected positive and negative results, as shown in Table 16 and Supporting Data.

#### Table 16: Interfering Substances Results
| Interfering Substance | Active Ingredient | Concentration | % Agreement with Expected Results |  |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
|  |  |  | **Positive Control Spiked** | **Negative Control Unspiked** |

### 4) Clinical Evaluation: 
The clinical evaluation of the **FloodLAMP QuickFluor(TM) COVID-19 Test** utilized confirmed clinical anterior nares swab specimens. 40 positive and 40 negative clinical specimens were evaluated and compared to a high sensitivity EUA authorized test run on the original fresh samples. The **FloodLAMP QuickFluor(TM) COVID-19 Test** showed a positive agreement of 80% and a negative agreement of 100%. The 6 false negative results were specimens with high Ct values as previously measured by the comparator test, indicating low viral load. A summary of the clinical performance is below in Table 16.

Anterior nares swab specimens were collected from patients in phosphate buffered saline by the Stanford COVID-19 clinical testing program. Specimens were initially tested by the Stanford clinical laboratory using the Hologic Panther Fusion and Aptima SARS-CoV-2 Assays, which serves as the high sensitivity comparator test. 

For the **FloodLAMP QuickFluor(TM) COVID-19 Test**, materials and the Instructions For Use were provided to the Stanford clinical laboratory. The materials provided consisted of the validated reagents listed in Table 3, the LGC primers and probes, and an aliquot of the positive control. After thawing the frozen specimens, 1 mL of each specimen was transferred to 5mL tubes for the inactivation step. The positive and negative clinical specimens were assigned a new ID in a random order, then transferred to new tubes that were barcoded and labeled with the new ID. The Bio-Rad CFX96 instrument was used to perform the isothermal amplification. Line Item data are provided in the Supporting Data.
