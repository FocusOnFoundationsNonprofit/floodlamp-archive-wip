#### 1. FDA Updates on Serology Test Authorization Pathways

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the new serology 'umbrella pathway' and which types of serology tests does it apply to?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The new serology umbrella pathway applies to serology tests submitted to the inter-agency test group, currently tested at NCI or another authorized agency. It includes in vitro diagnostic SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests such as lateral flow assays (LFAs) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and ensures tests meet FDA-specified performance metrics to gain authorization.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the new serology 'umbrella pathway' and which types of serology tests does it apply to?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Finally, an important update, is they may have a new serology pathway, called an umbrella, pathway for serology. This high level applies to serology tests that are submitted to the inter-agency test group. Currently testing is the unintelligible at NCI, and those are companies that submit a serology monthly a rapid test that unintelligible they're able to come through their pathway. Two, this program testing is performed currently at NCI, and then if performance metrics are met then those tests have a pathway to authorization under this umbrella pathway. So I will speak a little bit to the specifics of this pathway. If it's not publicly available yet it will shortly be publicly available . So, this is for - the devices that include in vitro diagnostics, SARS CoV-2 antibodies test, lateral flow or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, LFAs, lateral flow assays. That is a validation study performed at the NCI, or another government agency designated by the FDA and are confirmed by the FDA to meet the criteria set forth in the scope of this authorization letter.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: serology umbrella pathway, test authorization process, serology test types
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the performance metrics required for authorization under the new serology umbrella pathway?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Devices must include in vitro diagnostics for SARS CoV-2 antibodies, such as LFAs or ELISAs. Validation studies must be performed by NCI or a designated agency, using panels with at least 30 SARS CoV-2 antibody-positive samples for each immunoglobulin. IgM devices need a 70% sensitivity, and IgG devices need a 90% sensitivity, with a total of 90% sensitivity and 95% specificity overall. No cross-reactivity must be demonstrated.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the performance metrics required for authorization under the new serology umbrella pathway?
VERBATIM ANSWER: This is for - the devices that include in vitro diagnostics, SARS CoV-2 antibodies test, lateral flow or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, LFAs, lateral flow assays. That is a validation study performed at the NCI, or another government agency designated by the FDA and are confirmed by the FDA to meet the criteria set forth in the scope of this authorization letter. Let me go through what those performance metrics are. All right, as performed by the NCI or another government agency designated by the FDA, using a well designed panel of at least 30 confirmed SARS CoV-2 antibodies positive, per each - and 30 per each immunoglobulin that tested unintelligible cracks, currently we're restricted with testing the IgM and IgG devices. FDA We'll say they're IG only or PAN or those thatIgM and IgG. And these are positive samples and then Ab antibody negative and/or pre-COVID-19 serum positive samples. Ten of negative samples must be confirmed to be HIV positive. The data must demonstrate a minimum overall 90% positive percent agreement, otherwise commonly thought of as sensitivity, in an overall 95% negative percent agreement or otherwise normally considered specificity, for the test to report specifically IgM and IgG results or has the ability to report a PAN result. A minimum of positive agreement for those tests that - test for and report out IgM and IgG as that for IgG there must be a minimum of 70% positive percent agreement with sensitivity of IgM and a minimum positive percent for IgG of 90%. The data must also demonstrate no cross reactivity in the testing. So this program is now available to developers and they can protest by emailing us at the template's address.

#### 3. FDA Guidelines on Asymptomatic SARS CoV-2 PCR Testing

QA Block 3-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the FDA's stance on SARS CoV-2 PCR testing of asymptomatic individuals by nasopharyngeal collection in non-healthcare settings?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA has not authorized any EUA test specifically for asymptomatic individuals. Laboratories or manufacturers need to submit an EUA for such claims, including a study demonstrating detection capability. Current authorized molecular tests can be used on asymptomatic individuals with appropriate disclaimers on test reports.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the FDA's stance on SARS CoV-2 PCR testing of asymptomatic individuals by nasopharyngeal collection in non-healthcare settings?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Currently we have not authorized an EUA test that have claims for detection of SARS CoV-2 and molecular tests for asymptomatic individuals. If a manufacturer or a laboratory wishes to make a claim about the ability to accurately detect SARS CoV-2 in an asymptomatic population, that would require a submission for that specific claim and a study powered well enough to demonstrate the capability of detecting an asymptomatic person. And we don't exactly know what the asymptomatic carrier prevalence is out there, so how many people you might have to test in order to detect that. However, if you're asking can you use any given EUA authorized molecular test, like a nasopharyngeal swab, and perform testing on an asymptomatic patient. That is not something that we're going to say - best way to put it. This is - I think falls best under a currently listed frequently asked questions, where he had said that laboratories that received samples that aren't -- I forget the terminology. That aren't validated, they can receive those samples, perform the testing, but they can also amend the reports saying if they have - know that it's an FDA asymptomatic individual, saying that their test hasn't been validated for an asymptomatic patient and that a negative result does not mean they don't have SARS CoV-2. So, again, I think the important thing is, if a developer with a lab or a manufacturer wants to claim an asymptomatic sample type, that would require an EUA authorization.

TOPICS: asymptomatic testing, nasopharyngeal swabs, EUA authorization
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 3-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the regulations or authorizations for healthcare professionals collecting swabs for SARS CoV-2 testing in asymptomatic individuals?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA does not have specific regulations regarding healthcare professionals collecting swabs from asymptomatic individuals. While self-collection is authorized (excluding nasopharyngeal swabs), no EUA tests are explicitly authorized for molecular detection in asymptomatic individuals unless a formal submission and a supporting study are provided. Labs performing such tests must indicate that their tests are not validated for asymptomatic detection and clarify that negative results do not ensure the absence of SARS CoV-2.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the regulations or authorizations for healthcare professionals collecting swabs for SARS CoV-2 testing in asymptomatic individuals?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Okay. So as far as the collection by a healthcare professional, I'm not aware of any FDA regulations that stipulates when a healthcare professional is performing the swab. We obviously have authorized self collection but now not for nasopharyngeal swab. You specifically also asked about asymptomatic individuals. Currently we have not authorized an EUA test that have claims for detection of SARS CoV-2 and molecular tests for asymptomatic individuals. If a manufacturer or a laboratory wishes to make a claim about the ability to accurately detect SARS CoV-2 in an asymptomatic population, that would require a submission for that specific claim and a study powered well enough to demonstrate the capability of detecting an asymptomatic person.

VERBATIM ANSWER: Currently we have not authorized an EUA test that have claims for detection of SARS CoV-2 and molecular tests for asymptomatic individuals. If a manufacturer or a laboratory wishes to make a claim about the ability to accurately detect SARS CoV-2 in an asymptomatic population, that would require a submission for that specific claim and a study powered well enough to demonstrate the capability of detecting an asymptomatic person. And we don't exactly know what the asymptomatic carrier prevalence is out there, so how many people you might have to test in order to detect that.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What reporting recommendations does the FDA have for labs providing results from tests that were not validated for asymptomatic populations?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends that labs amend test reports for asymptomatic samples by indicating that the test has not been validated for asymptomatic individuals and that a negative result does not rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What reporting recommendations does the FDA have for labs providing results from tests that were not validated for asymptomatic populations?
VERBATIM ANSWER: This is - I think falls best under a currently listed frequently asked questions, where he had said that laboratories that received samples that aren't -- I forget the terminology. That aren't validated, they can receive those samples, perform the testing, but they can also amend the reports saying if they have - know that it's an FDA asymptomatic individual, saying that their test hasn't been validated for an asymptomatic patient and that a negative result does not mean they don't have SARS CoV-2.

#### 5. Regulatory Challenges for Pathway D Versus EUA Products

QA Block 5-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the unintended consequences for pathway D manufacturers that sell in the US and have their tests administered at the point of sale, particularly related to the EUA requirements and restrictions?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Pathway D manufacturers can only use their tests in high-complexity labs in the US unless they obtain EUA authorization. They cannot sell directly for moderate complexity, point of care, or home use. To deal with point of care, they must prove performance in such settings for FDA approval.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the unintended consequences for pathway D manufacturers that sell in the US and have their tests administered at the point of sale, particularly related to the EUA requirements and restrictions?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So first of all, those who notify us via pathway D are only deemed to be used in the US in a high-complexity lab. They are not to be used moderate complex or in point of care or home use in any way. In order to get those - that authorization, they must come in for an EUA authorization. Also, in pathway D, those that have just notified us and have not been FDA authorized, they are formally not FDA authorized. And let's see, you had some other questions there I'm pretty sure. Oh, point of care. I just want comment on what it takes to be point of care. So, if they want to be moderately complex for point of care, they come in - they demonstrate the performance in those settings and we can deem those as point of care, and then they can be used as point of care setting. But those not authorized for those settings and those that haven't notified us cannot deem those for use for those purposes.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Is there no enforcement mechanism to ensure pathway D tests are not sold directly to point of care providers without proper authorization?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So those that have simply notified us that they have validated their test through pathway D, they are allowed under a high complexity lab certificate, if that lab sets up, say a draw on a patient, that lab is allowed to do, under their high complexity Clia certificate, under their rules, to do quote "Point of care testing". But if someone has simply notified us - a developer has notified us through pathway D, and they are selling into a point of care setting, that is not allowed, is not authorized. We have a fraud email on our FDA website, EUA website, you can send information about that and we will investigate and take action as appropriate. FDA And that said, email address is not easily available. You can always send something to our template email address.

FDA Our policy is that we will authorize point-of-care serology, and other point-of-care tests, if they meet the expectations in working with our reviewers for those applications. So, there is no prohibition about this - there is also no prohibition about home collections or home testing. It's just that in the home collection, home testing situation, those require EUA authorizations. They require specific accuracy tests to be done, so that we know in those environments accurate results can be obtained -- and the same goes for the point-of-care setting.

#### 9. HIV Cross-Reactivity Testing in Umbrella Pathway

QA Block 9-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the umbrella pathway require cross-reactivity testing specifically for HIV?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The umbrella pathway includes testing on 10 HIV-positive samples out of 80 negative samples due to concerns about possible cross-reactivity.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the umbrella pathway require cross-reactivity testing specifically for HIV?
VERBATIM ANSWER: This new umbrella is a pathway that goes through NCI and other government agencies doing the testing from 30 positive and 80 negative samples. 10 of those negative samples will be HIV positive. And that's because there is some concern of potential cross-reactivity in HIV positive samples.

TOPICS: umbrella pathway, cross-reactivity testing, HIV
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 9-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Will cross-reactivity and class specificity testing as addressed in the March 16 policy still be required under the umbrella pathway?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The specific cross-reactivity and class specificity testing addressed in the March 16 policy may not be required under the umbrella pathway if performance on 80 negative samples is good, with specificity above 98%. However, additional testing may be required if performance falls below expectations.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Will cross-reactivity and class specificity testing as addressed in the March 16 policy still be required under the umbrella pathway?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So the classic - or the other already open pathway for serological testing is still open. This new umbrella is a pathway that goes through NCI and other government agencies doing the testing from 30 positive and 80 negative samples. 10 of those negative samples will be HIV positive. And that's because there is some concern of potential cross-reactivity in HIV positive samples. So those are specifically added to look at that. We assess that if performance is good on the 80 negative samples, basically above about 98% no specific additional cross-activity testing may need to be performed with specific potential cross-reacting agents. However, if - in the usual pathways if performance falls below a level, we would ask for additional cross-reactivity testing to determine the reason why FDA specificity is lower than expected.

#### 13. Digitizing Lateral Flow Test Results for Surveillance

QA Block 13-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Has there been any consideration of digitizing lateral flow test results through a device agnostic to vendors to enable epidemiological review and data sorting?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA is open to the use of devices for digitizing lateral flow test results for public health data. Existing devices for other diseases already allow data recording and surveillance activities. As long as the technology is accurate and reliable, the FDA would authorize it. Uniformity in results across devices, especially for visually-read data like test bands, will be evaluated to ensure accuracy.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Has there been any consideration of digitizing lateral flow test results through a device agnostic to vendors to enable epidemiological review and data sorting?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. So we're totally open to such devices. There are already such devices for other respiratory diseases on the market that allow the recording of non-identifiable information and uploading for public health surveillance type activities. So we're totally open to that and as long as the technology works, is accurate, then we'll authorize that. There's a number of different ways you can go about that. I would just state though that there could be considerations or concerns about things that are - can otherwise be visually read rather than, say, read by some other means, like fluorescence, that are - where the detectors are measuring something other than FDA a visual read, and its thing like lighting and how dark the bands are and things like that, and whether or not the device you're using to record the results is uniform in the marketplace. So, an application might be very valuable but if it's able to be used - able to utilize a number of different devices, smartphone, if the camera performance, for example, doesn't have resolution, the differential ways of handle the lighting, things like that. So our expert team would evaluate the technology that you're interested in developing and using in this way, to make sure that an accurate result is recorded by such a device.

#### 14. Comparison of NP and NF Swab Effectiveness

QA Block 14-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the CDC and FDA recommendations for nasopharyngeal (NP) versus nasal (NF) swabs, particularly for testing asymptomatic individuals before returning to work?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA defers to CDC for recommendations on NP versus NF swabs. Weekly NP swabs may face challenges such as discomfort and limited availability. The FDA emphasizes the need for scientific data to support the effectiveness of nasal swabs over NP swabs and plans to provide communication updates on this topic.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the CDC and FDA recommendations for nasopharyngeal (NP) versus nasal (NF) swabs, particularly for testing asymptomatic individuals before returning to work?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So first of all I would defer to - those kinds of recommendations, as far as what the CDC perceives is being important to the CDC. I think at the same time we all realize that performance, depending on the interval, a weekly NP swab on people who might be considering going back to work, other options are being considered out there for them, could be challenging from a number of standpoints. One of them is that NP swabs might not be readily available, the FDA supply issues. Second is, anybody who has had an NP swab will know - and I have as a volunteer - they are very uncomfortable and enduring that on a weekly basis could be challenging to people. So, this is an extremely challenging question. What is the - about testing asymptomatic people, and in certain situations like returning to work, this obviously is a very important question, and exactly how this should be done is still an unknown scientifically. Is there nasal swabs as effective as an NP swab? I think more data could be collected on that and we can see - I guess, from our standpoint, if a claim is going to be made, we want that claim to be supported by data for one type of swab or another. Exactly how labs utilize their tests for this situation is perhaps something that the FDA may not specify unless their making a claim. But we are working on a communication. It may just be an update to our FAQ page about this specific topic. So we'll be as transparent and forthcoming as we can, but we realize - and we hope that you realize that this is a very challenging topic.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA advises proper randomization during clinical studies comparing different swab types, including randomizing the order of swabbing for various sample sites to ensure balanced data collection.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA have recommendations for ensuring proper randomization during clinical studies comparing different swab types?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So there are some studies that have been done out there showing the differences between nasal swabs determinant and NP swabs, and then there are some developers who have done some of that work as well. Going forward as we know that there are now patients available to do these studies, comparisons between the different swab types sensitivities for detection would be important. FDA I think it's generally wise if you're going to do interior hairs that you swab both sides of the nose. But if you're going to do studies be sure that you properly randomize how you swab for say comparison testing different devices, different tests, different molecular tests, go forward potentially direct antigen test. And then if you also obtain another sample type like unintelligible or a nasopharyngeal, you also take that into account as you randomize the sample collection. So you don't always take the nasopharyngeal swab first. You randomize whether you do that first versus another site, like nares.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: How should laboratories handle unvalidated samples used for testing asymptomatic individuals under existing FDA guidelines?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Laboratories can perform testing on unvalidated samples from asymptomatic individuals but should amend reports to indicate the test is not FDA-validated for asymptomatic patients and negative results don't rule out SARS CoV-2. Claims about accuracy for asymptomatic populations require EUA authorization.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How should laboratories handle unvalidated samples used for testing asymptomatic individuals under existing FDA guidelines?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Currently we have not authorized an EUA test that have claims for detection of SARS CoV-2 and molecular tests for asymptomatic individuals. If a manufacturer or a laboratory wishes to make a claim about the ability to accurately detect SARS CoV-2 in an asymptomatic population, that would require a submission for that specific claim and a study powered well enough to demonstrate the capability of detecting an asymptomatic person. And we don't exactly know what the asymptomatic carrier prevalence is out there, so how many people you might have to test in order to detect that. However, if you're asking can you use any given EUA authorized molecular test, like a nasopharyngeal swab, and perform testing on an asymptomatic patient. That is not something that we're going to say - best way to put it. This is - I think falls best under a currently listed frequently asked questions, where he had said that laboratories that received samples that aren't -- I forget the terminology. That aren't validated, they can receive those samples, perform the testing, but they can also amend the reports saying if they have - know that it's an FDA asymptomatic individual, saying that their test hasn't been validated for an asymptomatic patient and that a negative result does not mean they don't have SARS CoV-2. So, again, I think the important thing is, if a developer with a lab or a manufacturer wants to claim an asymptomatic sample type, that would require an EUA authorization.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Why do pathway D manufacturers not have the same restrictions as those with an EUA, such as reporting false positives and negatives or being limited to authorized uses?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Pathway D manufacturers are only allowed to operate under a high-complexity CLIA lab certificate. Selling to point-of-care settings without authorization is not permitted. Unauthorized activities can be reported to the FDA for investigation and enforcement.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Why do pathway D manufacturers not have the same restrictions as those with an EUA, such as reporting false positives and negatives or being limited to authorized uses?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So those that have simply notified us that they have validated their test through pathway D, they are allowed under a high complexity lab certificate, if that lab sets up, say a draw on a patient, that lab is allowed to do, under their high complexity Clia certificate, under their rules, to do quote "Point of care testing". But if someone has simply notified us - a developer has notified us through pathway D, and they are selling into a point of care setting, that is not allowed, is not authorized. We have a fraud email on our FDA website, EUA website, you can send information about that and we will investigate and take action as appropriate. FDA And that said, email address is not easily available. You can always send something to our template email address. But if a developer is selling something into the point of care testing world, not under a high-complexity situation, they are not authorized to do that. We will investigate and we will take action as appropriate.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What steps is the FDA taking to make validation panels more accessible to developers?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is working to identify and share providers of validation panels with developers, including listing them on their FAQs or providing contact information upon request. However, there are no guarantees regarding their quality since the materials are not FDA-reviewed. The agency is also striving to make these materials as accessible as possible.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What steps is the FDA taking to make validation panels more accessible to developers?
VERBATIM ANSWER: There is not any sort of FDA panel, commercially available panel at this time, in hopes that, that could be happening. I've asked and I haven't checked whether our FAQ page lists potential providers of validation panels. For those providers of such panels, we have a process by which we engage firms, and if we feel it's something that we can make widely available to developers, as far as information goes, you can go to these providers, we will do that. We have had some providers approach us and I asked that they be reviewed and we can post one on the FAQs if we haven't already. We would post them. However we do know some providers, and if you email us at EUA template, we FDA can at least give you contact information. And if it's not on our FAQ page it would basically be information without any guarantee that - at this moment, that we've taken a look at them and we know that that's a good provider. But I know that there are providers out there that are developing these panels and as soon as possible we'll make as many of them as possible, unintelligible FAQ page, and if we get to the point where we can specifically recommend something we will do that. We understand that is challenging to get these materials.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the anticipated timeline for releasing formal FDA guidance or information on 3-D printed nasopharyngeal swabs?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is finalizing guidance on 3-D printed nasopharyngeal swabs, which may be posted as early as next week, though this is not guaranteed.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the anticipated timeline for releasing formal FDA guidance or information on 3-D printed nasopharyngeal swabs?
VERBATIM ANSWER: What I can share at this point is we most certainly are preparing formal information or guidance. I don't want to be too prescriptive of what form it will take, but we are working on, what I believe the community will find to be very informative based on the questions that have come in so far. And then there's a process that we go through internally to have that verbiage cleared, it will probably be out of our office this week and moving up through the necessary channels with posting hopefully as early as next week. I'm not making that promise but we certainly have been striving to get all of this information together and presented to the public as quickly as we can, because I know there are many, many questions and many people trying to address shortages through these very creative manufacturing means.

This includes publishing forthcoming guidance, hosting discussions for open dialogue, and leveraging interagency expertise to track and evaluate data while ensuring regulatory compliance for these devices.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How does the FDA plan to harmonize efforts across interagency partnerships to ensure the safety and effectiveness of 3-D printed swabs?
VERBATIM ANSWER: What I can share at this point is we most certainly are preparing formal information or guidance. I don't want to be too prescriptive of what form it will take, but we are working on, what I believe the community will find to be very informative based on the questions that have come in so far.

I'm not making that promise but we certainly have been striving to get all of this information together and presented to the public as quickly as we can, because I know there are many, many questions and many people trying to address shortages through these very creative manufacturing means. So that's one thing I'll say. The two other points on that. One is that we do intend to have an open discussion, a town hall- like forum, where folks who are interested in a dialogue with FDA and other federal partners can join in sort of an open-dialogue and those of you who have reached out by email following this town halls would certainly be welcome and any others would be welcome as well. So we're shooting to get that conversation set up and broadcast to the appropriate parties at some point next week. Again, thanks for your patience and stay tuned. The last piece on this and related to that is our internal team, which includes subject matter experts, policy folks, regulatory experts, legal folks, the whole gamut, we've been following the literature closely, including data that has been FDA submitted to us for analysis and data that's been submitted to federal partners, including NIH and VA, too as, I believe most folks know we have an interagency partnership with -- on 3-D printing and additive manufacturing. And so there are many experts across FDA our agency partners who are trying to stay ahead of the curve with regards to what's being manufactured and advertised and marketed and used out in the field. So, in coordinating with those folks and stakeholders that have reached out to FDA and other parts of the government, we're looking for a sort of harmonized way that we can all work together safely and get products out there that are going to be effective and safe, and then also where that fits into our regulatory framework given that these traditionally have been class 1 exempt devices.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the FDA have any preferences or thoughts regarding the use of NP versus NF swabs?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA does not have specific preferences between NP and NF swabs and defers to CDC recommendations. The performance of nasal and NP swabs varies and more data is needed to assess effectiveness. Testing asymptomatic individuals poses challenges, and FDA guidance will focus on data-supported claims.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA have any preferences or thoughts regarding the use of NP versus NF swabs?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So first of all I would defer to - those kinds of recommendations, as far as what the CDC perceives is being important to the CDC. I think at the same time we all realize that performance, depending on the interval, a weekly NP swab on people who might be considering going back to work, other options are being considered out there for them, could be challenging from a number of standpoints. One of them is that NP swabs might not be readily available, the FDA supply issues. Second is, anybody who has had an NP swab will know - and I have as a volunteer - they are very uncomfortable and enduring that on a weekly basis could be challenging to people. So, this is an extremely challenging question. What is the - about testing asymptomatic people, and in certain situations like returning to work, this obviously is a very important question, and exactly how this should be done is still an unknown scientifically. Is there nasal swabs as effective as an NP swab? I think more data could be collected on that and we can see - I guess, from our standpoint, if a claim is going to be made, we want that claim to be supported by data for one type of swab or another. Exactly how labs utilize their tests for this situation is perhaps something that the FDA may not specify unless their making a claim. But we are working on a communication. It may just be an update to our FAQ page about this specific topic. So we'll be as transparent and forthcoming as we can, but we realize - and we hope that you realize that this is a very challenging topic.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is the FDA conducting or planning to conduct studies on the effectiveness of NF versus NP swabs?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Some studies and developer work have compared nasal swabs to NP swabs. The FDA notes that further studies with randomized sampling are needed to confirm performance differences. Initial findings suggest a slight performance drop when moving from NP to nasal swabs.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is the FDA conducting or planning to conduct studies on the effectiveness of NF versus NP swabs?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So there are some studies that have been done out there showing the differences between nasal swabs determinant and NP swabs, and then there are some developers who have done some of that work as well. Going forward as we know that there are now patients available to do these studies, comparisons between the different swab types sensitivities for detection would be important. FDA I think it's generally wise if you're going to do interior hairs that you swab both sides of the nose. But if you're going to do studies be sure that you properly randomize how you swab for say comparison testing different devices, different tests, different molecular tests, go forward potentially direct antigen test. And then if you also obtain another sample type like unintelligible or a nasopharyngeal, you also take that into account as you randomize the sample collection. So you don't always take the nasopharyngeal swab first. You randomize whether you do that first versus another site, like nares. So, I don't think we have definitive evidence yet about how much performance you might lose going from a nasopharyngeal to a nares, even bilateral nares, even at a healthcare group study was pretty well done, but the numbers maybe could be added to with other studies. But it did show that there is a potential small drop off in sensitivities when you go from nasopharyngeal to anterior nasal swab.
