CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends conducting a two-week clinical study for COVID-flu tests to collect performance data. If enough flu-positive specimens are not obtained, a banked sample study using archived clinical samples may follow. Challenges with flu sample availability can be discussed with the FDA, and a post-authorization study might also be required.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What clinical validation strategies does the FDA recommend to support authorization of a multi-analyte test given the low prevalence of flu rates?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So we have discussed this on this call previously as well. And we do continue to recommend using a perfective clinical study to evaluate the clinical performance of your COVID-flu combined test. And we would recommend that you conduct that study for at least two weeks. And after the two-week duration, if you're not able to collect the recommended number of positive flu specimens, you can then proceed with a clinical validation study using banked samples at one of your testing sites. And if you do that, we recommend that you test archived positive and negative clinical samples. And we do recognize that there was a reduced prevalence of influenza last season and that archived specimens may be difficult to obtain. But that is still our current recommendation to support authorization. And you can come in and discuss that with us if you're having trouble reaching those recommended numbers. And then generally we would also consider adding a post-authorization commitment for a clinical study. And we would discuss that with you during the review of your EUA.

#### 7. Regulatory Requirements for Legally Marketed Nasal Swabs

QA Block 7-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can we use nasal swabs that are not listed in the 510k premarket notification database?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Swabs are typically 510k-exempt and do not require premarket review if they comply with regulatory requirements like registration and listing, which can be checked in FDA databases. Sterile swabs should meet the quality system requirements under 21 CFR 820. Swabs with viral transport media may require premarket review and will be listed in the 510k database if cleared. Swabs purchased from third parties are acceptable if they comply with relevant regulations and are appropriately labeled.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can we use nasal swabs that are not listed in the 510k premarket notification database?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah, so swabs typically are 510k-exempt devices, which means that they don't generally require premarket review. So they're considered to be legally marketed if they comply with other regulatory requirements, including registration and listing. So the FDA registration and listing database includes all device manufacturers and devices that are registered and listed. And so you can search that database for the specific swab manufacturer and specific swabs that you're looking at. So typically, swabs that are used for upper respiratory collection should be sterile. And so the requirements for the sterile swabs do include manufacturing under 21 CFR 820, which is the quality system regulation for medical devices. And then there are some swabs including those that are provided with viral transport media that are not exempt from premarket review. And so those swabs will be listed in the 510k database once they're cleared. And in terms of purchasing from third parties and distributors, that is certainly acceptable. Swabs can be purchased from third parties or distributors as long as they are also following the pertinent regulations that apply to them. And for any medical device including swabs, the outer packaging must include information that's noted in the labeling regulations. This would include the manufacturer and product name along with other information that's noted in that regulation. And then as I mentioned before, you can look in the registration and listing database to make sure that swab is listed there. And if it's not listed in the registration and listing database, then it may not be a legally marketed swab. And you should consider switching to one to a swab that is legally marketed to acquire a patient sample since you should be using sterile and appropriately marketed swabs for collection of patient samples.

#### 8. Comparator and Investigational Test Sequencing Clarification Discussion

QA Block 8-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Could you clarify the sequence for collecting comparator swabs versus investigational swabs for a rapid molecular test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA generally recommends randomizing the order of collecting comparator and investigational swabs in clinical evaluations, unless the comparator swab is used for standard of care or treatment, in which case taking it first should be considered.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Could you clarify the sequence for collecting comparator swabs versus investigational swabs for a rapid molecular test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Generally, the recommendation to collect the comparator swab first is specific to if you're using the comparator also for treatment. If it's being used for standard of care, then that should be taken into consideration. But the template does discuss that the order should be randomized in your clinical evaluation. So we would want to see that generally that the order is random so that there's not a preference given to one or the other of the tests being performed.

REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 8-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the FDA have specific guidance for sequencing comparator and investigational swabs in over-the-counter tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA advises that the sequencing of comparator and investigational swabs in over-the-counter tests should generally follow a randomized order in clinical evaluations, particularly if the comparator is not being used for standard of care. For over-the-counter settings, randomization provides flexibility, and a washout period is recommended to allow mucosa to regenerate.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA have specific guidance for sequencing comparator and investigational swabs in over-the-counter tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah, thanks for that question. I can get this started, and then I'll see if Kris wants to add anything. So generally, the recommendation to collect the comparator swab first is generally specific to if you're using the comparator also for treatment. If it's being used for standard of care, then that should be taken into consideration. But the template does discuss that the order should be randomized in your clinical evaluation. So we would want to see that generally that the order is random so that there's not a preference given to one or the other of the tests being performed. Randomization I think is a path forward especially for some instances where, as Toby mentioned, that first and the comparator method is not being used for standard of care. So allowing folks to do that, take a randomized approach, you know maybe it allows some flexibility in a trial if you're executing something at home or in some setting in which it's more difficult to ensure that one is taken first or second. So it's just something you could discuss with your lead reviewer. You could send it to templates email box. And that's fine as well. And then I think in that case, we recommend what we call a washout period or something to ensure that there is sufficient time for that mucosa to regenerate.

#### 10. EUA Review Prioritization and Timeline Expectations

QA Block 10-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What does the time frame look like in the review cycle for new EUA filings?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA performs an initial triage review to identify public health concerns and prioritizes EUA submissions with high public health impacts. The review time depends on submission priorities and completeness, with priority tests reviewed faster.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What does the time frame look like in the review cycle for new EUA filings?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Sure. So if you are receiving two-week notices but you haven't gotten a reviewer yet, that generally indicates that you are sort of in the queue but may not be top priority for a review, if you will. And each EUA request that comes in, we do an initial triage review to determine if there are any glaring public health concerns with the submission, in which case we would-- if it's a test that's already being offered, which isn't typically the case anymore since all of those should already be in house given the updated November 15 policy. But also, we look at whether there's a high potential impact on public health if it's a priority submission. And we do prioritize those for review regardless of whether there are other submissions that are sitting in the queue. And so it's hard to give a firm answer on the timeline for an EUA request, even for a new EUA request. We do recommend that you consider the priorities that are included in the policy. And submissions that include priority tests and that include complete information are generally going to get through review faster.

VERBATIM ANSWER: So we do have some information in the templates regarding variant testing. Generally, it is at a high level that we do expect developers to consider the variants that are currently circulating and to have a plan for ensuring that their test is not negatively impacted by future potential variants. So given that things are changing, having that plan is really the critical part and not necessarily forever specifying a specific panel.

#### 21. Clarifying Sample Types for FDA-Authorized Serology Tests

QA Block 21-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: If a serology test is authorized for nasopharyngeal swabs and the intended use specifies nasopharyngeal swabs, can it also be used for anterior nasal swabs since nasopharyngeal swabs are considered more challenging?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Tests must be used according to their authorization. If a test is only authorized for nasopharyngeal swabs, there is likely a specific reason for this. FDA is not aware of any serology tests authorized for nasopharyngeal swabs.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If a serology test is authorized for nasopharyngeal swabs and the intended use specifies nasopharyngeal swabs, can it also be used for anterior nasal swabs since nasopharyngeal swabs are considered more challenging?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So for molecular tests, we have typically authorized multiple respiratory sample types if nasopharyngeal is studied. But the tests should always be used according to their authorization. So if it is only authorized for nasopharyngeal, there may be a reason why. And, again, I don't believe that we have any serology tests authorized for nasopharyngeal. So that definitely would need to be looked at.

#### 22. Randomization and Sample Collection in Rapid Antigen Studies

QA Block 22-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Do you have guidance on alternation for self-test versus NP swab collection across sites?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends randomizing the order between self-tests and NP swabs when the comparator is not for standard of care. Guidance may be in the templates, and specific cases can be sent to the FDA mailbox or considered for pre-EUA consultation.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Do you have guidance on alternation for self-test versus NP swab collection across sites?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. I think this is a question that came up earlier on the call as well. If the comparator is not being used for standard of care, then randomizing between which one goes first is beneficial. And there should be some information in the templates, I think, that discusses this. So I would recommend that you take a look at that. And if you have a specific question or want to specifically confirm in your situation that you're running your studies as we would recommend, you can send that it to the mailbox. And we can take a look. If it's quite in depth, we would recommend a pre-EUA.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can swabs purchased from third-party distributors meet all relevant regulatory requirements?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Swabs purchased from third-party distributors can meet regulatory requirements if they follow applicable regulations, including proper labeling and registration in the FDA database. Use sterile and legally marketed swabs for patient sample collection.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can swabs purchased from third-party distributors meet all relevant regulatory requirements?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Swabs can be purchased from third parties or distributors as long as they are also following the pertinent regulations that apply to them. And for any medical device including swabs, the outer packaging must include information that's noted in the labeling regulations. This would include the manufacturer and product name along with other information that's noted in that regulation. And then as I mentioned before, you can look in the registration and listing database to make sure that swab is listed there. And if it's not listed in the registration and listing database, then it may not be a legally marketed swab.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What kind of priority review can we expect on a new EUA filing?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA prioritizes EUA submissions based on public health concerns and potential impact. Submissions with high priority and complete information are reviewed more quickly, but no specific timeline can be guaranteed.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What kind of priority review can we expect on a new EUA filing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Sure. So if you are receiving two-week notices but you haven't gotten a reviewer yet, that generally indicates that you are sort of in the queue but may not be top priority for a review, if you will. And each EUA request that comes in, we do an initial triage review to determine if there are any glaring public health concerns with the submission, in which case we would-- if it's a test that's already being offered, which isn't typically the case anymore since all of those should already be in house given the updated November 15 policy. But also, we look at whether there's a high potential impact on public health if it's a priority submission. And we do prioritize those for review regardless of whether there are other submissions that are sitting in the queue. And so it's hard to give a firm answer on the timeline for an EUA request, even for a new EUA request. We do recommend that you consider the priorities that are included in the policy. And submissions that include priority tests and that include complete information are generally going to get through review faster.
