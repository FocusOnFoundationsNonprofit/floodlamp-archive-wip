#### 1. FDA Updates on EUA Applications and Pooling Strategies

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the expectations for validation when using the notification pathway to market tests before EUA authorization?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA uses the honor system for tests submitted via the notification pathway before EUA authorization, expecting validation to be well-conducted and performance acceptable, given the urgent demand for testing during the pandemic.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the expectations for validation when using the notification pathway to market tests before EUA authorization?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We have hundreds of EUA applications in house. And the vast majority of these have come through the notification pathway so that they are able to if they do that if that's allowed to them you are all able to go out and market your test prior to EUA authorization. It is the honor system. We expect that the validations have been done well, the performance is acceptable and we thank you for that. We allowed this pathway in this pandemic because of the absolute huge need to provide testing in abundance as soon as possible.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: EUA notification pathway, Validation expectations, COVID-19 testing
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How should developers prioritize their contact with the FDA once an EUA application has been submitted?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Developers should work closely with their assigned FDA contact, established within two weeks of submission, and obtain weekly updates. New technologies requiring EUA before market launch are given higher priority.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How should developers prioritize their contact with the FDA once an EUA application has been submitted?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Please work closely with the contact that we've provided. Again for EUAs, not pre-EUAs, for EUAs direct to the office make sure that every EUA applicant has a contact within two weeks of submission hopefully less time now. And that's important that you have a contact that you can get at least weekly updates from. Those that do require an EUA prior to launch they obviously get triaged. For those new submissions new technologies that require an EUA, they do get higher priority because they are waiting EUA authorization to be able to get to the market versus those who come through the notification pathway.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: EUA submission, FDA contact prioritization, New technology prioritization
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What factors are used to triage EUA applications that require authorization before launch?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA prioritizes new submissions and technologies requiring EUA before launch, as they depend on authorization to enter the market. This takes precedence over products using the notification pathway.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What factors are used to triage EUA applications that require authorization before launch?
VERBATIM ANSWER: those that do require an EUA prior to launch they obviously get triaged. For those new submissions new technologies that require an EUA, they do get higher priority because they are waiting EUA authorization to be able to get to the market versus those who come through the notification pathway.

QA Block 1-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What guidelines exist for using pooling as a method to manage increased testing demand?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA guidelines for pooling require ensuring a PPA of 85% relative to single tests, validating a pooling scheme, and notifying FDA within 15 business days. Pooling should account for the distribution of positivity levels in the lab, balancing throughput with detection. Labs can continue testing during this process unless directed otherwise.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What guidelines exist for using pooling as a method to manage increased testing demand?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Pooling in all cases appears to decrease the percent positive rate that is low positives are going to be missed. And that's just a given if you start pooling. We want to limit those misses to an acceptable level. And our updated templates call for a PPA relative to single tests on the platform of 85%. You can pool up to as many as you want as long as you hit that number. We are asking for an even distribution of levels of positivity so a good range of low positive and high positives, up to high positives. So there's not an overabundance of either, an overabundance of low positives if it doesn't match your distribution in your lab which is the ideal thing is to match the distribution your lab sees then, you know, it's not as helpful. So we'll work closely with you to make sure that that distribution is good. The pathway for pooling additions both for kit developers as well as labs to alter kits and/or alter their own LDTs is through the notification pathways. So validate whatever pool scheme you want to use. Make sure the performance is good. On the honor system, you can notify us and submit your data within 15 days. All the while, 15 business days, all the while continuing the test pools unless you hear any concerns from us.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Pooling guidelines, Testing demand, FDA notification
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-5
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How should laboratories and developers determine acceptable performance levels for pooled tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Laboratories and developers should achieve a PPA of 85% relative to single tests on the platform for pooled tests. They can pool as many samples as necessary while ensuring this performance level and an even distribution of positivity levels that reflect the lab's typical sample distribution.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How should laboratories and developers determine acceptable performance levels for pooled tests?

TOPICS: Pooling validation, Sample distribution, Testing optimization
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-8
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Why might different labs achieve varying outcomes when validating pooling with the same test kit?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The variability arises primarily from the assay's limit of detection, with more sensitive assays missing fewer positives, and from the distribution of low positives in each lab's sample history, which helps determine an optimal pooling scheme.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Why might different labs achieve varying outcomes when validating pooling with the same test kit?
VERBATIM ANSWER: It seems to be driven by two different things at least but these are probably the major drivers of pooling success. And that is the LOD of the assay. Obviously a more sensitive assay will be less likely to miss the average low positive than a test that is pooled that has not as great a sensitivity. And then second is the distribution of low positives in a given labs menu and experience. So it's important to understand historically what your low positive rate is. We like to see CTs historically for the labs to help them guide them to the right pool scheme. It will give them great performance with pooling and balance the need to increase throughput with getting an acceptable performance and not missing a lot of positives.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Pooling validation, Assay sensitivity, Lab-specific factors
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-9
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the role of the assay's limit of detection (LOD) in the success of a pooling strategy?

VERBATIM QUESTION: What considerations should developers keep in mind for obtaining authorization for semi-quant and neutralizing antibody tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: And then finally I wanted to mention that recently we did authorize the first semi-quant serology test in fact there were two of them that we authorized semi-quant, quant and neutralizing antibody serology tests will be a priority going forward. There is a lot of interest relative to vaccines as you might guess. So we are working closely with any party that any developer that wants to advance development of these tests.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA permits evaluating user-dependent factors such as time, volume, and lighting conditions analytically in the lab, without relying on direct patient material. Refer to the serology template for detailed instructions.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What options are available for validating user-dependent factors in serology tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. So I think you're talking about a serology test. And I do believe it does give you options on how to do that. Primarily we want to understand how does the test perform, if they are available that aren't controlled by the test themselves that are user-dependent time, volume observations. And even if you have a, you know, like a smartphone reader the lighting conditions matter. So for those Toby, you know, might have this more at your fingertips than me but those things can be tested more analytically in the lab rather than with actual finger sticks. And I'm just going to that section but I don't think I have time to go to it right now. But any additional questions that aren't clear from the template, the serology template for commercial manufacturers please just ask our team. But I believe there is advice for how to do that without having to use actual patient, direct patient material.

So I without knowing the details of the process and your specific situation it's hard for me to advise. Where possible we do want to follow the EUA route. We do follow closely the regs and guidance obviously for determination of what qualifies for an EUA. And we've been in some cases in many cases very flexible in adopting those things into the EUA process. For example, multi-virus or multianalyte panel testing isn't something that was too clearly, you know, something that's a EUA because it detects viruses and other respiratory pathogens that aren't directly COVID related. So if you've gone to the halt and I hate to suggest this because my e-mail box is crazy but if you send it to me and you copy Toby so send it to the templates email address ask Toby and Tim. or Dr. Stenzel copied I'll get to it as soon as we can and help unblock this and make some specific suggestions for you to help your out.

#### 6. Guidelines for EUA and Screening Test Requirements

QA Block 6-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Do we still need to submit an EUA for university student testing if it's completed under a health care provider order for high-risk status?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: If the test in use is already EUA-authorized and performed under a health care provider prescription, no new EUA is needed unless seeking to claim specific performance levels for screening. Templates and pathways exist for cases needing claims or entirely new tests.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Do we still need to submit an EUA for university student testing if it's completed under a health care provider order for high-risk status?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So our - when it comes to molecular diagnostics tests and use in screening, if the test that you're using is a EUA authorized and/or notified a test and it doesn't have any particular limitations, maybe due to some sensitivity or some issues that we've seen, then they can be used in the screening slash asymptomatic population when there is a health care worker prescription order. And we're allowing that very clearly on our FAQ site. FAQs we encourage labs to accept these samples even though they may be screening or asymptomatic patients if they have valid orders and to report those results. And for that purpose, there's no necessary change to a EUA unless that EUA wants to claims, you know, that they have a certain level of performance in the screening population. And then we will want to see data in the screening population that would support that claim that their test has a certain level of performance in the asymptomatic or screening population. And our templates go into a lot of different details about, you know, how to go about getting that. So for example, if you're, if you already have a EUA authorized test, you know, there's a pathway to add that screening asymptomatic claim. If you're, have an entirely new test and you want to go directly for that asymptomatic pathway if you want to have an OTC test there's a different pathway, et cetera, et cetera. So the details have gotten such that it's hard for me to keep them all straight but it's all laid out in the templates if you have any questions about that. But if you're not going for, you know, wanting to advertise that you're testing has a certain performance in the screening asymptomatic population you're fine. Just accepting the health care worker orders slash prescription, doing the testing and reporting it. Hopefully, that helps.

Broader claims involving multiple platforms could be more difficult due to test variabilities.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can we proceed to test individuals, provide them qualitative data per the third party's IFU, capture the validation data, and compile it into a EUA application in parallel?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. So that would be considered a device because you're actually doing analysis of the results of the test and coming up with a new output. So there are two pathways. There's an easier pathway and there's probably a very difficult pathway. One is to work with a given developer who already has a task and do the performance measurements and validation on that test for use with that test. And that can be - there are various pathways for that. If you're, you know, test developers themselves can submit everything, you know, and update their EUA potentially or you can stay independent. We can figure out how to do that basically which team writes better reference letters. And we would probably update both, you know, give the - your smartphone application that's on EUA and then we would also update the package insert of the test to say that it can be used with this device. If you wanted to have a more broad claim that would work on multiple platforms, multiple tests could be a little bit more challenging because there's obviously variability in those tests. And that would be fairly challenging given, you know, sometimes the reads are different, locations are different, colors are different, intensities are different.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: How can developers collaborate with test manufacturers to validate the use of a smartphone app for analyzing specific tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Developers can collaborate with test manufacturers by working with an existing test developer to validate their app for use with that test and update the EUA as needed. They can either rely on the test developer to submit updates or proceed independently. Broad claims involving multiple test platforms may require additional validation due to test variability.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How can developers collaborate with test manufacturers to validate the use of a smartphone app for analyzing specific tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: ...based on the - that device's analysis. So there are two pathways. There's an easier pathway and there's probably a very difficult pathway. One is to work NWX-FDA OC US with a given developer who already has a task and do the performance measurements and validation on that test for use with that test. And that can be - there are various pathways for that. If you're, you know, test developers themselves can submit everything, you know, and update their EUA potentially or you can stay independent. We can figure out how to do that basically which team writes better reference letters. And we would probably update both, you know, give the - your smartphone application that's on EUA and then we would also update the package insert of the test to say that it can be used with this device. If you wanted to have a more broad claim that would work on multiple platforms, multiple tests could be a little bit more challenging because there's obviously variability in those tests.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: When adding analytical capabilities to a smartphone app, how does it impact the regulatory classification or EUA process?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA considers a smartphone app with analytical capabilities a device if it analyzes test results to provide new outputs. Regulatory pathways include partnering with a test developer to validate results for specific use or independently pursuing EUA updates, which may involve test-specific or broader, multi-test claims. Broader claims are more challenging due to test variability.

#### 9. Challenges and Considerations in Saliva-Based Diagnostic Testing

QA Block 9-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Do you think maintaining the 95% PPA requirement for alternative respiratory specimens compared to NP swabs is a rigid rule in the context of using saliva-based massive testing?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Maintaining the 95% PPA requirement for saliva-based testing is considered critical to understand its performance and limitations. While FDA is open and flexible, any performance below 95% requires labeling negatives as presumed rather than confirmed. Alternative comparisons like mid-turbinate swabs are preferred if NP swabs are unavailable.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Do you think maintaining the 95% PPA requirement for alternative respiratory specimens compared to NP swabs is a rigid rule in the context of using saliva-based massive testing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Okay so we've found saliva to be an incredibly unpredictable when challenging substrate. I mean and we've really not ever considered testing saliva for a respiratory virus and authorized it before to my knowledge. This is incredibly unique, you know, and we're open and flexible and adaptable to different approaches. But we've seen and denied some saliva submissions because of performance. And we are aware of multiple developers who have just decided that saliva's too tough. Obviously there are advantages to saliva right, easy to collect. You don't need - you may not need transport media or if you do it's in a device that's easily used. And we've authorized tests with some devices already. And you don't need, you know, swabs. You don't need VTM per se. And so there are huge advantages to being able to use saliva. So we just ask the developers and if they want to - and saliva can be added to a EUA test without an FDA submission if it's an LDT. Obviously kit manufacturers they can - it's a notified pathway they can validate saliva, notify the FDA and in 15 business days submit their saliva EUA package. But for labs that want to either alter a kit or alter their own LDT, we don't NWX-FDA OC US require a EUA submission for that. And but we do ask that you validate it well. And we have come to believe that a comparison to NP swab is critical to understanding the performance and the performance limitations of saliva. And we don't - I don't think we acquire that much. I mean it's basically 30 positives. And we understand that nasal pharyngeal swabs are sometimes hard to obtain. A good second choice for an NP to saliva comparison would be a mid-terminate sample, mid-terminate swab sample. I think most students patients would much prefer to have a mid-terminate to an end - to a nasopharyngeal swab. So that is also acceptable to us right now. We are trying to discourage nasal swab to saliva because there is the potential for additional loss of sensitivity in the nasal swab. And we have found in many cases now that that comparison is not the best comparison to use going forward. So hopefully that helps.

VERBATIM QUESTION: In the notification pathway, can tests be distributed to healthcare workers at the point of care who are not high complexity CLIA lab personnel?
VERBATIM ANSWER: All of the tests that are being offered without or prior to EUA default to high complexity. And that's under the CLIA regulation.
