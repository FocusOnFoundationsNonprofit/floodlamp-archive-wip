I think we say typically within 24 hours but certainly, the shorter time period between those two samplings will be, you know, more quickly result in a higher agreement. It also depends on technology of your device itself. If you're doing your point of care lab test, I think there's a lot of variables that could be guiding the test design plan. And so I think, you know, just having more interaction with us specifically what you're trying to do would help. But certainly, I think in the EUA templates that that alternative respiratory specimen is the kind of section we want to look at.

QA Block 8-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Do we need to launch a full clinical study for patient saliva samples or can we use biobanked or borrowed samples from lab partners with confirmed positive and negative samples?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Validation of saliva sample testing can use biobanked samples, but factors like viral load range, frozen versus fresh samples, and stability (especially at room temperature) need to be considered. Refer to the EUA template's Alternate Specimens section for guidance.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Do we need to launch a full clinical study for patient saliva samples or can we use biobanked or borrowed samples from lab partners with confirmed positive and negative samples?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So there are recommendations for validation in the EUA template including the alternate specimen section. And I would see if Kris has anything to add about whether the other recommendations discuss using leftover samples. I think that is discussed there but I can't recall off the top of my head. Yes this is Kris. You know, I think the two important factors when you're talking about banked samples for saliva specifically or because they want to see a range of viral loads in that...specimen type is to make sure that you're able to detect, you know, accurately FDA Townhall across the entire range so especially close to the cut off. And the other question I think we would be asking would be fresh versus frozen study...to ensure that that freezing is not enhancing or detracting from the performance of your assay. But I think as Toby mentioned there are some additional recommendations in the template as well. You know, I think our - the data on saliva is evolving and, you know, the saliva certainly is a complex matrix. So instability is a very important parameter to establish this. So I mean any kind of recommendations given. to your users about sample stability storage, anything like that should certainly be tested and, you know, that even goes more so for saliva. And just to for clarity the section that's titled Alternate Specimens or something like, that Validation for Alternate Specimens is what would be applicable to saliva.

#### 12. Clarifying FDA Guidelines for Antigen and Molecular Testing Templates

QA Block 12-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: When is the right time to use the original antigen template versus the new template for point-of-care versus non-laboratory settings?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The appropriate template depends on whether the environment qualifies as a laboratory under CLIA. Point-of-care generally refers to CLIA-certified laboratory settings, while non-laboratory environments like homes, schools without CLIA waivers, and other workplaces use the new template.
VERBATIM QUESTION: When is the right time to use the original antigen template versus the new template for point-of-care versus non-laboratory settings?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Sure absolutely So generally when we refer to point of care we are still referring to a laboratory environment. Facilities that are - that operate under a CLIA certificate of waiver that we often refer to colloquially as a CLIA waived environment...are considered laboratories by CLIA. So when we refer to a non-laboratory environment we're referring to a home environment or, you know, a school that does not have, you know, a CLIA Certificate of Waiver. We know that some physicians' offices have CLIA certificates of waiver so they can operate devices that are authorized for use in such environments.

VERBATIM ANSWER: We know that some physicians' offices have CLIA certificates of waiver so they can operate devices that are authorized for use in such environments. But some physicians' offices may not have any CLIA waiver at all. And then FDA Townhall they would be considered a non-laboratory environment. Same with workplaces, airports -- things like that.

QA Block 12-12
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are there different regulatory expectations for facilities with and without a CLIA Certificate of Waiver?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Facilities with a CLIA Certificate of Waiver are considered laboratories, while non-laboratory environments (e.g., homes, schools without waivers, workplaces, airports) operate without such certifications and are regulated differently.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are there different regulatory expectations for facilities with and without a CLIA Certificate of Waiver?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So generally when we refer to point of care we are still referring to a laboratory environment. Facilities that are - that operate under a CLIA certificate of waiver that we often refer to colloquially as a CLIA waived environment...are considered laboratories by CLIA. So when we refer to a non-laboratory environment we're referring to a home environment or, you know, a school that does not have, you know, a CLIA Certificate of Waiver. We know that some physicians' offices have CLIA certificates of waiver so they can operate devices that are authorized for use in such environments. But some physicians' offices may not have any CLIA waiver at all. And then FDA Townhall they would be considered a non-laboratory environment. Same with workplaces, airports -- things like that.

#### 13. Data Requirements for Adding Pooling to EUA Assay

QA Block 13-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Would you need to see all the single analyte data in the amendment to the EUA or just the pooled data?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: For an amendment to add pooling to a previously authorized EUA, the amendment should include the pooling data but does not need to revalidate individual samples since the single analyte data has already been reviewed.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Would you need to see all the single analyte data in the amendment to the EUA or just the pooled data?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So you said you're adding using adding pooling to an already authorized assay? Okay so there are recommendations in the guidance for that particular situation or sorry, in the template. And that includes the data that we would expect to see as well as how we would want to present it. So we wouldn't necessarily expect you to revalidate it for the individual examples but we would be looking at, you know, for some data that shows that you're not dropping too much sensitivity and that you've established your CT shift when validating pooling. And Kris do you want to add anything to that? Yes this is Kris. So I would just say there are different data requirements for assays that have previous EUA versus those that don't. So you've kind of already established your sensitivity specificity and the next piece is going to be just establishing that performance for pooling. So, you know, the amendment should just need to include the pooling data because you're going to have all the rest of the data with us previously reviewed from your EUA.
