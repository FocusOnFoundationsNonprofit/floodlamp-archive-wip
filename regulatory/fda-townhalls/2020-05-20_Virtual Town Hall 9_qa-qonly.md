#### 1. FDA Updates on COVID-19 Diagnostic Testing Strategies

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the FDA have a recommendation to use IgG, IgM, IgA combined tests or a total test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA does not have a specific position on using IgG, IgM, IgA combined tests or a total test. Tests are evaluated and authorized based on meeting performance criteria, and users can decide which to use based on performance characteristics.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA have a recommendation to use IgG, IgM, IgA combined tests or a total test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The agency really doesn't have a position on which of these isotypes is most important. We will evaluate and authorize tests that if performed minimally expected performance criteria as set forth in the templates for serology. And we make sure that those performance characteristics are known, and users of these tests can make their own decision as far as that goes.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Serology tests, IgG/IgM/IgA testing, FDA recommendations
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Where can information about serology guidance, NCI testing results, and the serology tests calculator be found?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Information on serology guidance, NCI testing results, and the serology calculator can be found on the FDA's serology performance web page. A link to the Negative and Positive Predictive Value calculator is provided there, along with supporting documentation like NCI results and guidance documents.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Where can information about serology guidance, NCI testing results, and the serology tests calculator be found?
VERBATIM ANSWER: On the slide presentation today, we've given all of the important FDA links including where you can find serology guidance, where you can find NCI testing results, where you can find the calculator for serology tests. So, we do provide an NPV, or Negative Predictive Value, and Positive Predictive Value calculator on our serology performance page. There's a link to that calculator. You can either look at the performance with one test or if you use the two-test strategy on a second serology test that is different from the first it can potentially have a good impact on increasing the positive predictive value and we provide a calculator there that does theoretical considerations for a two-test strategy. The NCI documentation is also on that serology performance page. The FDA guidance documents are present on one of those pages.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: serology guidance, NCI testing results, serology test calculator

QA Block 1-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How reliable is the recently authorized direct antigen test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The recently authorized direct antigen test met the FDA's minimum sensitivity standard of 80% during evaluation. It demonstrated detection in four out of five positives (80%) and is undergoing further post-market studies.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How reliable is the recently authorized direct antigen test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The performance as evaluated in the EUA authorization is listed in our EUA authorization page in the instructions for use, within a link for that product. So, you can look at how it compares to PCR and again, our minimum criteria for any diagnostic test such as this is at least 80 percent sensitivity which that test was able to achieve. They had a minimum of 30 positive results on actual patient samples. So, we were able to authorize the test based on that. We also had preliminary information on direct swab results and, again, we were able to detect four out of five positives. They are continuing to do a study. They had authorization post-market to be able to do that. As soon as that study is complete, we'll update package insert with the performance on direct swabs. And as long as that achieves 80 percent or more sensitivity relative to a high sensitivity PCR test, that sample type will be able to remain with that test.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Direct antigen test reliability, EUA sensitivity standards, Post-market studies
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How do the results of the direct antigen test compare to PCR?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Direct antigen tests must achieve at least 80% sensitivity compared to PCR to be authorized. Preliminary data showed they detected four out of five positives, and further studies are ongoing to update performance data.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How do the results of the direct antigen test compare to PCR?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The performance as evaluated in the EUA authorization is listed in our EUA authorization page in the instructions for use, within a link for that product.

QA Block 1-5
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can the direct antigen test significantly ramp up testing capabilities?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA confirms that direct antigen tests can significantly increase testing capacity, potentially producing millions of tests, though users should consider their lower sensitivity compared to central lab molecular tests.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can the direct antigen test significantly ramp up testing capabilities?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We think that there is a role for this. I forgot to mention that the direct antigen tests do have the opportunity to be produced in great numbers in the quantities of millions of tests. So, there is the opportunity to make more testing available using a direct antigen test than perhaps other direct tests for the virus. However, its performance limitations would be remembered as far as the sensitivity relative to a central lab molecular result.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Direct antigen test, Testing capacity, Performance limitations
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-6
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are self-collected nasal swabs adequate if unobserved?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Yes, the FDA believes self-collected nasal swabs are adequate without observation for sufficient performance.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are self-collected nasal swabs adequate if unobserved?
VERBATIM ANSWER: And yes, we have authorized, in fact, now more than one home collection of nasal swabs and we believe that does not need to be observed to get adequate performance.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Self-collected nasal swabs, Home collection, Test performance
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-7
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Where does an EUA approved antigen test fit into the testing strategy?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: EUA-approved antigen tests play a role in testing strategies due to their potential for mass production, enabling large-scale testing. However, users must consider their lower sensitivity compared to central lab molecular tests.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Where does an EUA approved antigen test fit into the testing strategy?

QA Block 1-8
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What tests can be used for screening asymptomatic individuals and making return to work decisions?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA allows the use of EUA-authorized tests for asymptomatic individuals if ordered by a physician or clinician. However, the performance in such populations is not well-established. Developers interested in making claims for asymptomatic testing should work with FDA on proper study designs for authorization.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What tests can be used for screening asymptomatic individuals and making return to work decisions?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So, on our Frequently Asked Questions page, we do address the testing of asymptomatic individuals and currently all our EUAs authorizations are prescription and so as long as the physician or clinician has ordered a test and it happens to be on a patient without symptoms, as long as an EUA authorized test is used that is okay by us. We don't know the performance in the asymptomatic population. There are a number of developers who we're working with and who are interested in this and then if a developer of a kit would like to claim or a lab would like to claim performance characteristics around asymptomatic individuals, we would ask that they approach us with study designs so that we can work with them and we can find a way to authorize such tests.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE

QA Block 1-11
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What steps should a developer take to update the instructions for use for an already authorized diagnostic test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Developers should review data, collaborate with the FDA, and address identified issues such as sensitivity by updating the instructions for use and intended use limitations as needed.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What steps should a developer take to update the instructions for use for an already authorized diagnostic test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Weeks ago, we updated the instructions for use to remove VTM due to potential delusional effects that may have impacted the sensitivity of the Abbott ID NOW Test. More recently, we have seen reports and we have preliminary data, that's now public, that suggests there may be a decrease in sensitivity at the very low end with the Abbott ID NOW. And we just wanted to make that publicly known. We've worked collaboratively with Abbott to adjust as we go along here and we're in the process of updating the instructions for use and the intended use limitations to convert a negative result with the Abbott ID NOW to a presumed negative result.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Updating instructions for use, Abbott ID NOW test sensitivity
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-12
CLARIFIED QUESTION: When should negative results on certain tests be considered presumptive and require confirmation through a different molecular test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Negative results from the Abbott ID NOW test should be considered presumptive if clinical features suggest the results may not be accurate. In such cases, the FDA recommends confirming with another molecular test.
VERBATIM QUESTION: When should negative results on certain tests be considered presumptive and require confirmation through a different molecular test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We've worked collaboratively with Abbott to adjust as we go along here and we're in the process of updating the instructions for use and the intended use limitations to convert a negative result with the Abbott ID NOW to a presumed negative result. And what this means is that if there are clinical features, indications that suggest that the negative result from an Abbott ID NOW test may not be a true negative. That the agency recommends reflux to another molecular test for confirmation of that negative.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Abbott ID NOW negative results, Molecular test confirmation, Diagnostic testing adjustments
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-13
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What constitutes the minimal thresholds for sensitivity for various types of diagnostic tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Minimal sensitivity thresholds for point-of-care tests, such as those detecting antigens or nucleic acids, should be at least 80% to play a significant role, particularly in patient triaging during COVID-19.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What constitutes the minimal thresholds for sensitivity for various types of diagnostic tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The agency believes that as long as certain minimal thresholds for sensitivity for a diagnostic test are achieved that they may play a role and that there are different roles potentially for different diagnostics. Point of care diagnostics. For example, that detect either the protein antigen or are, in fact, nucleic acids, if they return a result very quickly, could play a role in this pandemic, an important role. Especially if that positive result can be relied upon that is the specificity is very high. And so as long as the minimal threshold for a point of care direct detection test is at least sensitivity of 80 percent. We believe that knowing this and knowing the true performance of such a point of care test and knowing that it may be less sensitive than a central ab molecular test is important but also can play a role in triaging patients who are suspected of having COVID-19.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Sensitivity thresholds, Point-of-care tests, COVID-19 diagnostics
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-14
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How crucial is specificity for point-of-care direct detection diagnostic tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA views high specificity in point-of-care tests as crucial, especially when the sensitivity meets a minimum threshold of 80%, to ensure reliable rapid detection plays a pivotal role in triaging suspected COVID-19 cases.
VERBATIM QUESTION: IMPLICIT
VERBATIM ANSWER: Point of care diagnostics that detect either protein antigens or nucleic acids and return results quickly can play an important role in the pandemic, especially if the specificity is very high. The FDA believes that as long as the minimal threshold for sensitivity for a diagnostic test is at least 80%, such a test can still be valuable. It is important to know the true performance of these point-of-care tests, as they may be less sensitive than central molecular lab tests, but they can be used effectively to triage suspected COVID-19 patients.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Point-of-care diagnostics specificity, COVID-19 testing criteria, Sensitivity threshold
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-15
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What factors are evaluated when considering the role of a test with sensitivity lower than central lab molecular tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA considers tests with a sensitivity of at least 80% and high specificity as valuable for certain roles, like triaging suspected COVID-19 patients, even if they are less sensitive than central lab molecular tests.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What factors are evaluated when considering the role of a test with sensitivity lower than central lab molecular tests?

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What study endpoints should be considered when conducting post-market performance evaluations of diagnostic tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: For post-market performance evaluations of diagnostic tests, the FDA emphasizes endpoints that determine the sensitivity of the assay, requiring at least 80% sensitivity in controlled trial circumstances.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What study endpoints should be considered when conducting post-market performance evaluations of diagnostic tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Abbott has agreed to perform a number of post-market studies and also initiate a new one which we're negotiating what those end points will be for that study. If we are able to determine that sensitivity of the assay in controlled trial circumstances is at least 80 percent, we feel like that test has a valuable place going forward in this pandemic.

QA Block 1-17
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What performance criteria are required for the use of saliva as a sample type in COVID-19 testing?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA has updated molecular and direct antigen templates to include saliva, providing guidance for validation studies. Saliva is authorized for physician-observed and home collection but shows variable performance. Despite challenges, it is considered an adequate sample for COVID-19 testing.
VERBATIM QUESTION: IMPLICIT
VERBATIM ANSWER: We did update our molecular and direct antigen templates with saliva. We have recommended studies for going ahead and validating and determining performance for saliva in those templates. We have obviously authorized Rutgers for both physician or clinician observed saliva collection as well as now home collection. Saliva is an interesting sample type. It's obviously something that doesn't require a swab. It's easy for a patient to do themselves. So, that is an interesting sample type. We continue to see some variable performance using saliva. I can point you to now posted publication of the United Health Group Gates Funded Study. Looking at oral secretion. Where there was a variable comparative performance when you look at cycle threshold on a PCR assay. There was basically no correlation between oral fluid and an MP swab as the gold standard comparative for that study. It doesn't mean that saliva isn't a potentially good substitute for detection of the virus. It just means that there is potential variables that we don't yet understand. And as long as overall performance is good, saliva, we believe, is an adequate substrate to perform testing on.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Saliva as sample type, COVID-19 testing criteria
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-18
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What challenges exist in using saliva as a substitute for nasopharyngeal swabs?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Saliva, while easy to collect and potentially a good substitute for nasopharyngeal swabs, shows variable performance and lacks consistent correlation with PCR results compared to the gold-standard MP swabs.

QA Block 1-20
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How does a test become categorized under high complexity, moderate complexity, or CLIA-waived, and where is this information published?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Tests are automatically categorized as high complexity if not reviewed by the FDA. Authorization for moderate complexity or CLIA-waived tests is stated in the authorization and published on the FDA website, where the designations 'H', 'M', or 'W' indicate the complexity level.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How does a test become categorized under high complexity, moderate complexity, or CLIA-waived, and where is this information published?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The question has to do with the CLIA complexity. In those situations where the agency hasn't reviewed, those are automatically in a high complexity category. The high complexity lab does have a point of care station. They can use these tests within their high complexity CLIA lab. When we make an authorization for a moderately complex and/or CLIA wave we will make that information known in the authorization and also clearly post that information on our FDA website links where we designate either H for high complexity, M for moderate complexity or W for CLIA waved. In those cases where a test has been designated the CLIA wave, it can be used in the point of care in your patient setting as long as that setting is covered by a CLIA certificate.

#### 2. Future FDA Pathways for SARS-CoV-2 Test Submissions

QA Block 2-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Will FDA issue guidance on the requirements for 510k submissions for serology tests post-EUA?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA plans to issue a special controls document outlining requirements for transitioning serology tests to 510k clearance post-EUA after an initial de novo application. Requirements will align with standards for other respiratory virus diagnostics and be supported through a pre-submission process.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Will FDA issue guidance on the requirements for 510k submissions for serology tests post-EUA?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The first application for serology or direct antigen or a molecular test for SARS-CoV-2 detection or detection of antibodies directed at that will defacto be a de novo application. And then we will, as we have in the past for something novel, we will write a document that's called a special controls document that outlines the considerations that allow for the down classification to a 510k for all subsequent. The special controls document just outlines those expectations for development and validation and other factors that mitigate the risks and allow all subsequent submissions to be 510k. That's the expected pathway for all . We certainly welcome anyone who wants to come forward, any developers who want to come forward now and get the first one being a de novo grant and subsequent 510k clearances. As far as what will be required for that, it's going to be largely the same that we would for any other serology directed at a respiratory virus or a direct detection technology for a respiratory virus.

And then we will, as we have in the past for something novel, we will write a document that's called a special controls document that outlines the considerations that allow for the down classification to a 510k for all subsequent. The special controls document just outlines those expectations for development and validation and other factors that mitigate the risks and allow all subsequent submissions to be 510k. That's the expected pathway for all . We certainly welcome anyone who wants to come forward, any developers who want to come forward now and get the first one being a de novo grant and subsequent 510k clearances. As far as what will be required for that, it's going to be largely the same that we would for any other serology directed at a respiratory virus or a direct detection technology for a respiratory virus. And we'll work with anyone with that through the pre-submission two-step process.

#### 7. Validation of Dry Swabs for At-Home COVID-19 Testing

QA Block 7-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Would the agency accept dry swabs collected from SARS-CoV-2 negative participants spiked with VTM or UTM as positive samples?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA suggests that validation of the resuspension of a dry swab with your assay is key. Most other required work is likely completed, and prior stability study data can be referenced. It appears individual positive patient samples may not be needed, but the FDA recommends confirming this.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Would the agency accept dry swabs collected from SARS-CoV-2 negative participants spiked with VTM or UTM as positive samples?
VERBATIM ANSWER: I believe what is the – sort of the only piece that might be missing from this is validation of resuspension of a dry swab with your particular assay or assays that you want to use with this, but much of the rest of the work has already been accomplished, and rights are allowed to the previous data that Toby mentioned about stability. So I think there's a pretty clear pathway that is least burdensome here and pretty efficient. I think, if I remember correctly, we just want to make sure from the dry swab you have a good method of resuspending and it performs well in your hands, and at that point, coming off the swab in that situation, I don't believe actual patient positives – individual, you know, positive patients aren't needed for that, but let's double-check on that, okay?

#### 8. Criteria for Moderate Complexity in Serology Testing

QA Block 8-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What specific methodology and data are you looking at to provide a moderate complexity designation for serology IgG IgM lateral flow devices?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: To assign a moderate complexity designation to serology IgG IgM lateral flow tests, the FDA requires EUA authorization and assesses whether the test needs highly trained personnel. Such tests are generally suitable for moderately complex environments and do not necessarily require user studies, as they are conducted in lab settings with trained professionals.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What specific methodology and data are you looking at to provide a moderate complexity designation for serology IgG IgM lateral flow devices?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Okay. Yeah, so in order to get the moderately complex designation, it does need to be EUA-authorized. That is an assessment that is done by the team in regards whether it requires highly trained technologists to perform that testing. For example, a rapid lateral flow serology test in almost all cases would be amenable to a moderately-complex environment. Whether or not it then also qualifies for waived status being status or, you know, sort of point-of-care does require different amounts of information, but as far as the moderately complex, it does not, in and of itself, require user studies or anything like that, because it's being performed within a lab environment that does have lab-trained professionals.

VERBATIM ANSWER: Okay. Yeah, so in order to get the moderately complex designation, it does need to be EUA-authorized. That is an assessment that is done by the team in regards whether it requires highly trained technologists to perform that testing. For example, a rapid lateral flow serology test in almost all cases would be amenable to a moderately-complex environment. Whether or not it then also qualifies for waived status being status or, you know, sort of point-of-care does require different amounts of information, but as far as the moderately complex, it does not, in and of itself, require user studies or anything like that, because it's being performed within a lab environment that does have lab-trained professionals.

#### 12. Prescription-Only Tests: Risks and Mitigation Strategies

QA Block 12-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is the prescription-only status for home collection without observation being maintained to protect the supply, or has consideration been given to waiving that requirement?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The prescription-only status for home collection tests is in place to mitigate risks, especially when clinicians handle test orders and interpretation. FDA is open to non-prescription options but requires risk mitigation strategies and evaluation specific to the technology. Developers can contact FDA to discuss alternatives.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is the prescription-only status for home collection without observation being maintained to protect the supply, or has consideration been given to waiving that requirement?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So – I'll take a stab at this. You know, the current tests are being authorized through Rx only, prescription, and that allows us some degree of mitigation of risks. When a clinician or an order – health-care professional order isn't plausible, the risks of false negatives or false positives for whatever kind of tests are mitigated when a health-care provider is involved and ordering and interpreting and explaining and determining, say, medical decisions being made off that testing. So we're totally open to different options. Under the streamline EUA where we really required very minimal validation to rapidly expand testing, that was one of the mitigations we looked into. So if a developer wants to look into a different situation where a health-care provider is not involved that – we just want to look at how we mitigate any potential risks, and so that would be highly dependent on your technology. These use – they use an interpretation the clear – when you have, you know, we understand their test results, it's clear to somebody what we would do with those results and how it impacts your healthcare. So that's a great conversation to have, and it's going to depend a lot on the specifics, so reach out to the template's email address for that.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Why or when will the Zhejiang Orient Gene Biotech test kit from AYTU Bioscience be approved?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So, we've obviously updated our guidance on serology tests recently and…put into place processes and procedures. So, you should expect that in the very near future that decisions will be rolling off and that we'll make those decisions public. You know, the original, let's see, March 16th guidance allowed tests of this sort if they met the criteria that was set forth in the guidance to notify us. We would post that notification and to be legally marketed. We're meeting the public health need at that time. And now the update is for us to review those applications and make decisions.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Do you think there's value in developing highly automated antigen tests for central laboratory use?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA welcomes technology that assists in the pandemic. While automated antigen tests may offer higher throughput and lower costs, they are likely less sensitive than central lab molecular tests. FDA remains open for discussions about development.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Do you think there's value in developing highly automated antigen tests for central laboratory use?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Certainly, you know, performances adequate. We welcome all assistance in this pandemic. The public health need isn't just for me or our office to figure out. I'm just thinking through the benefits of such technology. There may be higher throughput potentially. There may be lower costs. But there is the trade-off on sensitivity most likely. It's unlikely that it would be as sensitive as a central lab molecular test. So that's the trade-off. So, I wouldn't say no. And if it's something that you want or others want to develop, we would be interested in having a conversation with you.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the specific elements that allowed the designation of moderate complexity for serology IgG IgM lateral flow devices?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: To designate serology IgG IgM lateral flow devices as moderately complex, the test must be EUA-authorized and does not typically require user studies since it is assumed to be conducted in labs by trained professionals. Such tests generally suit moderately complex environments unless waived criteria for point-of-care use are met.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the specific elements that allowed the designation of moderate complexity for serology IgG IgM lateral flow devices?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Okay. Yeah, so in order to get the moderately complex designation, it does need to be EUA-authorized. That is an assessment that is done by the team in regards whether it requires highly trained technologists to perform that testing. For example, a rapid lateral flow serology test in almost all cases would be amenable to a moderately-complex environment. Whether or not it then also qualifies for waived status being status or, you know, sort of point-of-care does require different amounts of information, but as far as the moderately complex, it does not, in and of itself, require user studies or anything like that, because it's being performed within a lab environment that does have lab-trained professionals.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What validation data is required to demonstrate the performance of COVID-19 tests for asymptomatic individuals?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA states that validation for asymptomatic testing requires performance data like sensitivity and specificity for asymptomatic individuals, which remains an evolving science. Developers must perform appropriate validations to ensure safety and specificity. Meanwhile, FDA does not object to using legally authorized tests for asymptomatic scenarios.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What validation data is required to demonstrate the performance of COVID-19 tests for asymptomatic individuals?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So we're very open to working with developers to achieve that ability to put that in the intended use, but right now the actual performance of tests on asymptomatic – you know, the sensitivity specificity in the setting of an asymptomatic individual, that's an evolving science, and we don't know exactly what the true performance characteristic are in that population. So the appropriate validations would need to be done in order to show that testing's safe in that environment for that specific claim that a developer would make. But in the intervening period – and we're working with developers on this. In the intervening period, we are not objecting to use of testing in that situations. Using legally-authorized test, we can do that.
