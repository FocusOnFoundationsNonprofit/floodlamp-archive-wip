REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How is the FDA facilitating testing for monkeypox (MPV) through clinical reference labs?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is increasing monkeypox testing by working with five major clinical reference labs—LabCorp, Mayo, Quest, Aegis, and Sonic—to expand testing capacity using the FDA-cleared CDC NVO kit. These labs are ramping up to at least 10,000 tests per week each, increasing U.S. capacity to 60,000 tests weekly.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How is the FDA facilitating testing for monkeypox (MPV) through clinical reference labs?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The FDA has been working early and hard to increase the availability and testing throughout‐‐ and throughput‐‐ of the FDA cleared CDC NVO kit. That kit was cleared many years ago and has been used in and scores of the public health labs around the country. The number is steadily increasing and is around 80 labs right now. We're also expanding that testing into five major clinical reference labs. So the kits have already been made available to these five labs as of last week. And they're preparing to set up testing in their labs. And currently, the public health labs throughput per week is about 10,000 tests per week with the addition of the five major reference labs. And this is LabCorp, Mayo, Quest, Aegis, and Sonic. They volunteered among the large reference labs to proceed with this. And we expect that, eventually, over the next coming weeks, that they'll each be able to ramp up to a capacity of at least 10,000 tests per week. So that does take us to about 60,000 tests per week in the U.S.

#### 3. Throat Swabs for COVID-19 Testing: FDA's Current Stance

QA Block 3-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Has there been any further research to validate throat swabs for at-home COVID-19 diagnostic tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Research has been conducted on throat swabs, but most evidence does not support their use, and the FDA has not authorized it. Throat swabs should only be collected by trained healthcare providers, and nasal swabs remain the recommended option for most COVID-19 tests. The FDA is open to throat swabs if adequate safety and performance data are provided.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Has there been any further research to validate throat swabs for at-home COVID-19 diagnostic tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, there has been some research. And unfortunately, the preponderance of evidence does not support adding this, in general. We have not authorized it. But I'll go on to say that we're open to it. I would like to add that the CDC still recommends that throat swabs be collected only by trained health care provider. I'd also like to note that the NIH RADx program has assessed throat swabs for COVID, particularly for antigen tests, and the data did not support the addition of throat swabs. So as I said, the FDA is open to the possibility of self‐collected throat swabs, or physician, or health care worker collected throat swabs for rapid tests‐‐ molecular and antigen, or even central lab tests‐‐ if there is sufficient data demonstrating that the safety concerns have been addressed and that the swabs perform adequately according to our expectations of performance. But we have not seen this yet. And as I said, there is this evidence that it doesn't appear that the benefits‐‐ potential benefits‐‐ would outweigh the potential risks, particularly for self‐collection. But again, we're open to it. So the FDA currently still believes that the nasal swabs likely remain the best option for most tests and developers that adequately mitigate some of the risks. And we do encourage developers continue to validate nasal swabs along with any other sample type that they are interested in pursuing. So if they're interested in pursuing a throat swab, then we would still recommend‐‐ to mitigate your development risk‐‐ that you include nasal swabs in your study.

#### 6. FDA Reporting Requirements for OTC Molecular Test Results

QA Block 6-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: When does the FDA require automatic test result reporting for molecular over-the-counter (OTC) tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA generally includes a condition of authorization for OTC tests requiring a diagnostic data capture and transmission solution for reporting results to public health authorities. This may involve automated or digital solutions, sometimes included post-authorization.
VERBATIM QUESTION: When does the FDA require automatic test result reporting for molecular over-the-counter (OTC) tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So for over‐the‐counter test, we do typically include a condition of authorization that requires developers to provide a diagnostic data capture and transmission solution to facilitate reporting of results to public health authorities and health care providers. The EUA can be issued without that reporting solution having been implemented, and that's when it would be included in a post‐authorization condition. And so generally, we work directly with each sponsor on how to best accomplish this, which may include automation of data capture and transmission, digital interpretation or reading of test results‐‐ which would be accomplished using software as a medical device‐‐ or digital health tools that reduce the user burden with regard to data collection.

#### 9. Decreased Sensitivity of Antigen Tests and Low Positives

QA Block 9-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is the decreased sensitivity of the omicron antigen test due to a higher percentage of low positives or N protein mutations causing this?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The decreased sensitivity is linked to a higher percentage of low positives, which rose from 10–20% to 30–40%, challenging antigen tests greatly. However, the exact reasons behind this are unclear, and ongoing research explores other mechanisms, such as lower anti-protein levels relative to RNA in the virus.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is the decreased sensitivity of the omicron antigen test due to a higher percentage of low positives or N protein mutations causing this?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We have seen a huge increase in the percent of low positives in taking and seeing all the data and clinical studies from even towards the end of last year compared to the beginning of this year. So instead of seeing the usual 10% to 20% low positives that we had been seeing in typical studies prior to the end of last year, which reflects our template recommendations for low positives, we saw a jump to 30% to 40% low positives. And the higher the CTs go, the less likely antigen tests are going to be positive. And so when you have 40% low positives in areas that really challenge antigen tests, then you're going to see a really big hit in sensitivity. Basically, it could be down to 60% sensitivity for antigen tests for a single test in symptomatic patients. And we know that it's even more challenging for antigen tests to detect asymptomatic patients. So that performance is even lower than that. And it's why many of the recent authorizations have prescribed serial testing for symptomatic individuals and continued serial testing for asymptomatic individuals, as well. It's important to note that, now, what's actually driving that is less clear. I don't think we have enough data to say it. Some of the early data we looked at‐‐ vaccination status and potentially previous infection status, and that didn't necessarily reflect that. So there could be other‐‐ there's continuing research into some of the other mechanisms for the lower sensitivity. Some of the hypothesis out there is a lower anti‐protein per‐‐ as the ratio of the RNA present in the virus. And perhaps that changes through the natural history of an infection. And at the time when you want to perform an antigen test, there may be an under‐abundance of anti‐protein in the viral sample compared to RNA. Anyway, lots of questions, not as many answers, but clear observation of a significant increase in the number of low positives.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What should a developer do if their submitted test sensitivity is too low and doesn't meet the recommendation template?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Developers should submit all their data even if test sensitivity is lower than the template recommendation. FDA will use modeling to assess equivalence with prior reviews and consider the entirety of the data set to determine test performance.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What should a developer do if their submitted test sensitivity is too low and doesn't meet the recommendation template?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah. Well, if you look at some of our recent authorizations, you'll see that we do modeling to look at what is the performance down to, say, only 10% low positive.

Developers should submit all their data for analysis, including when facing 30%-40% low positives. Adjustments in review processes aim for consistency across years.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How is the FDA ensuring consistency in test performance reviews compared to prior years when low positive percentages were lower?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah. Well, if you look at some of our recent authorizations, you'll see that we do modeling to look at what is the performance down to, say, only 10% low positive. And we've provided some instructions on how to consider that. We just‐‐ I think it's probably worthwhile, if you have observed a high percentage of low positives that you go ahead and submit all your data. We don't want to see just the first 10% of low positives in your data set. We want to look at the whole data set. And we'll examine it and see if some of our work in modeling can't adjust for this. Because we're basically trying to make reviews this year equivalent to reviews that we did last year when there were only 10% to 20% low positives. We think very likely, if not with great certainty, that tests that we authorized prior to this year‐‐ antigen tests‐‐ if they faced 30% to 40% low positives, they would probably be subject to the same challenges. And so we are trying to use modeling to match performance as we saw last year and as we expect this year for otherwise good tests. It's challenging. And it is one of the reasons why it's taking a little bit longer, now, to review antigen test applications.

REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 9-8
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the potential mechanisms being investigated for lower antigen test sensitivity, beyond vaccination and previous infection status?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is investigating mechanisms for lower antigen test sensitivity, noting an increase in low positive results, particularly as CT values rise. Hypotheses include a lower presence of anti-protein relative to RNA changes during infection. However, the exact cause remains unclear and under study.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the potential mechanisms being investigated for lower antigen test sensitivity, beyond vaccination and previous infection status?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We have seen a huge increase in the percent of low positives in taking and seeing all the data and clinical studies from even towards the end of last year compared to the beginning of this year. So instead of seeing the usual 10% to 20% low positives that we had been seeing in typical studies prior to the end of last year, which reflects our template recommendations for low positives, we saw a jump to 30% to 40% low positives. And the higher the CTs go, the less likely antigen tests are going to be positive. And so when you have 40% low positives in areas that really challenge antigen tests, then you're going to see a really big hit in sensitivity. Basically, it could be down to 60% sensitivity for antigen tests for a single test in symptomatic patients. And we know that it's even more challenging for antigen tests to detect asymptomatic patients. So that performance is even lower than that. And it's why many of the recent authorizations have prescribed serial testing for symptomatic individuals and continued serial testing for asymptomatic individuals, as well. It's important to note that, now, what's actually driving that is less clear. I don't think we have enough data to say it. Some of the early data we looked at‐‐ vaccination status and potentially previous infection status, and that didn't necessarily reflect that. So there could be other‐‐ there's continuing research into some of the other mechanisms for the lower sensitivity. Some of the hypothesis out there is a lower anti‐protein per‐‐ as the ratio of the RNA present in the virus. And perhaps that changes through the natural history of an infection. And at the time when you want to perform an antigen test, there may be an under‐abundance of anti‐protein in the viral sample compared to RNA. Anyway, lots of questions, not as many answers, but clear observation of a significant increase in the number of low positives.

#### 10. Selecting High-Sensitivity RT-PCR Comparator for FDA Authorization

QA Block 10-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the current sensitivity threshold in NDU per mL considered appropriate for a high-sensitivity RT-PCR comparator method?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends contacting its review staff or using the templates email to verify if a chosen test is an appropriate high-sensitivity comparator. NDUs are considered among other factors, including validation with actual patient samples. No fixed sensitivity threshold is publicly available.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the current sensitivity threshold in NDU per mL considered appropriate for a high-sensitivity RT-PCR comparator method?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah, the best way to determine whether or not the test you've chosen is an appropriate comparator is to reach out to the FDA review staff or go through the templates email to ask if the test that you're thinking about using is an appropriate high sensitivity comparator. We do use a combination of criteria to assess and determine whether a test is high sensitivity or not. The NDUs are one input, but they're not the sole input. We also consider tests that have‐‐ molecular tests‐‐ that have been validated on actual patient samples versus only contrived samples. So we still have some tests on the market that didn't use actual patient samples for their validation. So it's not a straight, cut‐and‐dry answer. And therefore, we haven't posted that information. Plus, we always want to reserve the right to adjust that as needed and as new information becomes available. We have very limited data for most of the EUA‐authorized tests. We don't have the full clinical study data that we would expect for a full authorization for most of the tests. Therefore, we are faced with difficult decisions on deciding just which tests are the very most high sensitivity. But the FDA staff can assist you in making sure that you make the correct selection. That's important because if you don't make the correct selection, we may not be able to use the clinical study data that you generate to make an authorization decision. And that's also another reason why we strongly recommend banking residual material, if possible, from the comparator test collection so that if additional testing on those bank samples could be helpful to a successful submission, you have those ready to be used.

#### 11. Challenges and Advances in Asymptomatic COVID-19 Screening Studies

QA Block 11-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: As requirements for COVID testing evidence loosen and the need for asymptomatic testing decreases, has the FDA been open to clinical studies incorporating callback or enrichment studies to help reach asymptomatic endpoints?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA remains supportive of asymptomatic screening despite challenges in conducting studies. They are open to enrichment methods for clinical studies, particularly for asymptomatic populations, to ensure accurate test performance data. They emphasize reducing bias and understanding public health impacts.
VERBATIM QUESTION: As requirements for COVID testing evidence loosen and the need for asymptomatic testing decreases, has the FDA been open to clinical studies incorporating callback or enrichment studies to help reach asymptomatic endpoints?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah. So I mean, to do an asymptomatic study now or in the past‐‐ I mean, we're still seeing a lot of disease. And we know there's asymptomatic spread. It may, with vaccination and previous infection, it may be increased. We don't know, with asymptomatic spread, what the level it's really occurring at. I would say that asymptomatic screening is still an important tool for our public health response. The FDA is totally supportive of that. And we do, at the same time, we do realize the challenges of performing an asymptomatic clinical study. And so I'll answer your question specifically first, but then I'll also relay some work that has been long in the making‐‐ a collaboration between the FDA, NIH, and the University of Massachusetts. So we are open to methods of enriching for certain populations when a situation either is demonstrated is challenging to complete the study without enrichment, and in particular, with asymptomatics it is, if you're doing your own study, it can be very challenging. We've crunched the numbers all which ways, depending on prevalence of symptomatic disease or at least test positivity, and the study designs can be quite large and quite challenging to perform, let alone the costs involved in doing those studies. One of the estimates was that we might need‐‐ a developer might need 10,000 patients in a study to get 20 positives. And it's probably lower than that now, but I doubt it's lower than 4,000 or 5,000 patients to get 20 positive asymptomatics. So that's just the challenge. And so we've always been open, in the asymptomatic studies, to enrichment. It is important to do it in a way that mitigates and limits bias so that we do have a good understanding of the actual performance of the test and that it isn't biased in a way that would alter our understanding of the performance and, therefore, the understanding of potential users of such a test on the performance in the asymptomatic population.

#### 12. Future Prospects for Monkeypox Testing and Preparedness

QA Block 12-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Will there be a need and opportunity for on‐site or point‐of‐care molecular or rapid antigen tests for monkeypox virus?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Point-of-care or rapid molecular tests for monkeypox would be valuable in an outbreak, but their development faces challenges, including FDA clearance processes, limited samples, and swabbing requirements. Developers are welcome to pursue test development, but there are considerations of resource commitment and risks.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Will there be a need and opportunity for on‐site or point‐of‐care molecular or rapid antigen tests for monkeypox virus?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So ideally, we would have such tests cleared. Obviously, such tests, in any outbreak situation, would be incredibly valuable. It's hard to tell which of the potential pathogens that could attack us next as a world and as a country would need FDA clearance or authorization prior to such an outbreak. The numbers of patients infected in the United States is still, I believe, in the 200s. We're not taking that lightly. Those are confirmed cases. As we expand testing, we don't know what's going to happen with regard to confirmed cases. They may increase. How much they may increase is unknown. This is clearly an international disease, and we're clearly seeing how travel contributes to cases within the United States. Developers, traditional kit manufacturing developers, are freely welcome to develop kits and come through the FDA full authorization process. That would‐‐ because the CDC test has already been cleared­ ‐ 510k FDA cleared‐‐ follow‐on assays would be 510ks. But that's a lot of work with very little samples. So that is a challenging path for most developers to pursue right now. And there has been some concern that you have to do vigorous swabbing to get a nice molecular result, clear molecular result. So I'm not sure how an antigen point‐of‐care test would perform on such a lesion or lesions. But you and anyone else are welcome to try to develop a test that can come to the U.S. market. You know there is quite a bit of development resource commitment and risk that this may not be‐‐ that this may not warrant that development. So Jeff Shuren and I have made certain recommendations and published those thoughts in a number of different publications about how a country might best prepare for a future outbreak. And we do believe that preparation can help. I know that there are discussions about what to do beyond the current response of the CDC‐‐ the CDC test, both in the LRN labs as well as in the commercial labs. And so I know that the U.S. government is looking seriously at all these options and discussing them. And we want to try to stay ahead of any needs here.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the validation requirements for antigen tests concerning omicron sub-lineages?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends antigen test developers consider the observed decrease in sensitivity for omicron variants. Studies beginning on or after March 1, 2022, do not require sequencing data as omicron prevalence is assumed, but developers should bank samples for future use if sub-lineage mutations arise. Studies before March 2022 require sequencing of at least 30 omicron-positive samples.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the validation requirements for antigen tests concerning omicron sub-lineages?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We had seen, early in the omicron era, that it looked like antigen tests were seeing a decrease in sensitivity. That's been posted on the FDA website for months now. And the data has continued to accumulate that it is not as sensitive. And so it's very important that we've been able to evaluate tests to date, at least, for their sensitivity for omicron so that users, clinicians, patients understand what the performance is for omicron. And we've seen the need, even for symptomatic patients, to require in the authorization serial testing because of the decreased sensitivity. And so we have looked at the increasing prevalence of omicron. And we were looking at a prevalence that reached a threshold of at least 99% over the entire country. And that date that we've established is begun on or after March 1, 2022, will no longer need to prospectively collect sequence and sequence samples for their FDA. We're no longer recommending that for the submissions for antigen tests. So therefore, if your antigen clinical study began on or after March 1st, there's good evidence that all positive samples are essentially omicron and we will not expect you to include sequencing data in your submission nor be automatically asked to provide it after EUA authorization. We do continue to recommend that you bank your clinical study samples for potential further analysis, which could include sequencing at a later date, should circumstance warrant it. How could that warrant it? If mutations occur in sub‐lineages of omicron that suggests further impacts on performance, we may need to do that. So please bank those samples. So if your antigen study began prior to March of this year, we do recommend 30 confirmed and sequenced omicron positive samples prior to authorization as the FDA is seen, as I said, a significant drop in antigen test sensitivity for omicron.

VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the sequencing requirements for antigen tests initiated after March 1, 2022, in light of omicron's prevalence?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So looking at the omicron prevalence and the impact, I wanted to discuss the impact on our current EUA recommendations for validation for antigen tests. We had seen, early in the omicron era, that it looked like antigen tests were seeing a decrease in sensitivity. That's been posted on the FDA website for months now. And the data has continued to accumulate that it is not as sensitive. And so it's very important that we've been able to evaluate tests to date, at least, for their sensitivity for omicron so that users, clinicians, patients understand what the performance is for omicron.

VERBATIM ANSWER: What I would do is put this in what's called a pre‐EUA. You can use, maybe, one of the serology templates and just fill in the information and make any edits to it about your assay. But we'd like to understand your assay design, your intended use, how you intend to validate it, and the intended use would include what sort of claims you would like around the results of such testing.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Don Cooper
