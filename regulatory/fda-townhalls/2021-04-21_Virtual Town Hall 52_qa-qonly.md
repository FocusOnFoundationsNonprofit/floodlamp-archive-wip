#### 1. FDA Updates on SARS-CoV-2 Testing Guidance and Authorizations

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What specific updates are included in the new pooling guidance for COVID-19 diagnostic tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA's new pooling guidance includes streamlined pathways for pooled serial screening of swabs and high-complexity lab tests previously authorized. It allows 3x pooling for high-sensitivity molecular central lab tests without needing further FDA review. The guidance also ensures additional mitigation through serial testing programs involving interior nasal specimens, enabling enhanced diagnosis and screening options.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What specific updates are included in the new pooling guidance for COVID-19 diagnostic tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We made a number of pooling authorizations as also, for screening authorizations. And these are for the pooling it's all been central lab high sensitivity molecular assays and we've learned a lot from all those submissions. And we, we have enough data from the previous submissions and their analysis of those. So that we could move forward with this new guidance that pertains to swabs and high complexity lab tests that have been previously authorized. I'd like to offer this review of streamlined pathway, in particular, we have not seen in the data we've received any issues when pool, in pools of three, 3x or less. As long as the test itself is a high sensitivity, molecular central lab test. And so, that, that, you know, to us gave us reassurance that we could offer the pathway if somebody under this new pathway wants to just offer a 3x pool, but we don't need to revisit it. We'll continue to monitor performance on market. You know of course, if there's any issues, we will address them. Going into just a bit more detail. So, you know, this is a new streamlined approach that pooled serial screening claims to certain authorized tests for use in serial testing programs. So, our previous review with FDA and authorizations allows us to go forward and the serial testing nature of this provides some additional mitigation for these authorizations to happen without the FDA first reviewing the data. And they are limited, as I said, to pool interior nasal respiratory specimens in a serial testing program. And so, that many of the molecular diagnostic tests that have already received EUA authorization have this pathway open to them.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Pooling guidance updates, Serial testing programs, Diagnostic tests
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the streamlined pathway mentioned, and how does it apply to pooling and serial testing?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The streamlined pathway allows pooled serial screening claims to apply to certain authorized tests for serial testing programs without requiring the FDA to first review data. It covers anterior nasal respiratory specimens, offering authorization for diagnosis and screening when tests are conducted at least weekly. EUA holders can validate their tests or notify the FDA for 3x pools, with updates reflected publicly.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the streamlined pathway mentioned, and how does it apply to pooling and serial testing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So, you know, this is a new streamlined approach that pooled serial screening claims to certain authorized tests for use in serial testing programs. So, our previous review with FDA and authorizations allows us to go forward and the serial testing nature of this provides some additional mitigation for these authorizations to happen without the FDA first reviewing the data. And they are limited, as I said, to pool interior nasal respiratory specimens in a serial testing program. And so, that many of the molecular diagnostic tests that have already received EUA authorization have this pathway open to them. So, these new authorizations and new pathway would offer authorization for both diagnosis and screening and when tested at least per week as part of a serial testing program. To utilize this approach, EUA holders would follow the guidance. You know if validation is required, go ahead and do that. If not, if it's the 3x pool, then once you've completed the validation or you've decided you're doing 3x, you know. You notify us and we'll update the labeling and post this on the FDA Website. The public including organizations purchasing these tests are using these services for testing pool specimens for the serial testing program can see the full list of tests that are then covered under this umbrella authorization.

QA Block 1-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Under what conditions can a 3x pooling claim be added without additional FDA data review?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: A 3x pooling claim can be added without additional FDA data review if the existing EUA test performs above 95% with clinical samples and is part of a serial testing program.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Under what conditions can a 3x pooling claim be added without additional FDA data review?
VERBATIM ANSWER: As Tim mentioned, if the existing EUA test performance with clinical sample that are above 95%. Then that 3x pooling claim is available as long as there's a serial testing program and these claims can be added to your existing EUA, either for swab, or media pooling.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Kris Roth (FDA)
TOPICS: 3x pooling claim, Serial testing program, EUA criteria
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What previous data or submissions support the new pooling guidance?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Pooling authorizations for central lab high-sensitivity molecular assays and data from these submissions and their analyses support the new pooling guidance for swabs and high-complexity lab tests.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What previous data or submissions support the new pooling guidance?

QA Block 1-5
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the differences in requirements for 3x, 5x, and 10x pooling claims?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: 3x pooling claims are available if the existing EUA test performance with clinical samples is above 95% and part of a serial testing program. Additional claims for 5x and 10x pooling require either analytical studies showing predictable test performance impacts or clinical studies comparing pooled and individual samples with specific performance criteria.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the differences in requirements for 3x, 5x, and 10x pooling claims?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So, if the existing EUA test performance with clinical sample that are above 95%. Then that 3x pooling claim is available as long as there's a serial testing program and these claims can be added to your existing EUA, either for swab, or media pooling. There's also two other I guess pooling levels, one of 5x and one of 10x, and they are both discussed again for swab and media pooling. And to get those from additional pooling claims, you know, there are two approaches which are the same for the 5x and 10x. And the first is an analytical study and in this case, it's, you know, the study is intended to establish that the pooling approach is impacting test performance in a predictable manner. This is evaluated by testing contrived samples and head-to-head kind of study, you know, both individually and pooled. And if the CT scores follow what was expected to, you know, due to the design of the pooling approach. For instance, if you're looking at 10x media pooling approach, you have a predictable 10x dilution effect on the CT score. You know there's acceptance criteria that's laid out there and, you know, if hat acceptance criteria is met then you can go ahead and notify with that particular data set. There's also the option to test pooled and individual clinical samples. This is very similar to the approach that's already laid out in the molecular template. You know we are looking for 20% to be near the LOD and this amendment calls for testing of 20 individual positives and then other clinical samples. And then take those same 20 and test them in the proposed pooling approach and I think the target there is an 85% agreement and, you know, 5% less, less than invalid rate.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Kris Roth (FDA)
TOPICS: Pooling claims, EUA requirements, Validation protocols
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-6
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What steps must EUA holders follow to include pooling claims in their existing authorizations?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: EUA holders must either validate their pooling approach or, for a 3x pool, notify the FDA, which will update labeling and post this information on their website.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What steps must EUA holders follow to include pooling claims in their existing authorizations?
VERBATIM ANSWER: To utilize this approach, EUA holders would follow the guidance. You know if validation is required, go ahead and do that.

REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-8
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the requirements for the analytical study used to validate the 5x and 10x pooling approaches?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The requirements for analytical validation of 5x and 10x pooling involve two pathways. First, an analytical study with contrived and pooled samples to predictably demonstrate the pooling's impact on test performance. Criteria include predictable effects on CT scores and acceptance criteria outlined in EUA guidance. Second, testing pooled and individual clinical samples, requiring 85% agreement on results and less than 5% invalid rates. Both approaches involve clear criteria provided in the amendment letter.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the requirements for the analytical study used to validate the 5x and 10x pooling approaches?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So, there are, you know, multiple validation pathways in this EUA Amendment and it does cover both swab and media pooling. So, if the existing, as Tim mentioned, if the existing EUA test performance with clinical sample that are above 95%. Then that 3x pooling claim is available as long as there's a serial testing program and these claims can be added to your existing EUA, either for swab, or media pooling. There's also two other I guess pooling levels, one of 5x and one of 10x, and they are both discussed again for swab and media pooling.

TOPICS: 5x and 10x pooling validation, EUA analytical study requirements, Pooling approach criteria
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-9
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What criteria must be met during a clinical study to validate pooling claims for existing EUA tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: EUA amendments require pathways for swab or media pooling validation. To validate 3x pooling claims, clinical performance must exceed 95% and include serial testing programs. For additional claims (e.g., 5x or 10x), the validation involves analytical studies or testing pooled versus individual samples. Acceptance criteria include predictable dilution effects, testing samples near LOD, 85% agreement, and a less than 5% invalid rate.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What criteria must be met during a clinical study to validate pooling claims for existing EUA tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: There are, you know, multiple validation pathways in this EUA Amendment and it does cover both swab and media pooling.

QA Block 1-10
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What additional steps are required if a test's pooling claims performance does not meet the 85% agreement rate?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: If a test's pooling claims do not meet the 85% agreement target, testing procedures call for 20 individual positives and pooled clinical samples to be evaluated per the molecular template approach.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What additional steps are required if a test's pooling claims performance does not meet the 85% agreement rate?

CLARIFIED QUESTION: How is the FDA facilitating the process for serial testing authorizations in public health programs?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA has introduced a streamlined process for pooled serial testing authorizations, allowing certain authorized molecular diagnostic tests under EUA to be used for serial testing without initial FDA review. This includes pooling nasal respiratory specimens and updating labeling after validation. Tests under this pathway are listed on the FDA website, making them accessible for public health programs.

#### 2. Swab Pooling Approvals and Regulatory Status Update

QA Block 2-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are there any tests that have gotten an EUA for swab pooling?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA is not certain of any EUAs for swab pooling as of now, but it is possible there may be at least one authorized test. Confirmation is pending.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are there any tests that have gotten an EUA for swab pooling?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Kris may know better. I'm not aware of it. You know one of the challenges with swab pooling is that you can't immediate deconvolute what's going on, you know, with the reflex test unless you collect two swabs. So, we have heard developers who are interested in swab pooling and in some ways, that at least analytically and clinically, there is lower risk for false negatives if you do swab pooling. But I may be incorrect, there may be at least one, I'm thing of one but Kris will know better perhaps if we've authorized one.

#### 3. Age Group Considerations for Testing and Home Use Evaluation

QA Block 3-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: If specifying no age restriction for professional use testing, do we need to show data for all age groups or just validate testing across various age ranges?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: For professional use testing, a specific age distribution study is not required as there is lower risk in healthcare settings. However, for home testing, data must cover adequate performance and safety in age ranges like 2–8 and 8–13. A two-year-old is not required in the study.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If specifying no age restriction for professional use testing, do we need to show data for all age groups or just validate testing across various age ranges?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So, the samples are obtained by some healthcare professional. We have a lower level of, we see a lower level of risk for different age groups when that's the case. Where we really focus on this is in, in the home collection, or home testing situation where kids underage, you know, won't be able to collect a sample themselves. And we, we want to see that the adults in the home can collect a sample in the underage child down to age 2 and show adequate performance and safety of the collection and of the testing. We, you don't need to find, you know, a two-year-old in your study. We sort of break up the underage kids into two big, bigger buckets and I'm forgetting exactly which ones they are.  But obviously, somewhere in the range of 2 to 8 and 8 to 13, I believe, are the two buckets and Kris may be able to correct me. And I don't believe we asked for a definite age distribution in the point of care setting but I could be wrong. We could have updated that because we have, feel reasonably assured, that those routinely collected samples in the point of care environment can do this accurately.

QA Block 3-6
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the FDA's recommendations for developers planning to progress towards home-use test authorizations?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA encourages developers aiming for home-use test authorization to focus their efforts on that setting directly. Conducting home-use studies first can streamline development, reduce costs, and allow the test to meet waiver status, making it usable in various environments without additional clinical studies.
VERBATIM QUESTION: IMPLICIT
VERBATIM ANSWER: We really are encouraging those who ultimately want to go to a home use test, whether prescription or over the counter, to really kind of focus their development efforts around that setting if they can. Because if they first do it staged and get a point of care authorization, they're then really are required to do another clinical study in the home. When you, if you were to go directly to a home-use situation and performance, you know, meets expectations when consumers are doing the collection and testing and/or interpretation of the test results themselves. The test automatically gets a wave, a deemed waived status, and automatically can, you know, be used in the point of care of moderate complexity, high complexity environments. Because we've really tested it at the most extreme version of untrained users and so, there could be a lot of synergy and streamlining. And decrease in costs of development if you feel comfortable that a test can go immediately to clinical studies in the home environment.

#### 5. Improving Antigen Test Performance Above CT 30 Threshold

QA Block 5-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What can we do to achieve the 10-20% of samples considered a low positive, with CT values above 30, as required by FDA?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Check if the molecular test used excludes initial cycles, which could affect CT values. Ensure samples are taken within inclusion criteria and within 0-7 days of symptom onset. Consider approaching the FDA through a pre-submission process for guidance.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What can we do to achieve the 10-20% of samples considered a low positive, with CT values above 30, as required by FDA?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. So, one obvious thing to check is some of the molecular assays don't count the first 10 or 15 cycles. So, make sure the EUA authorized high sensitive molecular test that you're using doesn't do that. For example, I know that the M2000 Abbott assay and the Lira assay do cutoff CT, so you have to add 10, I think it's 10, in both cases to the number to get the actual cycle threshold. But, you know, assuming that's not the case, first of all, it was kind of good news that you're getting in your studies, you're getting things that are shifted towards the higher positives. We have heard, in some studies, that they've seen a shift towards a lower positive, higher CTs, in their studies and they get sort of an over, you know, sampling of really lower viral load samples with high CTs. And, you know, I've always advised to those folks to make sure that they're collecting within, you know, five to seven days of symptom onset if they're going for the symptomatic test subject. And this is, I know what we do for molecular tests and that we have allowed a dilution of higher positives, you know, closer to, you know, the range around LOD that we want to see for and cutoff for molecular tests. It's a little more challenging with an antigen test. We, to date, you know, there's an all-comer study and you're testing as many people as you can enroll of your study subjects, study sites, and you're enrollment in multiple sites. And you're enrolling within your inclusion/exclusion criteria and the number of days post-symptoms. We've typically seen, when you go for those 30 positives for point of care, we've typically seen, or for the home use. We typically have seen a good range of CTs in the studies. It hasn't, it hasn't been an issue unless there was some, you know, unfortunately we've seen it with some developers a biased approach in selection of subjects. But again, if you take all comers within, you know, these zero to 5 day, zero to 7 in symptoms. We've typically, when there's been an unbiased selection of these subjects, we've typically seen good range. So, if you're really concerned about this I would approach through a pre-sub if you don't have, if you haven't already interacted with our staff on this particular topic and ask our experts what they think about this because it is a loophole and complicated especially if you are doing direct swab in antigen tests to be able to deal with that.

#### 11. Guidance on Home Use Serology Antibody Testing

QA Block 11-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Would FDA consider a prescription or over-the-counter designation for home use serology antibody tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA does not generally require a prescription for home use tests if over-the-counter validations are conducted. The main difference between prescription and OTC tests lies in usability studies. There is no current legal requirement for reporting by home use tests, but the FDA encourages developers to consider reporting mechanisms.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Would FDA consider a prescription or over-the-counter designation for home use serology antibody tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Okay. Those questions are clear, and I understand them. So, first thing I would recommend is that you do submit a pre-EUA for home serology tests and screening. We haven't authorized one before and we don't have a template out there. In general, for home use tests, you know, we don't require a prescription if the OTC, over the counter validations, are done. And, you know, one of the major differences between and Rx and OTC is that usability study where a user, not only performs the test, and reads the test but accurately interprets the results of the test and we have assurance that, that home users can use the test appropriately. As far as reporting goes, there's no legal, current legal requirement for home use tests, in home tests, to report. And therefore, the FDA is not making that a requirement at the time of first authorization.

VERBATIM QUESTION: If no prescription is needed for home use serology antibody tests, would a reporting capability be required?
VERBATIM ANSWER: As far as reporting goes, there's no legal, current legal requirement for home use tests, in home tests, to report. And therefore, the FDA is not making that a requirement at the time of first authorization. We are asking developers upfront what their plans are for reporting because that's good thing to encourage.

QA Block 11-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: When designing studies for home use antibody tests, should vaccinated individuals be included as part of the total clinical study subjects?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA suggests submitting a pre-EUA for specific guidance as vaccinated individuals in serology studies may interfere with test performance, unlike antigen or molecular test evaluations.
VERBATIM QUESTION: When designing studies for home use antibody tests, should vaccinated individuals be included as part of the total clinical study subjects?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So, vaccines and serology tests are a little bit more complicated than vaccines and antigen or molecular tests. So, for antigen and molecular tests, we, we just want to know if any of your subjects in the study were vaccinated and we want to analyze the data, the subset of data, for vaccinated individuals. It could be that their viral levels are lower if they have breakthrough infection, and we just want to understand that. For serology, it can really interfere with our assessment of the test performance. So, I would come in with a pre-EUA again with that question to our team about what you'd like to do, and we'll give you specific feedback of that.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: As an alternative, can vaccinated individuals be included as a separate group for additional data collection?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Vaccinated individuals can be included in studies, but for serology tests, their inclusion may complicate performance assessment. FDA recommends submitting a pre-EUA to get specific feedback based on study design.
VERBATIM QUESTION: As an alternative, can vaccinated individuals be included as a separate group for additional data collection?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So, vaccines and serology tests are a little bit more complicated than vaccines and antigen or molecular tests. So, for antigen and molecular tests, we, we just want to know if any of your subjects in the study were vaccinated and we want to analyze the data, the subset of data, for vaccinated individuals. It could be that their viral levels are lower if they have breakthrough infection, and we just want to understand that. For serology, it can really interfere with our assessment of the test performance. So, I would come in with a pre-EUA again with that question to our team about what you'd like to do, and we'll give you specific feedback of that.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Are developers expected to provide plans for reporting mechanisms upfront, even though there is no legal requirement at the time of first authorization?
VERBATIM ANSWER: As far as reporting goes, there's no legal, current legal requirement for home use tests, in home tests, to report. And therefore, the FDA is not making that a requirement at the time of first authorization. We are asking developers upfront what their plans are for reporting because that's good thing to encourage. And then we would follow-up, you know, an authorization with a requirement of authorization to come up with a subsequent reporting mechanism.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Has there been any approvals given for swab pooling?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is not certain, but they believe they may have authorized one swab pooling EUA. They will follow up to confirm.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Has there been any approvals given for swab pooling?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Kris may know better. I'm not aware of it. You know one of the challenges with swab pooling is that you can't immediate deconvolute what's going on, you know, with the reflex test unless you collect two swabs. So, we have heard developers who are interested in swab pooling and in some ways, that at least analytically and clinically, there is lower risk for false negatives if you do swab pooling. But I may be incorrect, there may be at least one, I'm thing of one but Kris will know better perhaps if we've authorized one. I am going to check on that. I believe we do have one and I can get that name for you just in a moment here.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Why is the FDA cautious about the use of saliva as a sample type for antigen tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We are, when comparative studies are done between swab and saliva and we ask for primarily NP swab, comparative saliva. We are seeing occasionally significant differences before or between those two samples and it always tends to show a decreased performance in saliva. So, we're encouraging all developers that if they're in the process of validating saliva or want to validate saliva through a device.
