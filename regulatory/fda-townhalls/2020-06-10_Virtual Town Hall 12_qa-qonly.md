#### 1. FDA Updates on COVID-19 Testing Procedures

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the updated notification pathways mentioned for enabling developers of validated tests to market their tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA has updated its guidance to allow developers of validated tests to notify the FDA if an EUA is required. Once confirmed, they are added to the notification list and can market their test in the U.S.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the updated notification pathways mentioned for enabling developers of validated tests to market their tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: This is, of course, why updated our guidance with the notification pathways so that once developers have validated their tests and if an EUA is required that they can notify us and then once that's been confirmed we'll add them to the notification list and they can market their test in the U.S.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Notification pathways for tests, EUA process updates
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What does the FDA mean by high-throughput tests and what criteria must these tests meet for prioritization?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA defines high-throughput tests as those capable of processing 200 or more tests per batch. These tests are prioritized due to their significant public health value in enabling faster and more efficient testing.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What does the FDA mean by high-throughput tests and what criteria must these tests meet for prioritization?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We typically define high throughput as having a batch size of, let's say, 200 or more tests per batch so that those applications obviously have - as all do, but also has significant public health importance because they allow us to get testing done more quickly and more efficiently.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: high-throughput tests, criteria for prioritization
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How does the FDA handle workloads for EUA applications that do not meet high-priority categories?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA informs developers of non-high-priority EUA applications that their submissions are received and will be addressed as soon as possible, though substantive review may not begin immediately. Eligible applications may proceed to market through the notification pathway if acknowledged.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How does the FDA handle workloads for EUA applications that do not meet high-priority categories?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We review applications when they come in. We make sure that there aren't any issues and we prioritize them based on the priorities that I've already mentioned. If there are no issues with the application and they are not in one of the high priority categories, we do let these developers know that we have received their application and that basically due to the volume of applications they will get to them as soon as possible, but in those cases a substantive review hasn't begun. And we - for those that are eligible through the notification pathway to be marketed in the U.S., we do our best to make sure that everybody knows, but if you fit in that category and you notify us and we acknowledge that, then you're allowed to go ahead and market.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE

#### 3. Evolving Understanding of Viral Infectivity and Immunity Testing

QA Block 3-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How would the information from the Bullard study about specimens collected after 8 days of symptoms or with CT values less than 24 not being culturable impact patient management recommendations?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA acknowledges the Bullard study, emphasizing that interpreting viral detection and its correlation with infectivity is still evolving. Understanding immunity, serology testing, and implications of persistent viral presence are ongoing areas of exploration for public health recommendations.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How would the information from the Bullard study about specimens collected after 8 days of symptoms or with CT values less than 24 not being culturable impact patient management recommendations?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. So I'm familiar with that paper and I read it. It's interesting. There are some challenges when you culture a virus and it may not culture all viruses, but I think there's a couple of really good takeaways from that paper. One is that it does kind of chart on what the viral level course through infection to resolution, perhaps of symptoms. There is - this is a place where science is still evolving to determine even, say, long after or just after symptoms resolve if there's detectable nucleic acid or genetic material of the virus in a patient sample, what is the meaning of that? I think as we begin to learn more about immunity and as we have patients be NWX-FDA OC tested and confirmed with serology tests and as we start - are able to start, say, authorizing - neutralizing antibody tests and we're very open to accepting and neutralizing antibody tests, which, of course, will add information about whether the antibodies that have been raised to the virus by patient are actually able to impact immunity. So this is still an evolving area and if someone remains positive, say, by virus after they incubate the 7-day period and their symptoms are resolving, you know, what does that mean as far as the chance for them to potentially infect somebody else, potentially relapse. Those are still open questions and we do track that science very closely and - because we do get asked on a fairly frequent basis on the FDA's opinion on how this information should be used for public health purposes. Thank you.

#### 4. Asymptomatic Screening with At-Home Prescription Testing

QA Block 4-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How can asymptomatic screening for return to work be reconciled with at-home testing?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA states that asymptomatic screening via at-home testing depends on whether the test is over-the-counter or by prescription. For prescription tests authorized for suspected COVID-19 patients with a healthcare provider's order, results should be properly reported and used.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How can asymptomatic screening for return to work be reconciled with at-home testing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So it kind of depends on if the at-home testing is by prescription or is over-the-counter. There's… You'd do prescription? So if a test is authorized for testing on patients who are suspected of having COVID-19 and there is an order for that test by a health care professional. Then that is covered for a - we, you know - we say that the testing for the asymptomatic person, we would want that result to be reported out and utilized as appropriate.

#### 5. High Complexity Labs and Saliva-Based COVID Test Modifications

QA Block 5-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does a high complexity laboratory have the ability to deviate from the indications of use for a device, such as performing a COVID test using saliva when authorized assays do not include saliva?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Yes, high complexity labs can modify authorized tests to include saliva as a sample type if the underlying test has an EUA and the validation proves accurate performance.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does a high complexity laboratory have the ability to deviate from the indications of use for a device, such as performing a COVID test using saliva when authorized assays do not include saliva?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. So we have recommendations in our templates, in our molecular templates, about the use and - of saliva and our recommended validation of saliva. Just to remind listeners that saliva in our reviews have had variable performances and there are some that we have - when they have come in for EUA authorization that we have not been able to authorize due to inferior performance. So we feel like saliva is a sample type. It is a very important specimen to validate properly and ensure that we're getting accurate results with saliva in comparison to a usual swab-type sample. As far as what high complexity labs are allowed to do, on our FAQ page we state that labs can validate sample types that have already been authorized and we have confidence that they can be validated to be performed accurately and, you know, as long as the underlying test that they're using has an EUA authorization, then the modification to add saliva is acceptable as long as your validation shows that it performs well. We encourage clinicians, but it's not required for high complexity LDC labs to make that kind of a modification to an EUA test.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA has authorized nasal washes, and oral fluid is considered similar to saliva. Any novel specimen collection, including oral fluid, must be validated properly and meet performance standards similar to those used for saliva.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Would the ability to modify an EUA authorized COVID test include using novel specimen collections other than saliva, such as nasal washes or other oral fluid specimens?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So we've authorized nasal washes. Oral fluid is really in the same category as saliva. So however you collect that oral fluid, saliva, as long as you validate it and it performs well, you can use the saliva recommended validation to guide you.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the FDA's validation expectations for saliva in terms of accuracy compared to swab-type samples?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA emphasizes proper validation of saliva-based diagnostics due to variable performances observed during EUA reviews. Accurate results must be demonstrated in comparison to swab samples, ensuring equivalence. Labs can modify EUA-authorized tests to include saliva, provided validation is successful.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the FDA's validation expectations for saliva in terms of accuracy compared to swab-type samples?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. So we have recommendations in our templates, in our molecular templates, about the use and - of saliva and our recommended validation of saliva. Just to remind listeners that saliva in our reviews have had variable performances and there are some that we have - when they have come in for EUA authorization that we have not been able to authorize due to inferior performance. So we feel like saliva is a sample type. It is a very important specimen to validate properly and ensure that we're getting accurate results with saliva in comparison to a usual swab-type sample. As far as what high complexity labs are allowed to do, on our FAQ page we state that labs can validate sample types that have already been authorized and we have confidence that they can be validated to be performed accurately and, you know, as long as the underlying test that they're using has an EUA authorization, then the modification to add saliva is acceptable as long as your validation shows that it performs well.

#### 6. POC Testing Validation and CLIA Waiver Distinctions Explained

QA Block 6-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Will the POC template be changed?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA states that the recommendations in the POC template are consistent and focus on validation in healthcare settings for non-laboratory trained users, with some outlined categories provided to address variability and accuracy concerns.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Will the POC template be changed?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. I believe our POC recommendation for validations are in at least one of the templates and they're pretty identical to one another and just assure that in a health care setting that lay users which we design is non-laboratory trained personnel, you know, nurses, physicians, allied health folks who are normally doing the testing in that setting - for that POC setting. NWX-FDA OC That the test be shown to be accurate when they perform the test, only with the instructions that come with the test and without any specific training, of course, to be able to have a lay user get an accurate result does require perhaps some additional developments at least of easy-to-read instructions, but also the work flow related to the work flow. If there's any user interface for that test or there's any chance of variability such as volume, such as time, et cetera, and those particular kinds of different categories are outlined in the template briefly, but they're given there. Then we look to flex studies around those time point conditions to show if that particular essay or test is - and the instructions for use for that are anywhere near a point where accuracy may go down if you go, you know, too long or too under time or too much or too little of volume in a lay user population.

REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 6-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can you clarify the distinctions between POC, CLIA waived, telemedicine, and at-home applications?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA explains that POC tests are designed for lay users like nurses or physicians in healthcare settings and require simple, clear instructions. At-home tests include prescription (involving healthcare providers) and OTC versions, with stricter accuracy requirements for OTC due to increased risks. CLIA-waived tests are authorized for use outside high complexity labs and require EUA. Developers often start with POC authorizations before expanding to at-home use cases.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can you clarify the distinctions between POC, CLIA waived, telemedicine, and at-home applications?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. I believe our POC recommendation for validations are in at least one of the templates and they're pretty identical to one another and just assure that in a health care setting that lay users which we design is non-laboratory trained personnel, you know, nurses, physicians, allied health folks who are normally doing the testing in that setting - for that POC setting.

If there's any user interface for that test or there's any chance of variability such as volume, such as time, et cetera, and those particular kinds of different categories are outlined in the template briefly, but they're given there. Then we look to flex studies around those time point conditions to show if that particular essay or test is - and the instructions for use for that are anywhere near a point where accuracy may go down if you go, you know, too long or too under time or too much or too little of volume in a lay user population. When it comes to other environments OTC or home, there's two kinds of home. There's prescription home and there's OTC, or over-the-counter. We've seen the involvement of the health care provider in writing an order and being involved in the test and selecting for what tests and when a test should be performed and reviewing the results and guiding many patients through on what to do with those results. Perhaps there's follow-on testing that would be helpful. Perhaps a recommendation on isolation or other situations. So when a clinician or health care worker is involved, that does mitigate some of the risk versus a completely over-the-counter test -- which we are open to -- but may require additional accuracy testing when a health care provider is not involved. NWX-FDA OC So as far as CLIA waiver, if a test is going to be performed outside of the high complexity lab situation, then it does require EUA authorization to render the test by our office and we determine if that test can be performed outside of a CLIA - a high complexity CLIA waived environment and we will note that both in our authorization and in on the listing on our Web site as either M for Moderate or W for Waived. Frequently, a test that may be used for home or for a non-health care environment situation with non-health care workers performing it, typically a developer might go through a point of care authorization demonstrating that lay users - lay health care users can accurately do it on the way to delivering something either by prescription to the home or over-the-counter.

#### 10. Addressing Export Challenges with China's White and Black Lists

QA Block 10-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are you aware of the Chinese white list and black list for test kits?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is aware of the Chinese white and black lists for test kits. They are working with international colleagues, including in China, to address related issues. Developers can be placed on the white list during development under certain limitations, and the FDA encourages reporting export issues to their email so they can assist.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are you aware of the Chinese white list and black list for test kits?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, we are aware of those lists. Yes, we do our best. We have worked with our international colleagues, in particular, those in China, to address this issue and we have international experts within the center at the FDA who have worked hard on this issue and certainly have tried their best and made some progress. I have personally when called upon helped out get those developers on the white list when my help could help those companies and there is the ability to be on the white list while you're still in development and may want to do the validation testing in the United States, which, of course, we would support. And that - those have limits on the amount of tests or kits that can be sent at a given time. So we recognize the limitations there. So I - it's - if a test is on the notified list and is allowed to be marketed in the U.S. and you're having export issues in China, send us information onto our template email address and we will certainly raise it to our colleagues within the center who help us deal with that particular issue and we'll do our best to help out.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the FDA require two tests before reporting a positive antibody test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA does not require two tests before reporting a positive antibody test, but recommends confirming results with a second serology test in appropriate situations. The second test should target different proteins or parts of a protein. This helps improve positive predictive value, especially in low-prevalence areas.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA require two tests before reporting a positive antibody test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. Yes, absolutely. Well, we developed that calculator within our office to try to help in this situation. Particularly, even with high specificity tests, single tests, high-performing tests where prevalence might be low, below 5% -- which probably is true in large areas of the country fortunately still -- that a positive doesn't have always a great positive prediction value. So we in our - we work for the CDC on serology guidance or recommendations. Not sure if it qualifies as guidance in legal terms. I think recommendations that we recommend that in appropriate situations where it's important that you NWX-FDA OC confirm a result with a second serology test. We do not require that in our EUA authorizations, so we try to stress that it should be a different serology test and we - there may be tests that look at different parts of the different proteins even though it might ultimately target the same protein if it targets different parts of that protein that may be enough obviously having the spike in an unintelligible an-protein is clearly two different tests would be the easiest for providers to assess. So we have asked and are requiring that this information be present to the instructions for use and we certainly, I think, can look at whether we can make this information a little bit more transparent on our Web site so it's easy for clinical folks to extend laboratory folks to take a look and make recommendations about if you're going to do a unintelligible test what is it. What's interesting is that even if you have an authorized test, it has the specificity above our bar, if you combine, you know, two say 95% specific assays together that are different orthogonal, you end up even as the lower predictive population it's having a fairly decent positive prediction value.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Why does the FDA recommend, but not require, a second serology test in some situations?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends but does not require a second serology test because in low-prevalence areas, a single test may have limited positive predictive value. Using a second, distinct serology test improves confidence in results, especially if the tests target different protein parts. Such guidance is designed to enhance reliability but is not a mandate in authorizations.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Why does the FDA recommend, but not require, a second serology test in some situations?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. Yes, absolutely. Well, we developed that calculator within our office to try to help in this situation. Particularly, even with high specificity tests, single tests, high-performing tests where prevalence might be low, below 5% -- which probably is true in large areas of the country fortunately still -- that a positive doesn't have always a great positive prediction value. So we in our - we work for the CDC on serology guidance or recommendations. Not sure if it qualifies as guidance in legal terms. I think recommendations that we recommend that in appropriate situations where it's important that you NWX-FDA OC confirm a result with a second serology test. We do not require that in our EUA authorizations, so we try to stress that it should be a different serology test and we - there may be tests that look at different parts of the different proteins even though it might ultimately target the same protein if it targets different parts of that protein that may be enough obviously having the spike in an unintelligible an-protein is clearly two different tests would be the easiest for providers to assess. So we have asked and are requiring that this information be present to the instructions for use and we certainly, I think, can look at whether we can make this information a little bit more transparent on our Web site so it's easy for clinical folks to extend laboratory folks to take a look and make recommendations about if you're going to do a unintelligible test what is it. What's interesting is that even if you have an authorized test, it has the specificity above our bar, if you combine, you know, two say 95% specific assays together that are different orthogonal, you end up even as the lower predictive population it's having a fairly decent positive prediction value. I hope that addressed your question.

#### 14. Safety Concerns for At-Home Saliva Test Spillage

QA Block 14-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is there the same risk of exposure to cyanide gas from guanidine thiocyanate in home collection devices as noted in laboratory clean-up settings?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA deems home use collection devices containing guanidinium to be safe, as these are designed to block exposure to the chemical by sealing it after sample collection. However, potential risks, such as those in unique home situations, need consideration.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is there the same risk of exposure to cyanide gas from guanidine thiocyanate in home collection devices as noted in laboratory clean-up settings?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. So we realize that guanidine alone and not in connection and/or in mixing with bleach in and of itself is a toxic chemical and when we authorize a home test, a home collection rather - and I think we've only authorized one so far that NWX-FDA OC has guanidinium in it - it is the device that blocks exposure to the chemical. In that particular case, the chemical is only in contact with the sample after a sample is taken and the device is closed and in closing the device and releasing the chemical it prevents - it locks the cap and prevents leakage and prevents access to that at that point. So at least in the home collection situation we seek to only authorize collection methods that we deem to be safe and we do consider that sort of situation in particular with guanidinium. There could be a testing situation in the home where that may be an issue and you highlighted an important safety consideration that we want to keep in mind, but it would be odd that a saliva sample collected at home for home testing wouldn't necessarily go through guanidinium straight onto the device and not need guanidinium in the sample.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the FDA anticipate issuing updated templates or additional guidance on protein concentration parameters for antigen COVID-19 tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA suggests looking at direct antigen tests regarding protein concentration parameters. It depends on the copy number of the protein targeted in the virus particle, which can influence sensitivity and LOD. This area may require additional guidance.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA anticipate issuing updated templates or additional guidance on protein concentration parameters for antigen COVID-19 tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, I might look at the direct antigen test because that, I forget how that translates but maybe Toby can help me out , but it's kind of similar to the direct antigen test which look at protein rather than nucleic acid. So it would depend on the copy number of the protein in the virus particle. So if you're using - if you're targeting a protein that has higher copy numbers than one relative to, you know, the virus particle or in some other ways greatly amplify the virus particle that can - obviously, that would obviously increase your sensitivity, but it also helps your LOD as well. I just don't remember if the direct antigen test dealt with dilutions of proteins and generalities have to do with...

CLARIFIED QUESTION: How does the FDA assist developers in working with Chinese counterparts to address white list or black list issues?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA works with international colleagues, including in China, to address white list and black list issues and has international experts focused on this. The FDA has also helped developers gain placement on the white list when possible, particularly for tests allowed for marketing or validation in the U.S. Developers can email the FDA with information on such issues for further assistance.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How does the FDA assist developers in working with Chinese counterparts to address white list or black list issues?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, we are aware of those lists. Yes, we do our best. We have worked with our international colleagues, in particular, those in China, to address this issue and we have international experts within the center at the FDA who have worked hard on this issue and certainly have tried their best and made some progress. I have personally when called upon helped out get those developers on the white list when my help could help those companies and there is the ability to be on the white list while you're still in development and may want to do the validation testing in the United States, which, of course, we would support. And that - those have limits on the amount of tests or kits that can be sent at a given time. So we recognize the limitations there. So I - it's - if a test is on the notified list and is allowed to be marketed in the U.S. and you're having export issues in China, send us information onto our template email address and we will certainly raise it to our colleagues within the center who help us deal with that particular issue and we'll do our best to help out.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What does the FDA recommend for orthogonal testing when reporting antibody test results?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends using a second serology test in certain cases to confirm positive results, particularly when the prevalence of conditions is low. They suggest using a different serology test targeting different protein parts to improve prediction value, though this is not a requirement.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What does the FDA recommend for orthogonal testing when reporting antibody test results?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Well, we developed that calculator within our office to try to help in this situation. Particularly, even with high specificity tests, single tests, high-performing tests where prevalence might be low, below 5% -- which probably is true in large areas of the country fortunately still -- that a positive doesn't have always a great positive prediction value. So we in our - we work for the CDC on serology guidance or recommendations. Not sure if it qualifies as guidance in legal terms. I think recommendations that we recommend that in appropriate situations where it's important that you NWX-FDA OC confirm a result with a second serology test. We do not require that in our EUA authorizations, so we try to stress that it should be a different serology test and we - there may be tests that look at different parts of the different proteins even though it might ultimately target the same protein if it targets different parts of that protein that may be enough obviously having the spike in an unintelligible an-protein is clearly two different tests would be the easiest for providers to assess. So we have asked and are requiring that this information be present to the instructions for use and we certainly, I think, can look at whether we can make this information a little bit more transparent on our Web site so it's easy for clinical folks to extend laboratory folks to take a look and make recommendations about if you're going to do a unintelligible test what is it. What's interesting is that even if you have an authorized test, it has the specificity above our bar, if you combine, you know, two say 95% specific assays together that are different orthogonal, you end up even as the lower predictive population it's having a fairly decent positive prediction value.
