#### 1. FDA Updates and Guidance on SARS-CoV-2 Testing

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What recommendations should developers follow when validating tests intended for EUA submission versus tests offered under policies prior to an EUA request?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Developers should follow the FDA's recommendations for validation found in guidance and EUA templates, which apply to both tests submitted for EUA and those offered under policies before an EUA request.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What recommendations should developers follow when validating tests intended for EUA submission versus tests offered under policies prior to an EUA request?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The first question that we updated last week was the question about current validation study recommendations. And we updated that question to clarify that the recommendations for testing apply - the FDA's recommendations for testing apply both to tests for which an EUA request is submitted as well as tests that are claiming to be validated and offered under the policies in the guidance prior to submission of an EUA request. So those recommendations for validation are included in both the guidance and the accompanying EUA templates. So we encourage developers to consult those documents for those recommendations.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: Validation recommendations, EUA submission policies
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: When modifying a previously authorized test, what is the distinction between modifications requiring additional authorizations and those that do not?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA clarified that modifications by high complexity CLIA Certified Labs under certain policies are outside the EUA scope and considered non-authorized tests. Two policies exist: one for adding new specimen types (guided by templates without bridging studies) and another for all other modifications.
VERBATIM QUESTION: When modifying a previously authorized test, what is the distinction between modifications requiring additional authorizations and those that do not?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We updated that question to clarify a couple of points. The first is that modifications that are done by a high complexity CLIA Certified Lab under the policy in the guidance when we don't expect an EUA it does come outside of the scope of the EUA and therefore those tests are being offered as non-authorized tests. And then the other clarification was to point out that we have two different policies regarding modifications. One is for tests that are modifying to add a new specimen type. And the other is for all other types of modifications. And we're pointing out that for new specimen types the guidance does not include validation using a bridging study. So that type of modification we are encouraging developers to reference the information in the guidance and the templates regarding recommendations for validation of a new specimen type.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)

#### 2. Progress on At-Home Diagnostic Testing Templates

QA Block 2-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are your thoughts on at-home use products that could be over the counter versus prescription use?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is open to home testing for both prescription use and over-the-counter (OTC) scenarios. Prescription home use requires clinician involvement, which reduces validation requirements, while OTC use demands higher validation standards since healthcare providers are not involved. Key elements such as usability studies for consumers are being considered, and templates are being finalized.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are your thoughts on at-home use products that could be over the counter versus prescription use?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. So thanks for that question. So we're very open to home testing not just for molecular but also a rapid antigen and serology tests. We are in the, we are finalizing the home testing template for unintelligible molecular and direct antigen tests. And we hope to get that out shortly. In the interim if you want to send an email to the template's email address and we will at least put your name and contact information on a list as that becomes publicly available. We NWX-FDA OC plan to send that out to a number of folks as soon as that is finalized. So yes. We are open to both prescription home use and to OTC. We call it prescription home use because it does require a prescription by a clinician to be able to offer this test. And we call it home even though we believe that this will be outside of a healthcare center and so it can be deployed in many different settings where there are not necessarily healthcare providers. So this could potentially be deployed readily at home but in other places such as schools and workplaces. Now the fact that there is healthcare involvement in deciding the appropriateness of testing means that there are mitigations with that approach that will allow a lower amount of validations being done than for a situation such as being over the counter or OTC situations where there will unlikely to be healthcare involvement in selecting who buys the test and who performs the test and in what situations it's run. So we will be asking for a higher level of validation in that situation because there are not mitigations of a healthcare provider or worker being involved at all in the testing. So those exact numbers are being finalized now. And so it would be premature for me to talk about that in detail. But when there is a prescription involved we're looking for the very least burdensome approach to this and it probably will be very similar to what we require, say, for a point of care test except in this case we're going to be asking that consumers, that people in the setting where you wish the test to get deployed are performing the tests, a minimal number of users in the usability study. And so they can demonstrate that they can get an accurate result.

#### 6. Updating Prevalence for Accurate Test Validity Calculations

QA Block 6-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: When will the FDA update prevalence values for positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) calculations?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA will periodically review and reassess if the 5% prevalence value used on their website is suitable for most situations. They provide a calculator to input specific prevalence and performance metrics for more accurate PPV and NPV calculations.
VERBATIM QUESTION: When will the FDA update prevalence values for positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) calculations?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. So the prevalence of disease and adaptive immune response can vary widely across the US right now. It's a good heads up for us to take a look at that from time to time and make sure that it is an appropriate prevalence for the vast majority of the US. As an example - it's only offered as an example and it is not meant to apply to each and every situation. So we do - on that same Web site - we do provide a calculator to be able to plug in the actual performance and prevalence. And from the information even that is provided on our Web site insert the performance codes and the user or the end-user can see what the predicted positive and negative values are. So that tool is provided to all so that this can information can be made available to all and to look at the individual situation and make it specific for that situation. So please feel free to use that calculator and encourage the folks that you're talking to, to use that calculator. And so we will take that back as to whether that 5% is still a good number to use on our Web site. We're unfortunately not going to be able to get every possible prevalence and not just high prevalence areas or low prevalence areas because it does matter what the prevalence is as far as the NPV and PPV.

So, they're not, you know, they're not indicated any differently, other than to include the date they are added to the table. And then, the notified tests are listed separately on the notification list on the FAQ page. So, there's not really any way for us to note them differently because they are being offered under different pathways and we have not reviewed them and authorized them at that point.

You know, that's their mission as of right now. These are excellent points as some of these tests start converting into regular authorization, developers should consider this. Because this is an important element that you would like to see in all tests, that we have for more routine not emergency authorization. You know, I think those developers are sometimes doing that during this emergency and show that in their development and in there data may have, you know, adapt over others that don't do that. So, point very well taken. Ideally we would actually love that. And as we move forward in this pandemic, we have updated the requirements for validation doing some contrived samples and actual samples.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are there separate validation requirements for transitioning a test from emergency authorization to regular authorization?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA acknowledges that transitioning a test from emergency authorization to regular authorization involves additional considerations for tighter standards. Emergency-authorized tests prioritize rapid deployment without full optimization. FDA has been updating validation requirements, including postmarket assessments, to meet evolving needs.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are there separate validation requirements for transitioning a test from emergency authorization to regular authorization?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. I understand and where developers have months or years to develop a test and optimize all of these things. Those are obviously things we would hope to see.

#### 10. Challenges and Considerations in Pooling Testing Strategies

QA Block 10-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What's the status of pooling and are there any vendor-approved EUAs for pooling?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is open to pooling but has not authorized any pooling schemes yet. Labs and manufacturers can submit validated schemes for EUA review. Pooling can help address reagent shortages and testing capacity but reduces test sensitivity, leading to potential false negatives, especially for low-positive patients. Smaller pools may mitigate sensitivity loss. The FDA recommends labeling pooled negatives as presumed negative, urging caution and validation.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What's the status of pooling and are there any vendor-approved EUAs for pooling?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So, we are absolutely open to pooling. We have not authorized a pooling scheme yet. We are asking for EUA submissions. Labs or manufacturers can come up with their scheme, validate it and notify us and submit within 15 business days. And we'll review those schemes and look to authorize them. You can use, for this, you can either use your own EUA authorized test or you can use a manufacturers' test to do this. And, we've started looking at some preliminary data about pooling. It's not unfortunately going to be a panacea. Yes, it will address reagent shortages. Yes, it can expand our capacity to test more and more patients with the given infrastructure that we have, but nearly all pooling schemes will reduce the sensitivity of the assay. And therefore, we do predict that patients, especially low positive patients may be missed in pooling schemes and called falsely negative so we've made the recommendation that negatives are called presumed negative when samples are pooled, just to alert the ordering clinicians or healthcare workers that if clinical signs and symptoms warrant, they may want to follow up with a non- pooled test for certain patients. And the other thing is early preliminary data suggests smaller pools are more likely to have less sensitivity drop, which makes complete sense. So, we would urge caution in this approach and fully validate your pooling scheme. And have a pretty robust design, so that you know that if you're missing any positives that its a really low amount. But given the situation, we understand, and we'll be working with developers, we're updating information about pooling, pooling schemes. And some of the concerns we have and some additional guidance once we gain more information about which pooling scheme may be working the best and minimize the test with false negatives. But some of the early data that we've seen, suggests that there could be a larger percentage of false negatives, depending on the population that you're pooling. So caution is warranted here. NWX-FDA OC Let's see, what other things could come up. The important thing is that one of the pooling schemes that may have less risk, although not zero for false negative is to put multiple swabs into one VTM. You could have potentially increased inhibition that needs to be guarded against. Obviously the other challenge of doing that is, how do you de-convolute a positive pool and know which one of the swabs was positive. So, the schemes for that are unfortunately complicated as well because they either mean going back to everybody who is in that pool or requiring two swabs of each individual and then swabs are often in short supply. So, this is a very challenging situation. The FDA is open to it. We're out of an abundance of caution, we're asking for submissions and EUA authorization at least for the time being so we can figure out which schemes are going to work. We are, and we are encouraging all manufacturers to come in with pooling applications as well. So that those are automatically, you know, once they are reviewed authorized available for customers to use.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is it possible to put multiple swabs into one VTM to reduce pooling risks, and what are the associated challenges?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA stated that putting multiple swabs into one VTM may reduce false negatives but poses risks like inhibition and difficulties in identifying which swab in the pool is positive. Addressing these challenges may require retesting or multiple swabs, which are already in short supply.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is it possible to put multiple swabs into one VTM to reduce pooling risks, and what are the associated challenges?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The important thing is that one of the pooling schemes that may have less risk, although not zero for false negative is to put multiple swabs into one VTM. You could have potentially increased inhibition that needs to be guarded against. Obviously the other challenge of doing that is, how do you de-convolute a positive pool and know which one of the swabs was positive. So, the schemes for that are unfortunately complicated as well because they either mean going back to everybody who is in that pool or requiring two swabs of each individual and then swabs are often in short supply.

#### 11. Strategies and Challenges in Pool Testing Implementation

QA Block 11-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Could you clarify strategies for handling a positive result in pool testing, particularly involving each patient using two swabs?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA acknowledges that using two swabs per patient can strain already limited supplies. They are open to working with developers to find feasible strategies, noting that pooling efficacy depends on the prevalence of positive cases. For high incidence, pooling may be less effective.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Could you clarify strategies for handling a positive result in pool testing, particularly involving each patient using two swabs?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. It does put pressure on swabs which have been in short supply at times, currently. And also, what do you do if you have a high volume, what do you do with those swabs, how do you store them, how do you inventory them, how do you go back to them easily. So, unfortunately, there's no, you know, ideal options here. I'm just saying that the FDA is open to different options and wanting to work with developers on what will work for them. And of course, it all depends on the incidence of positives in your population. So, some pooling schemes, particularly combinatorial schemes, . they don't work, for really high prevalence, high incidence situation where the prevalence of positive results is high or the incidence of positive results is high. And the, you know, most of those are relatively low. The low incidence populations, low prevalence populations are going to be better for combinatorial schemes and simple pooling is going to be better for higher prevalence but once you reach about 20% positivity almost any pooling scheme is less ideal.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What defines a prescription home use test versus an over-the-counter (OTC) test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: A prescription home use test requires a clinician's prescription and healthcare involvement, allowing for fewer validations. In contrast, OTC tests lack healthcare involvement, necessitating more robust validation.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What defines a prescription home use test versus an over-the-counter (OTC) test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We call it prescription home use because it does require a prescription by a clinician to be able to offer this test. And we call it home even though we believe that this will be outside of a healthcare center and so it can be deployed in many different settings where there are not necessarily healthcare providers. So this could potentially be deployed readily at home but in other places such as schools and workplaces. Now the fact that there is healthcare involvement in deciding the appropriateness of testing means that there are mitigations with that approach that will allow a lower amount of validations being done than for a situation such as being over the counter or OTC situations where there will unlikely to be healthcare involvement in selecting who buys the test and who performs the test and in what situations it's run.

VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the proper validation steps and collection devices for saliva specimen types?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. So, that 30 and 30 is - if I remember correctly - is what we would recommend. The only thing that's different is of course if you're making a claim for an asymptomatic population. And then look to our recommendations on the EUA authorization required for that. And of course this doesn't apply to home collection and home testing. Toby anything to add about that?...Yes. The only thing that I'd add this came up recently as an issue that we're looking as rapidly as possible to resolve is that there are actually no saliva collection devices that are authorized for this purpose. So we are working with collection device manufacturers to try to resolve that as quickly as possible to have more options be available for tests such as yours and labs such as yours where you would like to add saliva as a specimen type through the NWX-FDA OC modifications policy.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What preliminary data has the FDA seen regarding the sensitivity of pooling schemes?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Preliminary data indicates that pooling schemes can address reagent shortages and testing capacity but often reduce test sensitivity. Low positive patients may be missed and falsely reported as negative. Smaller pools tend to have less sensitivity drop, and caution with robust validation is recommended. Early data also suggests a risk of higher false negatives depending on the pooled population.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What preliminary data has the FDA seen regarding the sensitivity of pooling schemes?
VERBATIM ANSWER: And, we've started looking at some preliminary data about pooling. It's not unfortunately going to be a panacea. Yes, it will address reagent shortages. Yes, it can expand our capacity to test more and more patients with the given infrastructure that we have, but nearly all pooling schemes will reduce the sensitivity of the assay. And therefore, we do predict that patients, especially low positive patients may be missed in pooling schemes and called falsely negative so we've made the recommendation that negatives are called presumed negative when samples are pooled, just to alert the ordering clinicians or healthcare workers that if clinical signs and symptoms warrant, they may want to follow up with a non- pooled test for certain patients. And the other thing is early preliminary data suggests smaller pools are more likely to have less sensitivity drop, which makes complete sense. So, we would urge caution in this approach and fully validate your pooling scheme. And have a pretty robust design, so that you know that if you're missing any positives that its a really low amount. But given the situation, we understand, and we'll be working with developers, we're updating information about pooling, pooling schemes. And some of the concerns we have and some additional guidance once we gain more information about which pooling scheme may be working the best and minimize the test with false negatives. But some of the early data that we've seen, suggests that there could be a larger percentage of false negatives, depending on the population that you're pooling. So caution is warranted here.

QA Block 10-8
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What challenges exist in de-convoluting a positive pool when multiple swabs are placed in one VTM?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: De-convoluting a positive pool in a VTM is challenging because it may require retesting everyone in the pool or using two swabs per individual, which is difficult due to swab shortages.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What challenges exist in de-convoluting a positive pool when multiple swabs are placed in one VTM?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Obviously the other challenge of doing that is, how do you de-convolute a positive pool and know which one of the swabs was positive. So, the schemes for that are unfortunately complicated as well because they either mean going back to everybody who is in that pool or requiring two swabs of each individual and then swabs are often in short supply.

TOPICS: pooling challenges, de-convoluting positive pools
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 10-15
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Why does the FDA recommend labeling negative results as 'presumed negative' for pooled samples?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends labeling negative results as 'presumed negative' for pooled samples because pooling reduces assay sensitivity, which may lead to false negatives, particularly in low positive patients. This advises clinicians to consider follow-up testing if warranted.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Why does the FDA recommend labeling negative results as 'presumed negative' for pooled samples?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We've started looking at some preliminary data about pooling. It's not unfortunately going to be a panacea. Yes, it will address reagent shortages. Yes, it can expand our capacity to test more and more patients with the given infrastructure that we have, but nearly all pooling schemes will reduce the sensitivity of the assay. And therefore, we do predict that patients, especially low positive patients may be missed in pooling schemes and called falsely negative so we've made the recommendation that negatives are called presumed negative when samples are pooled, just to alert the ordering clinicians or healthcare workers that if clinical signs and symptoms warrant, they may want to follow up with a non- pooled test for certain patients.

REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 10-16
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the FDA's concerns about using multiple swabs in one VTM for pooling?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA's concerns with pooling multiple swabs in one VTM include increased inhibition and the difficulty in identifying which swab is positive, requiring retesting or additional swabs, which may also be in short supply.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the FDA's concerns about using multiple swabs in one VTM for pooling?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The important thing is that one of the pooling schemes that may have less risk, although not zero for false negative is to put multiple swabs into one VTM. You could have potentially increased inhibition that needs to be guarded against. Obviously the other challenge of doing that is, how do you de-convolute a positive pool and know which one of the swabs was positive. So, the schemes for that are unfortunately complicated as well because they either mean going back to everybody who is in that pool or requiring two swabs of each individual and then swabs are often in short supply.
