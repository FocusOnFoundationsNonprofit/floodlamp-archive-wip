#### 1. Expanding Access to High-Volume COVID-19 Diagnostic Testing

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the high-volume manufacturing standards required for point-of-care and home COVID-19 tests to qualify for FDA prioritization?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA prioritizes high-volume manufacturing standards for point-of-care and home COVID-19 tests, ensuring extensive distribution across numerous sites like CLIA labs and households. Developers should contact the FDA to confirm if their technology meets these high-volume considerations.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the high-volume manufacturing standards required for point-of-care and home COVID-19 tests to qualify for FDA prioritization?
VERBATIM ANSWER: I just wanted to again go over some key current priorities. As I mentioned, the importance for testing is ongoing, and the demand's ongoing. And so it's very important. And our key focus is to do anything we can to significantly expand access to testing through a high-volume test to support high-volume testing. And so that is the best use of our public resources, public health resources, is to focus our attention on that. And we're trying to stimulate development of those kinds of tests. So tests, particularly I would say diagnostic tests, in high-volume central lab tests systems that can run through a ton of samples in a shift, and they're manufactured in high volume. And then point of care and home tests, so diagnostic tests that, by virtue of their higher distribution, being performed in a lot more sites than, say, a high complexity lab, tens of thousands of CLIA waived labs and hundreds of thousands actually of CLIA waived labs and obviously potentially tens or hundreds of millions of home sites. And so to supply those over 100,000 point of care labs and as many households there are in the United States, that does require a high manufacturing volume of point-of-care tests and in-home tests. So for those that want to know if they qualify and meet the high volume considerations, they can reach out to the FDA and ask if their technology will meet that.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: High-volume COVID-19 test manufacturing, FDA prioritization, Point-of-care/home tests

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What flexibility does the FDA provide for including other viruses in diagnostic panels submitted for EUA?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA's EUA provisions target SARS but allow submission of diagnostic panels including other viruses, prioritizing those produced and tested in high volumes.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What flexibility does the FDA provide for including other viruses in diagnostic panels submitted for EUA?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Of course, the target is SARS. That's what the EUA provisions are for. They aren't for other viruses, but we have-- obviously, the FDA has shown a good deal of flexibility to allow other viruses and panels to be submitted to the FDA. And those panels when produced in high volume are able to be tested in labs in high volume do remain a priority.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: How does the EUA likely benefits versus likely risks standard change as new variants of SARS-CoV-2 emerge?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA's standard of weighing likely benefits versus likely risks for EUA authorization evolves as the virus mutates, though no drastic changes have occurred.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How does the EUA likely benefits versus likely risks standard change as new variants of SARS-CoV-2 emerge?
VERBATIM ANSWER: As we move through the pandemic and as the virus mutates and new variants show up and others recede, this balance between likely benefit versus likely risk can alter. And so that is a fluid sort of bar that we apply going forward. It hasn't changed drastically, but it does enter into our thinking. It is the standard that we use for making authorization decisions.

VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the current timeline for transcript posting from FDA town hall meetings, and how is it being addressed?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Also, we have recently obviously switched to a new platform, the Zoom platform, and there are clear advantages to it. But in moving over to this platform, we have had a challenge of dealing with transcript generation. And the awesome team that we have here at the FDA has been working on that, and we are working as hard and quickly as we can to restore the previous timelines for posting transcripts after calls. And we do see a light at the end of the tunnel and hopefully in the relatively near future. So in the interim, we do ask for your patience until we get back to those previous timelines for transcript posting.

#### 2. EUA Prioritization for Multiplexed Molecular Assay Authorization

QA Block 2-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is it possible to request an EUA for over-the-counter use of a multiplexed molecular assay that includes Flu A, Flu B, and COVID?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA has not authorized over-the-counter flu tests under EUA or traditional pathways due to a lack of need for asymptomatic influenza screening. While EUA submissions for multiplex molecular assays are considered, they are currently only for prescription use, not over-the-counter.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is it possible to request an EUA for over-the-counter use of a multiplexed molecular assay that includes Flu A, Flu B, and COVID?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The first question is about an EUA for a multiplexed molecular assay that includes Flu A, Flu B, and COVID and specifically asking if it's possible to request an EUA for over-the-counter use of a multiplexed molecular assay. And as Tim indicated, we do prioritize multiplex, multi-analyte panels when they're sufficiently high volume, but we have not currently authorized any tests either under EUA or traditional marketing pathways for over-the-counter flu tests. And that's because there's just generally not a need to screen asymptomatic individuals for influenza. So Tim was talking about the benefit-risk calculations that we take a look at, that impacts the benefit-risk calculation. So for flu tests, we have not determined that there is a benefit to over- the-counter flu tests. So that means that while we are considering multi-analyte panels for EUA, we are not currently doing so for over-the-counter. We are reviewing and authorizing over-the-counter tests for SARS-CoV-2 under EUA because there is a need for asymptomatic screening for COVID-19. But for multi-analyte tests, we are generally just considering prescription use tests since they're only needed for symptomatic individuals or those otherwise suspected of infection.

QA Block 2-5
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Why are EUA multi-analyte panel requests being limited to prescription use instead of over-the-counter?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA limits EUA multi-analyte panel tests to prescription use because there is no demonstrated need for over-the-counter flu testing, as flu screening is not required for asymptomatic individuals. Multi-analyte tests are primarily useful for symptomatic or suspected individuals.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Why are EUA multi-analyte panel requests being limited to prescription use instead of over-the-counter?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We do prioritize multiplex, multi-analyte panels when they're sufficiently high volume, but we have not currently authorized any tests either under EUA or traditional marketing pathways for over-the-counter flu tests.

#### 9. Evaluating Antigen Tests for COVID-19 Variant Impacts

QA Block 9-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Which COVID-19 variants require verification when applying for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA requires testing with the current circulating variant during clinical studies and an assessment of sequenced variants and mutations for potential impacts. Additional testing may be recommended for variants of concern if specific issues are identified.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Which COVID-19 variants require verification when applying for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Antigen test, OK. Well, when you do your clinical studies, if they're happening concurrently with your development and just prior to your submission, you're going to be testing the current circulating variant, and we don't necessarily ask you to identify which variant. But if the test performs well with the current contemporaneous variant that are circulating during the time of the clinical study, that gives us an idea at least for what's currently circulating the performance if it was adequate or not. But we do also want you to do an assessment of sequenced variants and mutations and the potential impact of those on your test. And you can use bioinformatics to help you. For an antigen test, knowing the epitope mapping for your antibodies and/or knowing the antigen that was used to raise your antibodies can give you a clue as to whether or not you should do any subsequent at least in silico investigation of potential impacts. And for any potential impacts that you identify or the FDA identifies, we may recommend some wet testing of those variants to make sure that you don't have a performance issue.

Verification should ensure the test remains accurate across known variants.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What specific verification is needed for a test when applying for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)?

And for any potential impacts that you identify or the FDA identifies, we may recommend some wet testing of those variants to make sure that you don't have a performance issue. And that wet testing could be if the specific invariant or variants of concern are present in, say, BEI Repository and have an activated virus and that functions in your assay, that's one potential pathway. Another potential pathway is to obtain residual samples that have been sequenced so we know what the mutations and variants are. And there are some labs out there that are routinely doing sequencing and have banked samples or can sequence the samples for you. And that should help you determine whether or not there is a real issue with your antigen test.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What does the FDA mean by 'assessment of sequenced variants and mutations' for antigen tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA requires an assessment of sequenced variants and mutations to evaluate their impact on antigen tests. Using bioinformatics, epitope mapping, or investigating antibody antigens can help identify potential issues. If issues are found, wet testing with sequenced residual samples or repositories may be recommended. Determining variant impacts is a high priority involving agencies like the FDA, CDC, NIH, and RADx.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What does the FDA mean by 'assessment of sequenced variants and mutations' for antigen tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Antigen test, OK. Well, when you do your clinical studies, if they're happening concurrently with your development and just prior to your submission, you're going to be testing the current circulating variant, and we don't necessarily ask you to identify which variant. But if the test performs well with the current contemporaneous variant that are circulating during the time of the clinical study, that gives us an idea at least for what's currently circulating the performance if it was adequate or not. But we do also want you to do an assessment of sequenced variants and mutations and the potential impact of those on your test. And you can use bioinformatics to help you. For an antigen test, knowing the epitope mapping for your antibodies and/or knowing the antigen that was used to raise your antibodies can give you a clue as to whether or not you should do any subsequent at least in silico investigation of potential impacts. And for any potential impacts that you identify or the FDA identifies, we may recommend some wet testing of those variants to make sure that you don't have a performance issue. And that wet testing could be if the specific invariant or variants of concern are present in, say, BEI Repository and have an activated virus and that functions in your assay, that's one potential pathway. Another potential pathway is to obtain residual samples that have been sequenced so we know what the mutations and variants are. And there are some labs out there that are routinely doing sequencing and have banked samples or can sequence the samples for you. And that should help you determine whether or not there is a real issue with your antigen test. But this is a high priority to determine the potential impact of variants of mutations on all tests, EUA tests. It's an ongoing activity at the FDA, the CDC, and of course, NIH and RADx, and we've been working really closely together along with the developers of tests to assess impact. So hopefully, that more than addresses your question.

#### 10. FDA Guidance on Home Test Kit Requirements

QA Block 10-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How is the FDA differentiating between low volume and high volume regarding the quantity of tests allowed in a non-lab test kit?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA differentiates low and high volume based on manufacturing capabilities for US distribution rather than kit size or throughput. Current thresholds are unpublished to allow flexibility.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How is the FDA differentiating between low volume and high volume regarding the quantity of tests allowed in a non-lab test kit?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah, for home tests, if it's authorized for a single test in a kit, there are various options there and pathways depending on performance and what studies you've done where a single rapid antigen test in a home kit is sufficient. However, where the authorization comes with a serial testing claim say for screening, then we want to see at least two tests in a kit. So the high volume for that situation, same goes for point of care, isn't the kit size or the throughput of the particular test because these are more manual point of care and rapid antigen tests at home. And a given individual can only perform so many of these tests in an hour, and it's pretty low volume. So what we do when we look at that is we look at your manufacturing capability and how many of these tests can you produce, manufacture for US distribution in a given amount of time. And those thresholds, we haven't publicly announced. We may, but right now, we're not because we want to remain responsive to the current situations, and that can change. So we don't want to set a bar publicly necessarily, and then have to go and change it more formally later. So it gives maximum flexibility.

VERBATIM QUESTION: At what size of a home-use test kit would a control, such as control swabs, be required?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah, we set the minimum number for recommended kit size based on the use. So again, if it's a single-use application, it only needs one test. If it's serial testing for antigen test, it needs two. And as far as external controls go in the home environment, we are not recommending that you actually have that. I mean, if your test requires for continued good performance to have external controls run, there could be some devices that require periodic calibration and/or check up calibration, that's more challenging in the home environment. And so it's ideal if you don't need those external controls. And of course, for waived labs point of care, there are monthly quality control requirements, and for those professional use tests, we do like to see that controls are available for the professional use so the folks in those environments don't have to go try to find a source for control to meet their CLIA requirements.

#### 11. Evaluating COVID-19 Tests for Delta Variant Effectiveness

QA Block 11-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can commercially available COVID-19 tests detect the Delta variant?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA monitors COVID-19 tests for performance against variants, including Delta, and currently has no significant concerns. Tests authorized under EUA are performing adequately, with no notable sensitivity loss due to mutations or variants.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can commercially available COVID-19 tests detect the Delta variant?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah, so let me just go through our process that we use. So first of all, through safety communications, we have asked developers to engage in this along with us, and we don't want it to fall entirely to the FDA or the US government, but the US government has stepped up, and because we've been asked by the US government to make sure, ensure that the EUA authorized tests are still performing in the face of mutations and variants. And so on a weekly basis, we download the most recent sequences. We have all the proprietary primers and probes and other details about other types of tests like antigen tests, and we do our own bioinformatics search across all the tests and identify potential issues. We have a scale for determining whether it reaches the level in which we want to investigate further. And then if we do, we engage CDC and NIH RADx. And they try to source samples, and they try to obtain the tests to perform the actual test, particularly for antigen tests in NIH RADx labs. In addition, we do reach out to sponsors at that point, developers to do their own and for us to ask questions and for them to get back to us. And we do ask them to get back to us in a very timely way. And as soon as we have any sort of confirmed findings, we've been erring on the side of caution and posting results on the FDA website. But we do maintain a variant mutation website. Currently, there's only four tests listed there, and actually, none of those four have demonstrated a loss of sensitivity of 5% or greater, which we're currently defining as a significant decrease, for any of the variants of concern and for any mutation in the US or combination of mutation that reach the 5% or above level. So that's the good news, but we do have ongoing active investigations of potential issues. Fortunately, none are active for any of the tests that we would consider super high volume tests, and these are the super high volume rapid antigen tests, and we could come up with the list easily of the handful that are in that category, and you read about them the time, and also for the central lab test. So we do subdivide by whether it's lower volume, relatively lower volumes, moderate volumes, and high volume. Some of that is market penetration, too, as we're looking at how we grade the potential risk for the US testing activities, not that we don't investigate lower risk, but we want to be able to provide that kind of dashboard on a weekly basis to all our partner federal agencies. So the good news is for Delta nor for any other mutation or variant do we have any significant concerns at this moment.

QA Block 11-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What process does the FDA use to monitor whether EUA authorized tests are impacted by new variants?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA uses a rigorous process to monitor whether EUA-authorized tests are impacted by new variants. They analyze weekly sequence data, use bioinformatics to evaluate potential issues, and collaborate with CDC, NIH RADx, and developers for additional evaluation. Observations and results are shared on the FDA website, including maintaining a variant-mutation site.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What process does the FDA use to monitor whether EUA authorized tests are impacted by new variants?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah, so let me just go through our process that we use. So first of all, through safety communications, we have asked developers to engage in this along with us, and we don't want it to fall entirely to the FDA or the US government, but the US government has stepped up, and because we've been asked by the US government to make sure, ensure that the EUA authorized tests are still performing in the face of mutations and variants. And so on a weekly basis, we download the most recent sequences. We have all the proprietary primers and probes and other details about other types of tests like antigen tests, and we do our own bioinformatics search across all the tests and identify potential issues. We have a scale for determining whether it reaches the level in which we want to investigate further. And then if we do, we engage CDC and NIH RADx. And they try to source samples, and they try to obtain the tests to perform the actual test, particularly for antigen tests in NIH RADx labs. In addition, we do reach out to sponsors at that point, developers to do their own and for us to ask questions and for them to get back to us. And we do ask them to get back to us in a very timely way. And as soon as we have any sort of confirmed findings, we've been erring on the side of caution and posting results on the FDA website. But we do maintain a variant mutation website. Currently, there's only four tests listed there, and actually, none of those four have demonstrated a loss of sensitivity of 5% or greater, which we're currently defining as a significant decrease, for any of the variants of concern and for any mutation in the US or combination of mutation that reach the 5% or above level.

This helps ensure the accuracy, especially in cases of low-target tests potentially affected by rare mutations.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What measures should developers take if a diagnostic test result does not align with clinical perceptions?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We do continue to urge and recommend that for anyone performing testing, if they get a result particularly for a diagnostic test that doesn't match their clinical perceptions of what might be going on, that they reflex to another test, particularly a different test and particularly a different molecular test if the original test is molecular to confirm whether or not that original test result is accurate because any given test could, depending on whether it's three targets, two targets, or one target test, could have an issue, particularly the lower target test could have an issue with what I call a private mutation that isn't reaching significant levels, but obviously, it's critical for understanding what's going on with that patient.

QA Block 4-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Do a certain number of the 30 positives have to come from participants using paper instructions versus the smartphone app for home-use antigen assays?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA expects 30 positives and 30 negatives for visual interpretation and another 30 positives and 30 negatives for app interpretation, as the two methods may result in different performance. Usability for both methods is also expected.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Do a certain number of the 30 positives have to come from participants using paper instructions versus the smartphone app for home-use antigen assays?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So generally, for a situation like that, we would expect to see 30 positives and 30 negatives for visual interpretation and another 30 positive and 30 negative for the app interpretation since those two methods may lead to significantly different performance. And we would also expect to see usability for both approaches.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: clinical evaluation, home-use antigen assays, distribution of positives
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 4-5
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Should usability testing be conducted separately for visual interpretation and smartphone app interpretation in home-use antigen tests?

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What specific risks are associated with over-the-counter multi-analyte tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA believes the risks of over-the-counter multi-analyte tests outweigh the benefits. They recommend restricting such tests to prescription use to ensure proper interpretation of results and appropriate actions with healthcare professional involvement.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What specific risks are associated with over-the-counter multi-analyte tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We generally do not think that the benefits of an over-the-counter multi-analyte test outweigh the risks. So we would limit the multi-analyte tests to prescription use since health care professional involvement is generally needed to ensure that test results are interpreted correctly and that appropriate action is taken.

QA Block 8-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the FDA's process for handling the increasing volume of Q-sub and Presub submissions?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is working on addressing the increasing volume of Q-subs and Presubs by aiming for succinct responses, focusing on unique aspects, and updating molecular test templates to minimize submission needs and feedback delays. They also request patience due to their ongoing high workload.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the FDA's process for handling the increasing volume of Q-sub and Presub submissions?
VERBATIM ANSWER: And I would also add, I mean, we are starting to get an increasing volume of Q-subs, Presubs for full authorizations. When it's a molecular test, we've already made one decision, and so it would be hopefully the decision summary has been posted already. I don't know. But we do have recommendations. So by and large, we hope that you get everything you need from that. And so because of the growing volume of Q-subs, Presubs, we are going to aim to probably be fairly succinct in our responses and focus on anything that might be unique. And we ask your patience with this because of the high volume. We're still getting more than 100 EUA applications a month, and obviously, we're still working on all our non-COVID work as well. And then, we're going to endeavor to update the templates for molecular serology and antigen tests to make it very clear what the recommendations are for conversion and upcharge the team to make that a high priority now to make that available. I can't promise when. But then, it should minimize the need for Presubs and Q-subs and minimize any timelines for getting feedback from the FDA. But in essence, we by and large, especially for molecular, have recommendations. We can provide our general recommendations pretty quickly. And then only if there are unique specific questions that we're focusing on working on.
