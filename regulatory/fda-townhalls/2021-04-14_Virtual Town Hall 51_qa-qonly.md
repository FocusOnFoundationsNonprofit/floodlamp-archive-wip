#### 1. FDA Updates on SARS-CoV-2 Test Authorizations

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What distinguishes over-the-counter COVID-19 tests from those requiring a prescription?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Over-the-counter COVID-19 tests, like the Lucira Check It, are intended for single-use at-home screening, whereas the same test was previously authorized only for use with a prescription.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What distinguishes over-the-counter COVID-19 tests from those requiring a prescription?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Last week we authorized the Lucira Check It COVID-19 tests for over-the-counter use for single use at-home screening tests. And this one was previously authorized for prescription home testing.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: Over-the-counter vs prescription tests, COVID-19 diagnostics
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What defines a reissue of a letter of authorization versus a revised EUA under the FDA's procedures?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: A 'reissue' involves changes to the letter of authorization, such as updating intended use or conditions, whereas a 'revised' EUA refers to granting letters used for updates requiring FDA concurrence, often for changes to labeling.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What defines a reissue of a letter of authorization versus a revised EUA under the FDA's procedures?
VERBATIM ANSWER: If it says that it is a reissue that means that we reissued the letter of authorization and that's generally used for updates that change any of the details in the letter of authorization including updating the intended use and the conditions of authorization, et cetera. And then revised generally means that we issued what we refer to as granting letters. So those are the letters that you'll see if you expand the little plus sign on the EUA list and that will be letters that we grant to update some details about the EUA. And those are generally used for updates that require FDA  concurrence such as changing to labeling or changes to labeling but they don't impact the letter of authorization.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: reissue of authorization, revised EUA, FDA terminology
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Under what circumstances does the FDA issue granting letters for EUAs?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Granting letters are issued for updates to EUAs that require FDA concurrence, such as labeling changes, but do not affect the letter of authorization.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Under what circumstances does the FDA issue granting letters for EUAs?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Revised generally means that we issued what we refer to as granting letters. So those are the letters that you'll see if you expand the little plus sign on the EUA list and that will be letters that we grant to update some details about the EUA. And those are generally used for updates that require FDA concurrence such as changing to labeling or changes to labeling but they don't impact the letter of authorization.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: granting letters, EUA updates, labeling changes
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What types of changes to test labeling require FDA concurrence?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA concurrence is required for revised updates to labeling, which are issued through granting letters and involve changes to EUA details without impacting the letter of authorization.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What types of changes to test labeling require FDA concurrence?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Revised generally means that we issued what we refer to as granting letters. So those are the letters that you'll see if you expand the little plus sign on the EUA list and that will be letters that we grant to update some details about the EUA. And those are generally used for updates that require FDA  concurrence such as changing to labeling or changes to labeling but they don't impact the letter of authorization.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: FDA concurrence, Test labeling changes, EUA updates
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-5
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How does the FDA categorize updates to EUAs that involve minor changes, such as fixing typos?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA classifies updates to EUAs involving minor changes, such as fixing typos or minor clarifications, as 'updated' in emails. These updates involve posting new labeling without reissuing the letter of authorization or issuing a granting letter.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How does the FDA categorize updates to EUAs that involve minor changes, such as fixing typos?
VERBATIM ANSWER: And then if the email says updated then that is referring to updates to labeling where we might have posted new labeling without issuing any letters. So without reissuing the letter of authorization and without issuing a granting letter. And that's usually used for minor changes to the labeling fixing typos, minor clarifications, things that are generally not substantive to the performance of the test or don't involve evaluation of new data.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: EUA updates, Minor changes, Labeling clarifications
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-6
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the significance of adding reference panel result data to the test labeling according to the FDA?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Adding reference panel results to test labeling provides updated information but does not typically involve reissuing or granting new letters of authorization.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the significance of adding reference panel result data to the test labeling according to the FDA?
VERBATIM ANSWER: And then we also use that updated labeling when we are adding results from the reference panel to the labeling of the test.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE

#### 3. Transition Plan for EUA Devices and Regulatory Pathways

QA Block 3-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the timeline for transitioning from EUAs to 510(k)s or De Novos for COVID-19 diagnostics?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA cannot specify a timeline for transitioning from EUAs to 510(k)s or De Novos but is working on a transition plan, which is listed as FY21 priority guidance. EUAs remain active until the public health emergency ends, which historically is not accelerated. A first test was authorized for marketing outside the emergency (BioFire De Novo), opening the 510(k) route for other tests, but no immediate changes to EUAs are planned.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the timeline for transitioning from EUAs to 510(k)s or De Novos for COVID-19 diagnostics?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Next we have a question about the process and timing to discontinue EUAs and require 510k's or Denovos. And we have discussed this a little bit previously on calls. And we've mentioned before that I can't comment on a timeline specifically but we are working on a transition plan for devices that are offered under EUA. And this is included as a guidance document on the center's guidance priority list for FY21. If you take a look there you'll see the transition plan for medical devices distributed under enforcement policies or emergency's authorization during the COVID-19 public health emergency. Additionally it's important to recognize that generally unless they're revoked an EUA is in effect until the public health emergency is terminated. And the termination of a public health emergency does not typically happen on a particularly accelerated timeline. You can see that there are previous public health emergencies, like, Zika and Ebola that still have not been terminated. Now we have authorized the first test for marketing beyond the public health emergency with the BioFire Denovo. And that does open up the 510k pathway for other molecular diagnostic SARS-CoV-2 tests both individual or a single analyte SARS-CoV-2 test as well as multi-analyte panels which the Bio Fire test is. But that Denovo does not impact any other EUAs other than the BioFire EUA for that same identical test which was revoked concurrent to granting the Denovo. BioFire's other EUAs and other developer's EUAs were not impacted. So we can't anticipate when the public health emergency would end but we are working on that transition plan and we are committed to, you know,  ensuring that the public has access to a wide variety of test options for COVID-19 and we have no intention at the moment of stopping review for EUAs or revoking based solely on timeline or anything, like, that.

QA Block 3-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the process to transition from EUAs to 510(k)s or De Novos for COVID-19 diagnostics?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is working on a transition plan for devices offered under EUAs, included in the FY21 guidance priority list. EUAs remain in effect until the public health emergency ends, which usually does not happen quickly. The FDA has authorized a De Novo for BioFire, opening up the 510(k) pathway for similar SARS-CoV-2 tests. This process does not immediately impact other existing EUAs, and the FDA remains committed to reviewing EUAs as needed.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the process to transition from EUAs to 510(k)s or De Novos for COVID-19 diagnostics?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We have discussed this a little bit previously on calls. And we've mentioned before that I can't comment on a timeline specifically but we are working on a transition plan for devices that are offered under EUA. And this is included as a guidance document on the center's guidance priority list for FY21. If you take a look there you'll see the transition plan for medical devices distributed under enforcement policies or emergency's authorization during the COVID-19 public health emergency. Additionally it's important to recognize that generally unless they're revoked an EUA is in effect until the public health emergency is terminated. And the termination of a public health emergency does not typically happen on a particularly accelerated timeline. You can see that there are previous public health emergencies, like, Zika and Ebola that still have not been terminated. Now we have authorized the first test for marketing beyond the public health emergency with the BioFire Denovo. And that does open up the 510k pathway for other molecular diagnostic SARS-CoV-2 tests both individual or a single analyte SARS-CoV-2 test as well as multi-analyte panels which the Bio Fire test is. But that Denovo does not impact any other EUAs other than the BioFire EUA for that same identical test which was revoked concurrent to granting the Denovo. BioFire's other EUAs and other developer's EUAs were not impacted.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is there any indication on review priorities for SARS-CoV-2 pre-submissions?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA continues to review SARS-CoV-2 pre-submissions during the pandemic, prioritizing reviews based on public health needs and specifics of the device.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is there any indication on review priorities for SARS-CoV-2 pre-submissions?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We have obviously seen delays in CDRH on pre-submission and 510k reviews during the pandemic. So this question is asking whether that applies - if a pre-sub is submitted for a SARS-CoV-2 assay that does not currently have an EUA authorization. So generally we are broadly committed to ensuring that the public has access to a wide variety of test options for COVID-19 and we do intend to continue to review SARS-CoV-2 pre-submissions to address public health needs. So to some extent - so COVID-19 related pre-submissions are one of the categories of pre-submissions that we do continue to review. And the review of those would be prioritized based on the public health needs. So we would still consider the particulars about the device in question as to whether it would be a priority with you.

VERBATIM QUESTION: What does the FDA mean by "product branding information" in the context of EUA submissions?
VERBATIM ANSWER: That may depend on exactly what you mean by product branding information. But generally we do review the labeling. And so that would probably include the product branding that you're referring to. We do usually include in the EUA a condition about adding labeling where, you know, for distributors that might distribute under a different name. And that's something that can be added after the initial authorization if you're looking to partner with different distributors. But the testing is included in the authorization and the, you know, name obviously would go on the labeling that we would review and authorize as part of the EUA.
