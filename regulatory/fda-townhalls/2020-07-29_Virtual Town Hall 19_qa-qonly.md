CLARIFIED QUESTION: What specific regulatory considerations apply to the validation and reporting of pooling results?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA welcomes pooling and expects labs to validate their pooling following FDA guidelines. Once validated, labs may notify FDA and start pooling tests while submitting data within 15 business days, continuing testing unless any issues arise.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What specific regulatory considerations apply to the validation and reporting of pooling results?
VERBATIM ANSWER: I want to just briefly review pooling, and just make sure that everybody on the call today knows that we welcome pooling. With the template updates, we've provided even more information on pooling that find, we hope, to be helpful. Nothing really has changed in what our recommendations are for validation. But I do want to clarify the regulatory pathway for pooling. As we have seen highly variable results, even on the same platforms in different labs. We believe that the science here is still evolving. And we would like to be involved in the pooling. However, we've made it very regulatory friendly. That is, go ahead and validate your pool. We ask that you follow the recommendations if not, and contact us. But once you've validated the pooling, and if you follow our recommendations, you don't even, you know, need to have contact with us. Validate it. Once you validate it you can start pooling while you work on pulling the data together and submit it to us within 15 business days. We would ask that you notify us, as well, when you begin that pooling testing, and that you've finished validation, so we can be on the lookout for your data when it comes in. And then after you submit, and during that whole time, you can continue to test. As long as you don't experience any issues. And we'll receive it. I'll take a quick look at it. We'll assign it to a staff member. If we have any concerns we'll reach out. But all during this time, unless you hear from us, you can continue to test.

QA Block 1-12
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the technical details of Quest's updated testing method and its impact on throughput capacity?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Quest updated its LDT testing method by introducing a new extraction method, enabling an additional 36,000 tests per day. Coupled with pooling, this significantly boosts throughput.
VERBATIM QUESTION: IMPLICIT
VERBATIM ANSWER: You may have seen yesterday, an amendment update for Quest testing - their LDT testing. They submitted a new extraction method that gives them greater throughput. Normally we don't make these updates that big a deal, although they're all important to all the developers. But the new update allows Quest to test 36,000 - that's 36K or 36,000 more tests - up to, more tests per day. And then if you add pooling on top of that, which they're already authorized to do pooling, then they can substantially increase the throughput.

#### 2. Minimum Sample Size for Serological Test Validation

QA Block 2-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can we test five individuals and get 100% sensitivity for IgM results?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The minimum sample size for IgM results is 30 positive samples per isotype. Additional samples may be needed if IgM and IgG results are not completely aligned.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can we test five individuals and get 100% sensitivity for IgM results?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, that's a great question. Happy to clarify. Yes, it's a minimum of 30 positives per isotype. If all the samples are positive for both IgM and IgG, obviously all you need is 30 samples. But if there's not complete alignment between IgE and IgM, for example, then you may need to go above that 30. But as IgM is coming up just about the same time as IgG comes up, in most of these patients, hopefully, that's roughly about 30 samples. Thirty positive samples total. Hopefully, that addresses your question.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Shannon Clark
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: IgM sensitivity, sample size, serological tests
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 2-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is the minimum sample size for IgM results 30 subjects?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The minimum sample size for IgM results is 30 positive samples per isotype. If there isn't alignment between isotypes, more samples may be required.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is the minimum sample size for IgM results 30 subjects?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, that's a great question. Happy to clarify. Yes, it's a minimum of 30 positives per isotype.

REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 2-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: For serology testing, is the required sample size 30 positive and 30 negative samples, or 15 positive and 15 negative samples?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: For serology testing, 30 positive samples are required and a minimum of 75 negative samples, though additional negatives are often used to improve specificity and predictive value estimates.
VERBATIM QUESTION: For serology testing, is the required sample size 30 positive and 30 negative samples, or 15 positive and 15 negative samples?
VERBATIM ANSWER: For serology it's 30 positive. And then a minimum of - Toby correct me, of 75 negative. But it also depends on the cross-reactivity testing that you do. There are different formulas there, depending on how you do your negatives. Many developers are doing a whole lot more negatives so that they have a better estimate. And we have - it's not a requirement, but they do it to have a better estimate of what their negative percent agreement, is. And so we know what - in general, what the specificity is so that we can, you know, we know what positive predictive values will be. And negative predictive values will be for these serology tests.

QA Block 2-5
CLARIFIED QUESTION: In point-of-care testing, must we simulate sample collection using a lancet, or can leftover samples previously collected be used for testing?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is open to using leftover samples previously collected for point-of-care testing but recommends consulting their expert review staff on stabilizing and validating such samples.
VERBATIM QUESTION: In point-of-care testing, must we simulate sample collection using a lancet, or can leftover samples previously collected be used for testing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, we're open to that. I'm not familiar with how you would stabilize the finger prick sample for very long. And so I think that kind of detail would require a little bit of dialogue with our expert review staff on how to make sure that that's going to work well for you.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Shannon Clark
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: point-of-care testing, sample collection, FDA consultation

TOPICS: finger prick sample stability, point-of-care testing procedures
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 2-9
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How should developers address differences in test results caused by variations in sample collection methods (e.g., finger prick versus venipuncture)?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA considers venipuncture and finger prick as different sample types due to physiological differences. For such differences, developers should provide data showing no impact on results or discuss this with the FDA. Authorization depends on data accuracy.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How should developers address differences in test results caused by variations in sample collection methods (e.g., finger prick versus venipuncture)?
VERBATIM ANSWER: For those who might have a similar question, we do view venipuncture and finger prick as different sample types. And then because they are not physiologically the same, with the venipuncture you have good mixing of all components in the blood. In a finger stick, you can have alteration of that. All right? Thank you. And I think to add on to that, if your samples that you're using were not collected in the manner in which you intend to collect them for use of your test, we would need to discuss that with you. And consider, you know, whether you have any data to demonstrate that - the difference in collection methods does not change your results. Yes, good point Toby. And, to make sure that you don't carry that way of collecting and storing into your authorization. Because we can only authorize, what we have data to authorize.

#### 3. Saliva Collection Devices and EUA Authorization Process

QA Block 3-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: If the maker of a saliva collection device is themselves a CLIA lab, using a test that already has EUA authorization, can they use that test with their collection device to submit a new EUA application?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Yes, the FDA allows saliva collection devices to submit their own EUA for authorization, even if they are part of a test system authorized under EUA. Other tests can then leverage such authorization for their own EUAs.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If the maker of a saliva collection device is themselves a CLIA lab, using a test that already has EUA authorization, can they use that test with their collection device to submit a new EUA application?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, so I'm not sure I followed all of the pieces there, but let me, you know, start from you know, sort of the basics with collection devices. So collection devices we do consider to be devices. And we do review them, you know, generally both before and during the pandemic, as standalone devices. During the public health emergency, specifically for saliva collection devices, we do want to ensure that they have been appropriately validated. And we can do that in a couple of ways. We have authorized tests that include specific collection devices. And so in those cases the collection device is considered part of the test system and is authorized as such. That does not mean that those collection devices have an authorization. They are only authorized within that EUA as a system. Collection devices can also submit their own EUA to get their own authorization, similar to how we've authorized a couple of standalone home collection kits. We can do that both for home collection and not. Such that the collection device itself would have an authorization. And then other tests can leverage that authorization and incorporate it into their EUA. So a test could request in their EUA, to be authorized for use with that previously authorized collection device.

TOPICS: Saliva Collection Device, EUA Application, Regulatory Requirements
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 3-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can a test authorized without a collection device use its EUA authorized test with a new collection device for holistic validation?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: EUA-authorized tests without a collection device can use a new collection device for holistic validation, but devices like saliva collection require pre-market review, whereas standard swabs are usually exempt from review.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can a test authorized without a collection device use its EUA authorized test with a new collection device for holistic validation?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Right. So right now a lot of tests are authorized, you know, with sort of what we would consider, standard respiratory specimens. Like NP swabs and nasal swabs. And those swabs also are devices that have regulatory requirements for them. Most of them are 510k exempt, meaning that we don't need to review them. We would just expect them to follow, you know, the other regulatory requirements like registration and listing and adverse event reporting and whatnot. But we wouldn't need to see a submission for them. And then other collection devices like saliva collection devices, do generally require pre-market review. And so during the emergency, we are considering EUAs for them.

#### 4. Authorization and Regulation of Serology Tests for Point-of-Care Use

QA Block 4-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are manufacturers or distributors allowed to sell their antibody tests to non-CLIA-certified locations, such as doctor's offices or chiropractors?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA has not authorized serology tests for non-CLIA-certified locations like doctor's offices or chiropractors. All current authorized serology tests are for CLIA-certified high or moderate complexity labs. Authorization is required for non-laboratory-based use.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are manufacturers or distributors allowed to sell their antibody tests to non-CLIA-certified locations, such as doctor's offices or chiropractors?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, we have not - unfortunately, we have not yet had a complete package that we could - until - and maybe there's something inhouse now. But we haven't had a complete package to - giving authorization to a point-of-care, CLIA-waived - deemed CLIA-waived serology test. We're very open to it. We just ask the developers, you know, follow our recommendations or they're going to want to do something else to connect with us. We're all on board. And then we get the data in, we look at it.

#### 5. Validation Requirements for PBS as Specimen Transport Medium

QA Block 5-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: If PBS is used for specimen collection in a global health setting, do tests need to be revalidated with PBS as a transport medium?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA's requirements depend on the context. If a lab adds PBS for healthcare use without involving non-traditional settings, no FDA authorization is needed. Kit manufacturers claiming PBS should validate, notify FDA, and submit data within 15 days. In non-traditional settings (e.g., home collections), PBS can be used if stability studies like those by the Gates Foundation are referenced.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If PBS is used for specimen collection in a global health setting, do tests need to be revalidated with PBS as a transport medium?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So well from a regulatory perspective how the FDA views this depends. So if it's a lab and they simply want to add PBS or normal saline to what they give their users - their healthcare worker users to use, but it doesn't involve like non-traditional settings like the home, no FDA authorization is required. If it's a kit manufacturer and they want to claim a normal saline or PBS in their kit they can validate, notify us and send validation data just within 15 business days, to include that into their kit. And then of course in the non-traditional collection or testing situation - let's talk about collections. The Gates Foundation in partnership with others -- and I'm blanking on all the names -- did validate normal saline. And I forget if they also did PBS. But we pretty much view those as very similar in the non-traditional collection, i.e. home, and did some stability studies in saline. And any developers that want to utilize that data of the Gates Foundation and their partners, is allowed a right of reference to use that for other applications, as may apply.

#### 8. FDA Guidance on Point-of-Care Testing and Telemedicine

QA Block 8-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Has the FDA had discussions about potential problems with using non-CLIA waived serology tests paired with technology transmitting data to high-complexity CLIA labs for point-of-care settings?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA stated that non-CLIA waived serology tests cannot be used in CLIA waived settings unless they've undergone the necessary point-of-care testing validation by lay users. Telemedicine might serve as a risk mitigation strategy but cannot address all validation risks. Developers are directed to follow point-of-care validation guidelines from FDA templates for serology, molecular, and antigen tests.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Has the FDA had discussions about potential problems with using non-CLIA waived serology tests paired with technology transmitting data to high-complexity CLIA labs for point-of-care settings?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So, if the device in question only has a high-complexity designation, all of the testing has to be performed by high-complexity lab, as far as I know. However, as that CLIA certificate allows. So, there's potentially close-to-patient situations that can be fast and appropriately monitored by a CLIA high-complexity lab that, you know, might be okay. Part of their point-of-care validation involves making sure that lay users, non-laboratory health professionals, can perform testing to get accurate results. So, those devices that haven't been deemed CLIA waived, should not be used in a CLIA waived environment and we would like to hear about those. And not entirely, I want to add to that. So, we - a device that, the FDA wouldn't view a device, that hasn't gone through all the point-of-care testing validation by non-laboratory personnel, would have concerns, personal concerns about that. But I think Toby's right and that CMS should be consulted. But from an FDA perspective, the appropriate flex studies for use by non-laboratory professionals, you know, a laboratory professional can pipette and we know that they can pipette that accurately. It's hard, by telemedicine, to know that the pipetting done somewhere else by non-laboratory personnel is done accurately, even via telemedicine. So, we appreciate all the creativity that's being applied to the situation, use of telemedicine is - in health, is greatly encouraged and there are appropriate uses. And sometimes because of the presence of telehealth and telemedicine, and the mitigations of the involvement that way, we can reduce some of the opportunities to validate. We can - it is a risk mitigation, but it doesn't necessarily mitigate all risks. So, we would point all developers to our serology template that has point-of-care validation information, and now the new molecular and the direct antigen test, have those studies as well on the template. And then a new - an update on the molecular update now has for molecular point-of-care recommendations for validations. So, validations performed that way are very important for situations where it's non-laboratory personnel carrying out testing.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Paul Joseph
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: non-CLIA waived serology tests, FDA validation requirements, telemedicine considerations
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 8-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Would the FDA be open to using such technologies or are there particular concerns?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA has concerns about using devices without thorough point-of-care validation by non-laboratory personnel. While telemedicine is encouraged and can mitigate some risks, it does not eliminate all risks. FDA refers developers to its serology templates and guidelines for point-of-care validations.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Would the FDA be open to using such technologies or are there particular concerns?
VERBATIM ANSWER: And not entirely, I want to add to that. So, we - a device that, the FDA wouldn't view a device, that hasn't gone through all the point-of-care testing validation by non-laboratory personnel, would have concerns, personal concerns about that. But I think Toby's right and that CMS should be consulted. But from an FDA perspective, the appropriate flex studies for use by non-laboratory professionals, you know, a laboratory professional can pipette and we know that they can pipette that accurately. It's hard, by telemedicine, to know that the pipetting done somewhere else by non-laboratory personnel is done accurately, even via telemedicine. So, we appreciate all the creativity that's being applied to the situation, use of telemedicine is - in health, is greatly encouraged and there are appropriate uses. And sometimes because of the presence of telehealth and telemedicine, and the mitigations of the involvement that way, we can reduce some of the opportunities to validate. We can - it is a risk mitigation, but it doesn't necessarily mitigate all risks. So, we would point all developers to our serology template that has point-of-care validation information, and now the new molecular and the direct antigen test, have those studies as well on the template. And then a new - an update on the molecular update now has for molecular point-of-care recommendations for validations. So, validations performed that way are very important for situations where it's non-laboratory personnel carrying out testing.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA aims to maintain flexibility regarding study designs and recommends communication with the FDA if adjustments to recommendations are needed. The agency supports moving towards actual POC samples and acknowledges challenges in obtaining fresh samples. FDA remains open to alternate approaches with proper consultation.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can FDA confirm that the study enrichment via enrollment with known positives is acceptable for a point-of-care (POC) use indication?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, well, we're trying to be consistent across the board. And as we evolve here, we want to maintain flexibility. Our recommendations in writing are, you know, are that, our recommendations. And if there's any particular technologies, there's any alterations to those recommendations, review, I encourage communication with the FDA to limit potential additional testing that may be necessary for an authorization. So, we understand that sometimes it's difficult to get samples. We've moved away from contrived samples for the most part and into actual POC samples.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Can a point-of-care clinical study screen first on another test to identify positive patients, and then enroll those patients for a focused study?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So, I think what you're saying is can - okay, I'm just trying to understand a bit. I think what you're saying is, in order to limit the size of the study, can you have a screen first on another test to know which patients are positive and then come in - and have those patients come in and be tested so that you can have a little bit more focused clinical study and design... as many people. So, we were - so, I understand now. As long as the comparative test is a good test. I don't see a huge amount of challenges with that. There are a couple things we'd want to make sure that the person that's re-testing the patient is not aware of the previous results. So, and, you know, and then once you bring those patients in and have the person performing the test be unaware, that is important. I think if they know those settings are going on and being recalled, then they would assume that patient was basically positive and they'll be looking for the positive results on that patient and we don't want to do this bias in this study, so that's important to control that balance and that's the sort of thing that you can discuss with the FDA.

#### 13. Pooling Strategies and FDA Guidance for Testing Efficiency

QA Block 13-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the FDA's stance on allowing pooling at larger sizes if an algorithm can account for possible lesser quality?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA does not limit pooling size to 5; it depends on validation and data. They allow various pooling methods, but the efficiency of complex pooling decreases as positivity rates rise. Combinatorial pooling works best with very low positivity.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the FDA's stance on allowing pooling at larger sizes if an algorithm can account for possible lesser quality?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We don't limit the pool size to 5. It all depends on the situation and the validity of the data, but if you're able to verify a larger pool. We also don't specify the type of pooling. We have provided a little bit more information say on, if you want to pool swabs rather than pool VTM, you can do simple Dorfman pooling. You can do matrix pooling as I believe - well, we've authorized, I think, some matrix pooling or, I think, thinking about if it's simple matrix where it's basically, you know, you just, you know, read the rows in the columns and you can identify the sample that way. There are also what I call more complex or combinatorial pooling which I think you're talking about. Realizing, though, that the more complicated the pooling is, particularly when you move into combinatorial pooling, the percent typically when you do it, that the percent positive efficiency goes down, right? So, if you want to maintain good efficiency on what you're - based on what your percent positives are in your population, it can go - it can go way down. So, I've seen some published, mainly theoretical papers on combinatorial pooling where really anything over 1.3 positivity in your population didn't justify that combinatorial pooling. So in the situation where we have very low percent positivity, those kind of pooling algorithms work best.

During the public health emergency, specifically for saliva collection devices, we do want to ensure that they have been appropriately validated. And we can do that in a couple of ways. We have authorized tests that include specific collection devices. And so in those cases the collection device is considered part of the test system and is authorized as such. That does not mean that those collection devices have an authorization. They are only authorized within that EUA as a system. Collection devices can also submit their own EUA to get their own authorization, similar to how we've authorized a couple of standalone home collection kits. We can do that both for home collection and not. Such that the collection device itself would have an authorization. And then other tests can leverage that authorization and incorporate it into their EUA. So a test could request in their EUA, to be authorized for use with that previously authorized collection device.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Do EUA tests need to be revalidated with PBS as a specimen transport medium prior to use?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: EUA test revalidation with PBS depends on its use. Labs adding PBS for healthcare worker use in traditional settings do not need FDA authorization. Kit manufacturers adding PBS must validate, notify FDA, and submit data within 15 days. For non-traditional collection (e.g., home), prior validations (like Gates Foundation's) can be referenced.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Do EUA tests need to be revalidated with PBS as a specimen transport medium prior to use?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So well from a regulatory perspective how the FDA views this depends. So if it's a lab and they simply want to add PBS or normal saline to what they give their users - their healthcare worker users to use, but it doesn't involve like non-traditional settings like the home, no FDA authorization is required. If it's a kit manufacturer and they want to claim a normal saline or PBS in their kit they can validate, notify us and send validation data just within 15 business days, to include that into their kit. And then of course in the non-traditional collection or testing situation - let's talk about collections. The Gates Foundation in partnership with others -- and I'm blanking on all the names -- did validate normal saline. And I forget if they also did PBS. But we pretty much view those as very similar in the non-traditional collection, i.e. home, and did some stability studies in saline. And any developers that want to utilize that data of the Gates Foundation and their partners, is allowed a right of reference to use that for other applications, as may apply.

VERBATIM QUESTION: What additional mitigations might FDA consider pre-market or post-market for controlling bias in clinical studies?
VERBATIM ANSWER: There may be additional mitigation that we'll look into, you know, and that could be weaved pre-market or it can be considered post-market.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What steps should smaller laboratories follow to validate off-label use of FDA-approved multi-analyte respiratory panel tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA may consider expanding FAQs or providing additional recommendations to guide smaller labs in validating off-label uses of multi-analyte respiratory panel tests.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What steps should smaller laboratories follow to validate off-label use of FDA-approved multi-analyte respiratory panel tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, so, I think that's a good thing to take back, Toby. I mean, certainly, I think we've provided flexibility to allow, you know, FAQ's, perhaps we can expand that a little bit. You know, making recommendations about how a lab might validate that for their own purposes is a scientific question that, you know, I don't know that the FDA is, you know, prohibited from joining in on. So, I think if labs are wanting some additional, say, recommendations on validations, it's something we need to take back and consider.
