#### 4. Balancing Sensitivity, Cost, and Frequency in Antigen Testing

QA Block 4-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Do you have any comment on the 90% specificity requirement for antigen tests, given that the contagious period correlates with higher viral loads rather than PCR sensitivity above a CT of 30?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends 80% sensitivity for home use antigen tests when prescribed by a clinician, and 90% for non-prescribed use. They recognize the utility of antigen tests for identifying individuals with higher viral loads, particularly within the infectious period. The FDA is flexible and supports the development of affordable tests, including serial testing strategies, and encourages dialogue with developers.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Do you have any comment on the 90% specificity requirement for antigen tests, given that the contagious period correlates with higher viral loads rather than PCR sensitivity above a CT of 30?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So yes I tried to address that a little bit at the beginning of the call was what our recommendations are. I didn't go into specificity there. The recommended sensitivity for non-lab home when there is a prescription is the templates is 80%. And if it is not to involve a clinician prescribing the test then we recommend 90%. We obviously have authorized three direct antigen tests already that, you know, met the 80% bar. And two of them were able to achieve greater than 90% sensitivity. That said, we absolutely see value in clearly being able to help identify folks who maybe are symptomatic, asymptomatic and but have viral levels of virus higher than more virus then say a cut off with a CT of 30. You know, if such validation probably will also include symptomatic individuals since it's hard to figure out when somebody is asymptomatic gets infected and begins to shed virus. So we like to see that the performance of such tests on symptomatic people and perhaps a certain number of days after symptoms begin. So in the case of the authorization so far, it was dependent on data and how long the data was collected in those particular studies. And we could authorize for those days or in some cases it may have been derived because sensitivity may fall off after a certain period of time for the direct antigen test as far as detecting something that molecular could detect beyond that period. But one of them we authorized up to twelve days after symptoms which is quite long for an antigen test and is quite good. And so yes we wholeheartedly agree that and support, which is why we put the template out, the development of more and more tests that could be used in settings such as the home. And we very supportive of non instrumented direct antigen tests and there's a number in the pipeline. So we anticipate, you know, that some of those are going to be highly successful. If they're, you know, so those are recommended sensitivities. If developers such as yourself or anybody else has ideas around how we can mitigate some of the potential safety issues, we're all ears. We're open to things like serial testing so testing not just once in the home situation that maybe twice and what interval spacing might be for those tests, you know, is to be determined by the particular test and any data that's accumulated in that setting. So we're flexible. We're adaptable. We see the value in having a lot more tests out there that obviously the direct antigen tests are not as sensitive as the high sensitivity molecular assays and we understand that. And we agree that the focus is important to make sure that we identify those who are potentially infective rather than just, you know, a long tail of, you know, RNA being shredded perhaps, and not infectious. So hopefully that helps you encourages you to come in and have a dialogue about us about your ideas about how to bring something forward.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA evaluate or authorize tests differently based on the duration of time after symptom onset?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We like to see that the performance of such tests on symptomatic people and perhaps a certain number of days after symptoms begin.

QA Block 4-5
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are there specific guidelines on validating tests for detecting individuals with higher viral loads (e.g., CT values under 30)?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends 80% sensitivity for non-lab home tests prescribed by a clinician, and 90% sensitivity for those without clinician involvement. The FDA values tests targeting viral loads corresponding to CT levels below 30 and encourages validation including symptomatic individuals, particularly within a defined timeframe after symptom onset. A flexible approach is supported for developing efficient, home-based antigen tests, with an emphasis on identifying individuals who are infectious rather than focusing solely on high sensitivity.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are there specific guidelines on validating tests for detecting individuals with higher viral loads (e.g., CT values under 30)?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So yes I tried to address that a little bit at the beginning of the call was what our recommendations are. I didn't go into specificity there.

So we like to see that the performance of such tests on symptomatic people and perhaps a certain number of days after symptoms begin. So in the case of the authorization so far, it was dependent on data and how long the data was collected in those particular studies. And we could authorize for those days or in some cases it may have been derived because sensitivity may fall off after a certain period of time for the direct antigen test as far as detecting something that molecular could detect beyond that period. But one of them we authorized up to twelve days after symptoms which is quite long for an antigen test and is quite good. And so yes we wholeheartedly agree that and support, which is why we put the template out, the development of more and more tests that could be used in settings such as the home.

#### 6. EUA Submission Process and Notification Pathway Guidance

QA Block 6-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is there a time frame post-EUA submission when a lead reviewer will be assigned?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Assignment of a lead reviewer is not required to begin marketing if the test qualifies for the notification pathway. For EUA applications, FDA processes submissions based on priority and completeness, providing weekly updates as needed.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Hi. I was wondering if there is a time frame post-EUA submission that we can expect a lead viewer to be assigned?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So well I'm not sure that that's correct. So if you - if you're a test developer who qualifies, you know I'm assuming kit here, and you qualify for the notification pathway, whether you're serology, molecular, or direct antigen. Those are the three that we allow notification of. You simply follow the notification rule in the guidance. Say that you've finished your validation and that you would - that you want to begin marketing. You'll get an immediate confirmation that we've received your email. And then within 24 hours, you should receive confirmation of the notification acknowledgment which you can use to show anybody that we've acknowledged your notification and you can begin marketing. It's not you're marketing if you're - if you have a test that's allowed through notification assignment of a lead reviewer is not required in order to begin marketing and apologize for any misinterpretation there on - or not clear communication on our part. We are simply overwhelmed with the number of applications. We allow notification pathways so that people can get to the market without having a EUA decision. It's your kit, you know, there are rules around how soon after you notify us that we want to see a EUA application. We then figure out when those applications come in if - what the priority rank is. And some of that is when we do receive it relative to others and if it's complete or not. If there's anything that's incomplete, I've directed the office and whether it's the contact or a reviewer, that we give you feedback as soon as possible on anything that's incomplete. And then you can work if it's not a reviewer you have contact with it's another contract in the office, you get at least a weekly update. You can submit that following information to them. They will assess whether the application is then complete and you can move up the priority scale because complete applications will obviously have priority over incomplete applications. And then as I've said before on the call there are certain things that absolutely require an EUA from kit manufacturers that we've prioritized because they can't market until they get that EUA authorization. So they know that this is, you know, well this is best we can do with the resources we have and the absolute number of applications that we have that we're trying to work through as quickly as possible.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Is the Yale SalivaDirect EUA for an actual kit, a product, or a method?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes absolutely. Sure so the Yale Saliva-Direct test was authorized as a test, as a complete test kit because it was authorized not a method. So the test that was authorized consists of the instructions for use that are authorized and all of the components that are specified in the authorized instructions for use. Any laboratory that is interested in performing the test should reach out to Yale to request designation under their EUA. And those labs that are designated by Yale will receive the authorized instructions for use from Yale directly. And they would be responsible for acquiring all of the components that are specified in the authorized instructions for use and performing the test according to the authorized instructions for use in order to be performing the test as an EUA authorized test.

VERBATIM QUESTION: How does one become authorized like Yale to allow other labs to perform the tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Okay. Yes, I think there is a misconception there that they're, you know, somehow deputized or anything like that. This is a test that is authorized for distribution to high complexity certified laboratories. So just like any other authorized test that is distributed by a EUA holder, Yale is responsible for determining who they distribute that test to as long as the labs that are - that they're distributing it to are high complexity CLIA certified laboratories since that is what the test is authorized for. So that's no different than any other EUA holder distributing their authorized test to the labs that purchase it from them. The - this difference is that Yale is not requiring payment for the distribution of their test. Oh and Yale doesn't distribute kit components to labs. They acquire them on their own.

You can simply follow that with - along with all the other recommendations for the tests you want to develop and submit it as one EUA. I think what I meant it'll take longer for you to complete the point of care study, you know, then a standard EUA for say high complexity laboratory situation. You can go ahead and submit what you have to get the initial authorization going. And if you want to market that, the notification pathway is there as well. And that gets all those balls rolling and then you can complete your point of care studies and submit that along. You know, and if the primary application is still in process that can be added prior to authorization or there may be timing where you want the first authorization.

#### 14. Considerations for EUA Authorization Using Saliva Samples

QA Block 14-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the FDA still consider saliva an alternative sample matrix or would it consider a EUA application where saliva is the primary sample matrix?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA considers saliva as a primary sample type for EUA applications, especially given swab and transport media shortages. However, since saliva is challenging, they recommend comparator validation with NP or mid-turbinate swabs, while nasal swabs are less reliable.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA still consider saliva an alternative sample matrix or would it consider a EUA application where saliva is the primary sample matrix?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes we absolutely will consider EUAs for saliva, as the primary sample type. You know, with our intermittent test swab shortages and transport media shortages we see the attractiveness of saliva. We've just known that it's - it can be a problematic sample type. Not infrequently we see performance that's subpar and in some cases haven't been able to authorize. So we do recommend because it is a challenging sample type that the comparator validation be done with preferably an NP swab but a mid-turbinate swab will also be allowed. That's not in the template but just saying that we have that flexibility. We've seen some very variable and difficult to interpret results when a nasal swab is used. So our recommendation is mid-turbinate or NP swab. But absolutely know when we validate but absolutely saliva is an important sample type because of some of the supply issues in the US.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Would the FDA consider a study which doesn't have paired NP swab samples, for example, based on data like Japan's 1,700 paired NP and saliva studies?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA may consider real-world data, such as from Japan's saliva studies, if the same test is being submitted. However, test-to-test differences and variability make paired swab samples, preferably mid-turbinate or NP, strongly recommended for EUA authorization.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Would the FDA consider a study which doesn't have paired NP swab samples, for example, based on data like Japan's 1,700 paired NP and saliva studies?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Here if you're submitting the exact test that was used in Japan and where there's data we can include real-world data and may be sufficient depending on how it was put together. But we've definitely seen what we think to be test to test differences and we still don't understand the variability. And so in order to EUA authorize saliva that is our recommendation that the paired swabs be attained. We're allowing the mid-turbinate because NP swabs are more challenging to obtain. Sometimes patients are less likely to want to volunteer for it but the mid-turbinate is not so bad. It also is lower risk to the healthcare providers who's getting a mid-turbinate swab...

VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA system compare an RT-PCR comparator on the saliva sample?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Here if you're submitting the exact test that was used in Japan and where there's data we can include real-world data and may be sufficient depending on how it was put together. But we've definitely seen what we think to be test to test differences and we still don't understand the variability. And so in order to EUA authorize saliva that is our recommendation that the paired swabs be attained. We're allowing the mid-turbinate because NP swabs are more challenging to obtain. Sometimes patients are less likely to want to volunteer for it but the mid-turbinate is not so bad. It also is lower risk to the healthcare providers who's getting a mid-turbinate swab.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the FDA's stance on using mid-turbinate swabs as an alternative to NP swabs for comparator validation with saliva?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends using an NP swab for comparator validation with saliva, but mid-turbinate swabs are also acceptable due to flexibility in certain cases. Nasal swabs have shown variable and difficult-to-interpret results.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the FDA's stance on using mid-turbinate swabs as an alternative to NP swabs for comparator validation with saliva?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We do recommend because it is a challenging sample type that the comparator validation be done with preferably an NP swab but a mid-turbinate swab will also be allowed. That's not in the template but just saying that we have that flexibility. We've seen some very variable and difficult to interpret results when a nasal swab is used.

VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the current standard for validating performance in point-of-care environments for serology tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We - that's why we put up serology point of care template information about how to go ahead and validate for that. But we do need to see those point of care validation studies to know that the tests will perform at the point of care in the hands of non-lab, non-laboratory health care professionals. So I'll just refer you and any other developers to that template. And of course, if someone has completed all those studies and the studies look good, you know, I do want to hear about that. It is important that we understand the performance of the test. And currently, the NCI testing program is a very important part of our assessment of - can really aid in our assessment of the performance of the serology tests that are amenable for testing in the NCI program.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Would recommending an existing commercially available collection kit for use to send capillary plasma to a high complexity lab require a separate EUA?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA suggests reaching out to the lead developer to discuss details. A separate EUA is not necessarily required, and the kit can be added to an existing EUA submission if applicable.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Would recommending an existing commercially available collection kit for use to send capillary plasma to a high complexity lab require a separate EUA?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes and some of the details are important here and so I would urge you to reach out which you already have a lead developer and discuss that with them. And if they have any questions have them bring it up with me. Of if you haven't submitted anything yet on this, right. And it sounds like you already have a EUA or have one EUA submission so we could add this to that.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does submitting a serology test EUA followed by point-of-care testing require two separate EUAs or just an amendment to the initial EUA application?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Submitting a serology test EUA followed by point-of-care testing can be done as one EUA, or as two packages with the follow-up submitted as an amendment to the first EUA.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does submitting a serology test EUA followed by point-of-care testing require two separate EUAs or just an amendment to the initial EUA application?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes for serology point of care, we do have templates information and recommendations about that. You can simply follow that with - along with all the other recommendations for the tests you want to develop and submit it as one EUA. I think what I meant it'll take longer for you to complete the point of care study, you know, then a standard EUA for say high complexity laboratory situation. You can go ahead and submit what you have to get the initial authorization going. And if you want to market that, the notification pathway is there as well. And that gets all those balls rolling and then you can complete your point of care studies and submit that along. You know, and if the primary application is still in process that can be added prior to authorization or there may be timing where you want the first authorization. So we'll just work with you whether it's all in one package or staged in two different packages. It would be great to be - if it's two packages it should be an amendment to the first one.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Would monitoring for COVID-19 spread in a school district to make decisions about controlling the spread qualify as surveillance testing?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Monitoring COVID-19 spread in a school district to inform decisions about controlling the spread would likely qualify as surveillance testing. FDA does not regulate surveillance testing, so you should consult CMS for CLIA requirements.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Would monitoring for COVID-19 spread in a school district to make decisions about controlling the spread qualify as surveillance testing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So if the school district is looking for information about infection at the community level then that would likely fall under surveillance. And if you're looking for and as you state, FDA does not generally regulate surveillance testing. So then if what you're doing - if you believe what you're doing does fall under surveillance then I would encourage you to reach out to CMS to determine the CLIA requirements there.

QA Block 14-5
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Why does the FDA recommend a mid-turbinate or NP swab over nasal swabs for comparator validation for saliva?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends mid-turbinate or NP swabs for comparator validation of saliva due to the variability and difficulty in interpreting results when nasal swabs are used.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Why does the FDA recommend a mid-turbinate or NP swab over nasal swabs for comparator validation for saliva?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We do recommend because it is a challenging sample type that the comparator validation be done with preferably an NP swab but a mid-turbinate swab will also be allowed. That's not in the template but just saying that we have that flexibility. We've seen some very variable and difficult to interpret results when a nasal swab is used. So our recommendation is mid-turbinate or NP swab.
