#### 1. Updates on SARS-CoV-2 Testing Development Challenges

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the FDA's specific parameters for conducting foreign studies to acquire positive samples for point-of-care or at-home COVID-19 tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA allows foreign studies to acquire positive samples when numbers are falling but recommends first attempting U.S.-based studies due to conditions like user interaction and usability in typical situations. Factors such as the unique testing environments in U.S. schools and workplaces, as well as busy clinical settings, must be considered to ensure valid results.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the FDA's specific parameters for conducting foreign studies to acquire positive samples for point-of-care or at-home COVID-19 tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: In the recent weeks we have expressed willingness, as numbers were falling to have foreign studies done in order to get positive samples, especially in the point of care and home situations and of course we always said we would like to see, we recommend you attempt to try those studies in the U.S.U.S. first and only if you are unable to get the positives that are needed to go to the ex-U.S. site. We have given a lot of parameters around that. One of the reasons for starting in the U.S. has been we wanted to see even negative sample usability and user interaction in typical point-of-care and typical home situations in the U.S., in English, so we have a good understanding of that. Of course, with point-of-care tests, the U.S. is different than some other countries in how point of care testing is done during this pandemic in a lot of different ways now that point of care testing can be done at schools and at workplaces which have never done it before. There is more than 30,000 new waived labs in the U.S. Traditionally, and we like to see that here in the U.S., that the point-of-care study is done in busy clinical office practices where they are frequently distracted by the many things that they do in that office. And even in the midst of those distractions can get an accurate result. That is the real situation in the U.S. typically for point- of-care tests and we want to make sure the instructions in these will work such that even in the busy setting where they are not just potentially standing there watching the test develop, but if it is 15 minute incubation, they are off doing other things and they correctly get back to the testing workstation, for example, and read the test.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is saliva pooling suitable for point-of-care or home testing settings given the additional complexities mentioned?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Saliva pooling may pose challenges in point-of-care and home settings, but the FDA is open to its use. Guidance on maintaining sensitivity and pooling methods is available, though certain pooling pathways are currently limited to nasal swabs.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is saliva pooling suitable for point-of-care or home testing settings given the additional complexities mentioned?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Recommendations for saliva pooling? I do not think we have specific recommendations for that, but we are open to it. It may be more difficult a say in point-of-care setting or in a home setting, but absolutely open to it and would pretty much follow what we are recommending for swabs. You can pool the saliva first and then run your assay and determine with the various methods that we recommend how many samples you can pool and not reduce the potential sensitivity too much. We would like to see that the sensitivity doesn't drop below an overall 85% relative to the saliva run straight on the same device. There is a pooling amendment or pathway to add pooling more easily. That option is not available for saliva. That is only available for nasal swabs. That does not mean we are not open to the submission for pooling of saliva. Hopefully that addresses your question.

#### 12. Robustness Testing Requirements for Point-of-Care Antibody Tests

QA Block 12-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What should be done if a semi-quantitative point-of-care antibody test shows half the amount of antibodies with half the specimen volume and double the antibodies with double the specimen volume under robustness study requirements?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends that devices for point-of-care tests recognize incorrect specimen volumes and provide feedback or no results. Current design may fit moderate/high complexity situations. Dialog with FDA review staff is advised for adjustments and mitigation.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What should be done if a semi-quantitative point-of-care antibody test shows half the amount of antibodies with half the specimen volume and double the antibodies with double the specimen volume under robustness study requirements?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah. That is exactly why we asked for the flex study. These flex studies, or robustness studies, are designed to test non-laboratory healthcare workers and their ability to perform tests. They are not trained in precision pipetting. The ideal device, as you describe,would recognize the volume is not sufficient or it is too much. It would not provide a result or would provide some feedback. So as your device is designed right now, it might be more appropriate for a moderate or high complexity situation. I would have this specific dialog with our review staff and what mitigations you might have for this. But typically, providing precision pipetting or precision capillary blood assessment in the point of care setting is more than the traditional say settings of being skilled at. There is enough concern about untrained laboratorians performing tests and we try to make it as easy as possible for them. Many of them just follow pictures. That is the intent of the flex studies. That could be a review issue for us. If you still want to pursue that I recommend having this specific dialogue with our review staff as soon as possible.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the NPA requirement stated in templates for molecular and antigen diagnostic devices for non-laboratory use also apply to the regular antigen template?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The NPA requirement in the molecular and antigen diagnostic templates for non-laboratory use does not strictly apply to regular antigen templates. Some flexibility is allowed, as rapid antigen tests may have slightly lower NPA than central lab molecular tests. However, achieving high specificity remains a key aim, especially in OTC devices to reduce false positives.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the NPA requirement stated in templates for molecular and antigen diagnostic devices for non-laboratory use also apply to the regular antigen template?
VERBATIM ANSWER: For point-of-care antigen that I think is for OTC. With OTC you don't have a health professional involved at all and interpreting results and there can be a false positive with any device. It was a recommendation that OTC devices have a very high specificity of NPA. You can look at what we have authorized to see what has been able to be achieved we do not typically recommend an NPA at this time because in some situations there's a little bit more flexibility between devices, we do not want to set up a recommended level for all devices. We know rapid antigen tests have a slightly lower NPA than a good central lab molecular test but that they both have false positives. We are not expecting perfection in the clinical studies. There are few devices that are perfect. We are aiming for as specific a device as possible. Definitely in serology and more frequently than other devices have seen issues with specificity or NPA being too low and an antigen test, for example, or a point-of-care that's too low you are going to end up generating a lot of false positives, and there is risk of a false positive and there is harm. We have had MDR reports of that harm or potential harm. Sometimes healthcare workers put those positive patients without confirmation into the COVID ward.

QA Block 5-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the FDA require at-home users to report both positive and negative test results via software applications to the CDC or healthcare providers?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA does not require a reporting feature for at-home test results at the time of authorization. Post-authorization, the FDA may request a commitment to develop this feature. It is acceptable to include an opt-out option for users who do not wish to report their results, but reporting is encouraged.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA require at-home users to report both positive and negative test results via software applications to the CDC or healthcare providers?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We do not have a requirement for a reporting feature at the time of authorization of an at-home test. We do think that reporting is important and we have asked in some cases for a post-authorization commitment to develop the reporting feature. It is acceptable to have an opt out feature for those who do not wish to report their results. The opt out feature is for home-based users who for whatever reason may not want their results reported. That is acceptable. Of course, we want to encourage everyone who uses the device to report results so that we can better track this pandemic.
