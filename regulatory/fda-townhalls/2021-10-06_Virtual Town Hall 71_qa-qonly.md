QA Block 2-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the expectation for monitoring in a COVID-flu combo test regarding the impact of SARS-CoV-2 viral mutations on flu performance?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Developers should monitor both the impact of SARS-CoV-2 mutations on flu performance and flu mutations on flu analyte performance using a risk-based approach with evaluations supported by literature and in silico analyses. The main emphasis remains SARS-CoV-2.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the expectation for monitoring in a COVID-flu combo test regarding the impact of SARS-CoV-2 viral mutations on flu performance?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So indeed, the expectation is to monitor both of these issues-- the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 virus mutations on flu performance and the impact of flu viral limitations on the flu analyte performance as well. However, your monitoring procedures should follow a risk-based approach, which includes an evaluation of the current published literature, periodic in silico analysis, and other sources of information that you may have available to you to kind of guide the frequency depth of the analysis that you're performing you after you receive your EUA. The focus of this amendment was certainly SARS-CoV-2. However, we are including all of the target analytes as well to kind of be make sure this is a comprehensive approach. But again, I think the focus is SARS-CoV-2, because that is certainly the need right now.

We do not require that asymptomatic individuals be tested serially, but that is an option for mitigation to get an authorization for screening if you don't have asymptomatic data. So you can discuss this further with your reviewer, but if you have data that meets the bar that we've recommended in that supplemental template, then proceeding with serial testing is an option as you continue to collect asymptomatic data.

#### 8. FDA Guidance on At-Home Inflammation Test Development

QA Block 8-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the FDA see a significant need for inflammation tests that can be used at home or at the point of care to triage individuals for treatments such as monoclonal antibody therapy?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA has authorized a few IL-6 tests through the EUA process. They recommend submitting a pre-EUA for such tests as there are no templates available, and a targeted discussion on the intended use would be beneficial.
VERBATIM QUESTION: There's some information on the FDA website about potentially providing EUAs for COVID severity testing. And I'm from a company called Sci Fox and we have an inflammation test that can be used at home or a point of care that we're developing. And we're curious about whether the FDA sees that as a big need, for example, for triaging people to get monoclonal antibody treatment or whatever it might be-- the route if they're likely to have a severe outcome. So how is that viewed, and is there any guidance on what you'd be looking for in an at home version of that test or some kind of point of need version for pharmacies, where people, if they get tested positive, can get a test and see if they need to see a doctor or get further investigation?

#### 9. Labeling Updates for Test Performance and Variant Detection

QA Block 9-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: When developers identify viral mutations and analyze if their tests are impacted, is it expected for labeling to state effectiveness against specific variants like the Delta variant?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA requires developers to monitor for risks of tests being impacted by known mutations and address issues via test or label updates. Labeling has not been required to proactively state detection of specific variants but should specify that the test hasn't been validated for all circulating variants.
VERBATIM QUESTION: When developers identify viral mutations and analyze if their tests are impacted, is it expected for labeling to state effectiveness against specific variants like the Delta variant?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So far, what we've done is the monitoring that we've had developers do is to see if there's a risk that their test would be negatively impacted by any known mutations. So if that comes up and we find that the test is impacted by a particular mutation or mutations, we would work with the developer to address that issue, whether it's through modifying the test or modifying the labeling. We have not asked for updated labeling to say proactively that a test does detect specific variants. We have instead asked for the labeling to be updated as outlined in the conditions of authorization to specify that it has not been validated in all circulating variants.

#### 11. Recommendations for Molecular Testing Target Requirements and Validation

QA Block 11-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Do you have any guidance or expectations around a two-target approach for molecular testing?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends a two-target approach to mitigate viral mutation impact, but it is not an absolute requirement. Single-target tests can be authorized if they are well-conserved, validated, and have a plan for variant monitoring. This applies to both EUA and 510k submissions.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Do you have any guidance or expectations around a two-target approach for molecular testing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We do have recommendations in the EUA template for what we're looking for validation, and we do recommend multiple targets as one of the mitigations against an impact of viral mutations. We provide recommendations. We don't have absolute requirements. But we do recommend multiple targets. If you've got a single target, you think it's well-conserved, you validated it, and you have a plan to monitor for variants, it's certainly something that we have authorized in the past. There are single tests out there that are available. It's good to have a backup target. You're asking about 510k as well, and I think it applies the same way to 510k. There is certainly no requirement about how many targets you have per analyte. And that's been true for many tests, not just for respiratory tests as well.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Is there any difference in the two-target approach between EUA and 510k?
VERBATIM ANSWER: No, not really. This honestly is a recommendation. We believe that the multitask test is more robust, but if you've got a single target, you think it's well-conserved, you validated it, and you have a plan to monitor for variants, it's certainly something that we have authorized in the past.

We believe that the multitask test is more robust, but if you've got a single target, you think it's well-conserved, you validated it, and you have a plan to monitor for variants, it's certainly something that we have authorized in the past. There are single tests out there that are available. So as to we mentioned, it's not a requirement. This is kind of a scientific issue. It's good to have a backup target. You're asking about 510k as well, and I think it applies the same way to 510k. There is certainly no requirement about how many targets you have per analyte. And that's been true for many tests, not just for respiratory tests as well.

#### 19. Simulated Versus Real Environments in Validation Studies

QA Block 19-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Would it be inappropriate to run a point-of-care clinical study in a simulation lab that simulates a point-of-care context?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends discussing this in a pre-EUA context. Point-of-care tests should ideally be studied in true point-of-care environments, and the acceptability depends on whether the simulation involves just the setup or the workflow.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Would it be inappropriate to run a point-of-care clinical study in a simulation lab that simulates a point-of-care context?
VERBATIM ANSWER: That may be something that we need to discuss in a pre-EUA way with some additional detail. We do want to see point-of-care tests studied in a true point-of-care environment. So that it would depend a little bit on whether if you're simulating just the setup, that's different than simulating the workflow of the settings. So that's something that we would suggest you come in to talk to us about.

REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 19-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Why would an OTC simulated use human factors and clinical evaluation study be sufficient for getting a point-of-care designation automatically if there are concerns about the environment for point-of-care?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recognizes this concern but affirms that under the current regulatory framework, an OTC designation typically qualifies for an automatic CLIA-waived designation, which also applies within the EUA framework.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Why would an OTC simulated use human factors and clinical evaluation study be sufficient for getting a point-of-care designation automatically if there are concerns about the environment for point-of-care?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Sure, and that's a fair point. But really, we're kind of bound by the regulatory system we're working in right now. So I think currently, if you get that OTC designation, you're kind of automatically eligible for CLIA-waived type of designation. That kind of framework is being used in the EUA as well. So it's a fair point, but that's just kind of the regulatory landscape that we're operating in right now.

QA Block 19-5
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What distinguishes simulating the setup from simulating the workflow of a point-of-care environment?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Simulating just the setup differs from simulating the workflow of point-of-care settings, and the FDA prefers tests to be studied in a true point-of-care environment.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What distinguishes simulating the setup from simulating the workflow of a point-of-care environment?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We do want to see point-of-care tests studied in a true point-of-care environment.

QA Block 19-6
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What requirements should developers meet when conducting studies in simulated environments to ensure they align with true point-of-care conditions?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends conducting validation studies in the actual setting where the test will be used, particularly for point-of-care (POC) environments. Simulation is unnecessary since POC users and health providers are present. For home use, logistical challenges such as sample collection and shipping tracking arise.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What requirements should developers meet when conducting studies in simulated environments to ensure they align with true point-of-care conditions?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Validation studies should be done in the setting that they're going to be used in. And so in a POC environment, you've got the actual POC users. There's nothing needed to simulate there. You've got health providers that can take the comparative method sample. So logistically, there's not a lot of showstoppers. Now if you thought about home validation of a home use test, then you start having some logistical challenges-- who's going to take comparative method is one. And how do you keep track of what user is testing the sample when, and their shipping conditions.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Kris Roth (FDA)
TOPICS: validation requirements, point-of-care testing, simulated environments
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 19-7
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What logistical issues should be considered if a home use test requires shipping samples for comparative method testing?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Logistical challenges for home use test validation include determining who will take the comparative method sample, tracking which user tests which sample, and managing shipping conditions. These were major reasons for shifting to simulated home use for EUA validation.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What logistical issues should be considered if a home use test requires shipping samples for comparative method testing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Now if you thought about home validation of a home use test, then you start having some logistical challenges-- who's going to take comparative method is one. And how do you keep track of what user is testing the sample when, and their shipping conditions. So I think that's why we shifted to the simulated home use for the EUA-- was to streamline that validation process, because there were these kind of showstopper issues for validation of the home use tests. And frankly, I think even in the 510k world, we're still discussing appropriate study designs for validation for home and how to kind of overcome some of those challenges.

QA Block 19-8
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How should developers track and document which user tests a sample in home use validation studies?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Tracking which user tests a sample and their shipping conditions poses logistical challenges in home use validation studies, leading FDA to favor simulated home use validation under EUA guidelines.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How should developers track and document which user tests a sample in home use validation studies?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Now if you thought about home validation of a home use test, then you start having some logistical challenges-- who's going to take comparative method is one.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Why does the current regulatory framework link OTC designation to automatic CLIA-waived designation?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The current regulatory framework ties OTC designation to automatic CLIA-waived designation due to the existing regulatory system and EUA framework.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Why does the current regulatory framework link OTC designation to automatic CLIA-waived designation?

#### 20. Clarifying Specimen Types for Comparator Test Authorization

QA Block 20-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: When developing our test, if the comparator we selected uses the mid-turbinate specimen type but we want to use the anterior specimen type, can we do this in a clinical study?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends using the comparator method as authorized, typically nasopharyngeal swabs, especially for 510(k) submissions. Using a different specimen type, like nasal swabs, is not appropriate if the test is not authorized for that use.
VERBATIM QUESTION: When developing our test, if the comparator we selected uses the mid-turbinate specimen type but we want to use the anterior specimen type, can we do this in a clinical study?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah, so we do typically recommend nasopharyngeal as the comparator method. And especially for 510ks, that's likely what we will be expecting. And so as we've mentioned earlier, we do expect the comparator method to be performed as authorized. So it would not be appropriate to use a nasal swab for the comparator method, especially if the test is not authorized for that.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Ivory Chang
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: Comparator specimen types, Clinical study requirements
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 20-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Do we have to use exactly the specimen type authorized for the comparator test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends that the comparator method be performed as authorized, meaning the same specimen type should be used (e.g., nasopharyngeal) and other types like nasal swabs are not appropriate if not authorized.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Do we have to use exactly the specimen type authorized for the comparator test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So we're recommending that the comparator test be used as authorized. That does not mean that you need to run your candidate test in that way. I may have misunderstood your question. Yeah, so we do typically recommend nasopharyngeal as the comparator method. And especially for 510ks, that's likely what we will be expecting. And so as we've mentioned earlier, we do expect the comparator method to be performed as authorized. So it would not be appropriate to use a nasal swab for the comparator method, especially if the test is not authorized for that.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the expectation for monitoring in a COVID-flu combo test regarding the impact of flu viral mutations on flu performance?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA expects monitoring of both the impact of SARS-CoV-2 mutations on flu performance and flu viral mutations on flu performance, using a risk-based approach including in silico analysis and literature review. The primary focus remains on SARS-CoV-2.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the expectation for monitoring in a COVID-flu combo test regarding the impact of flu viral mutations on flu performance?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So indeed, the expectation is to monitor both of these issues-- the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 virus mutations on flu performance and the impact of flu viral limitations on the flu analyte performance as well. However, your monitoring procedures should follow a risk-based approach, which includes an evaluation of the current published literature, periodic in silico analysis, and other sources of information that you may have available to you to kind of guide the frequency depth of the analysis that you're performing you after you receive your EUA. The focus of this amendment was certainly SARS-CoV-2. However, we are including all of the target analytes as well to kind of be make sure this is a comprehensive approach.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Is there a maximum time lag between recruitment and testing that is acceptable for enrollment in a study for antigen and molecular home use products?
VERBATIM ANSWER: At the time of the moment, that individual needs to meet the enrollment criteria. And whatever that is, you're going to have your typical criteria, and that needs to be met at the time of enrollment in the study. [...] If there's a month-long lag between you first identify the folks and when they're enrolled in the study, then you need to reconfirm those kind of time-dependent enrollment criteria.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can a pediatric swab with a mini tip be used for anterior nasal specimen collection for a home OTC COVID molecular test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends submitting a pre-EUA for this specific question and expects validation of the alternate swab type through clinical and usability studies.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can a pediatric swab with a mini tip be used for anterior nasal specimen collection for a home OTC COVID molecular test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Thanks for that. So we would ask that you submit a pre-EUA, since this is a very specific question related to your test. But generally, if you're using sort of an alternate swab type, we would expect you to validate it and use it in your clinical study and your usability, and demonstrate appropriate validation. But I think that is something that is probably worth sending in a pre-EUA, since that's very specific.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA generally expects over-the-counter IVD products to be shelf stable and not require refrigeration, though specific cases requiring refrigeration might warrant further discussion.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is there an expectation that an OTC IVD product must be shelf stable and shouldn't require refrigeration?
VERBATIM ANSWER: That's probably something that we will need to consider, but I think that's not something that we would typically think is appropriate for over the counter. So if there's some additional reason why that might be needed, we would want to have some further discussions with you on that. But generally, we would expect over-the-counter to be shelf stable.
