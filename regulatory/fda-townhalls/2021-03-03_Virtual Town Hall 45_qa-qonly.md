#### 2. Adding Alternative Swabs to Ensure Supply Chain Continuity

QA Block 2-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can we add an additional swab with the same fit, form, and function as originally used swabs to the test kit after clinical evaluation testing is complete?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Yes, FDA supports adding swabs with the same fit, form, and function if they ensure supply chain adequacy and are for the same body site. Such a change is unlikely to cause review issues but should be discussed with the review team. Minimal additional validation, such as analytical, may be required.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can we add an additional swab with the same fit, form, and function as originally used swabs to the test kit after clinical evaluation testing is complete?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, no I think I understand and we absolutely want to ensure adequacy of supply chain my - our prepared remarks was going to speak to some supply chain, potential supply chain issues in our focus on making sure that that's not an issue. So if it's also a mid-turbinate swab and it is just a different provider but different swab manufacturer, you know, it's unlikely to cause a review issue. But that's the sort of question to ask the review team. We're going to be very supportive of adding additional alternatives especially if it's just the same body site. So if it's mid-turbinate to mid-turbinate with antigen tests that is - that's going to be easier than if you moved to a different site or location. And that might need additional validation but hopefully minimal and perhaps only analytical validation at most of additional swab that is the same as the study swab.

REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 2-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What aspects of fit, form, and function would be concerning to the FDA in this context?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is unlikely to be concerned about a new swab from a different manufacturer if it is for the same body site (e.g., mid-turbinate) as the study swab. A change in body site might require additional validation, but minimal validation would typically be needed for a similar swab.

#### 5. FDA's Prioritization of EUA Requests for Testing Solutions

QA Block 5-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are there any guidelines FDA can provide for EUAs that have been accepted and are pending review regarding how long those authorizations can be expected if they are not a priority EUA?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA continues to receive high volumes of EUA submissions and prioritizes them based on public health need, including unmet needs, accessibility, and manufacturing capacity. Reviews proceed as quickly as possible with higher priority given to complete and critical applications.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are there any guidelines FDA can provide for EUAs that have been accepted and are pending review regarding how long those authorizations can be expected if they are not a priority EUA?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Okay great. So to address your question about, you know, review timeline and prioritization we are, you know, continuing as we talked about before to have large volumes of submissions. And we are having to prioritize those submissions. We, you know, discussed previously that we prioritize based on the public health need and we consider, you know, factors such as whether the product would serve a significant unmet need particularly in terms of access such as at home specimen collection or at-home testing or the ability to expand the availability significantly such as the quantity and manufacturing capacity. So those are some of the considerations that go into our prioritizations. And additionally we, you know, we are trying to review it as quickly as possible but we do use those prioritization factors to determine, you know, the order in which we review and where we spend our resources. And we also consider, you know, how complete a submission is in terms of whether we can move that forward.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Elaine Allan
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)

VERBATIM QUESTION: Which flu test should be used as a comparator for validating multi-analyte SARS-CoV-2 tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We just wanted to clarify that we do have recommendations regarding which flu test should be used as a comparator. And we prefer molecular free tests that have been cleared in the last five years or at least that have clinical data from the last five years to ensure that those comparators are still testing currently circulating strains. And if you have a question about an appropriate comparator you can reach out to the EUA mailbox and we would recommend doing this before performing your study to ensure that you confirm that you're using an appropriate comparator before collecting data.

QA Block 5-6
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How does the FDA determine which tests are considered lower priority for EUA review?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA determines lower priority tests for EUA review by considering the stage of the pandemic, public health needs, product availability, and the ability of a test to expand capacity or accessibility. Lower priority is assigned to submissions that contribute minimally to testing needs or those with incomplete data. Active reviews focus on more critical applications.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How does the FDA determine which tests are considered lower priority for EUA review?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So okay. The priorities - so if somebody has come in, and there's two different kinds of lower priority. So if someone's in and you have not have an active reviewer but we haven't made a determination, we will get to your applications as soon as possible. And this is especially true for those who have notified the FDA and are allowed to sell their tests in the United States prior to an FDA authorization. We are making some other decisions and sending out de-prioritization letters. And I did want to go over that now in more detail. And so we do continue to receive a high volume of EUA requests and want to again share our priorities. As we've stated before, we believe we're at a different stage in the pandemic now than we we're even a half year ago or several months ago in terms of tests available and testing needs. And so accordingly we have prioritized reviews and authorizations of EUA requests that take into account a variety of the factors as discussed in the guidance emergency use authorization and medical products and related authorities. And, you know, important to this is the public health need for the product and the availability of the product, you know, how much product could be brought into the US over time and certain things like - I'll go into some of those other details but, you know, product availability is also important. We have for example prioritized review of EUA requests that have to do with increasing test accessibility, for example point of care tests, home collection kits, home tests and those tests that would significantly increase testing capacity, for example tests that significantly reduce reliance on test supplies that may limit access as well as those tests that are extremely high throughput FDA Townhall and widely distributed and can run on platforms that are widely distributed in order to best address public health needs. But if you're a notified test and you're allowed to be on the market you may be in a lower priority than this but you can stay on the market. But we are on new test submissions, we are occasionally making determinations that we're not likely to get to those EUAs and so there's a different kind of response from the FDA. It's important to ensure and it's critical to ensure adequate supply chains for authorized tests and avoid spot shortages and widespread shortages of testing supplies. So especially for priority tests we would like to avoid those shortages that could happen with diversion of supplies away from non-priority tests. Also, you know, diverting as way of an explanation for these priorities in more detail, diverting reviewer time to reviewing EUAs that would minimally contribute to expanding US testing capacity or patient access to testing would delay the review of EUAs for tests that would better serve the public. That's the reason for some of the shuffling and the priority, prioritization that's going on now with tests that have been submitted. Additionally even for priority tests if the data in that EUA request is not supported to use, the data isn't good enough, we have an obligation at the FDA to decline an EUA authorization to protect the American public.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: How should developers handle expiration date changes for test kits such as the Abbott BinaxNOW examples?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The Abbott BinaxNOW test kits have been authorized for a nine-month shelf life. Abbott has issued letters to customers listing the updated expiration dates for all product lots, which supersede the dates on the packaging. Labs can present these letters during CLIA inspections to validate the use of kits beyond the printed expiration date, and CMS has agreed to recognize these letters.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How should developers handle expiration date changes for test kits such as the Abbott BinaxNOW examples?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The Abbott has now authorized - has now been authorized for a nine month dating on their Abbott BinaxNOW. There was some reports product in the field that may go out of date. Abbott has addressed this through a letter to customers on which you can reach out to Abbott about. Many customers have now received that I'm aware. So all products that they've produced for the Abbott BinaxNOW from the beginning can now have nine month dating. Hold onto that letter if you're a lab. And should CLIA come in to inspect, show them that letter as far as whether or not it was okay to run a test kit that has an expiration date on it. This letter supersedes the expiration date on those kit lots that are provided in the letter provided by. Abbott. and CMS has signaled that they will review those letters, and if the kit lot that you're using is on that list and you're using it up until the new expiration date you should be fine.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What steps should test developers take if their tests are intended for expanding patient access or testing capacity in the US?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Test developers should submit a pre-EUA or email to the FDA's EUA template address (cdrh-eua-templates@fda.hhs.gov) with key information about their test, including patient population, setting, throughput, and manufacturing capacity, to determine prioritization.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What steps should test developers take if their tests are intended for expanding patient access or testing capacity in the US?
VERBATIM ANSWER: If you have a question about determining whether a test that you have in development would be considered high priority review, we recommend that you submit either a pre-EUA or even just an EUA or just an email, either a pre-EUA or an email to our EUA template email box which is cdrh-eua- templates@fda.hhs.gov with information about the features of your test in either a pre-EUA or an email as I've said. It's helpful to have information about your intended patient population, the patient setting whether it's central lab, point of care, home collection or home testing, what it's throughput is, you know, on an instrument for a given shift with a single staff member in the lab and what your manufacturing capacity is.

We are committed to ensuring the public has access to a wide variety of test options and those most - in those reviews that we're doing now we believe do to this prioritization are the most critical ones needed to address the pandemic at this stage. When we do receive a complete submission -- this is important -- with good data for a priority test we move quickly to authorize it as we have done this week with the authorization of another home test, Quidel QuickVue test. It is FDA Townhall by prescription right now but the developer has publicly stated that they intend to come in with an over the counter submission.

#### 6. Clarifying OTC, DTC, and Reporting Requirements for Home Tests

QA Block 6-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is there a difference between OTC (over-the-counter) and DTC (direct-to-consumer)?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: OTC refers to nonprescription tests that can be used entirely at home, while DTC usually refers to home collection tests where samples are sent to a lab for processing.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is there a difference between OTC (over-the-counter) and DTC (direct-to-consumer)?
VERBATIM ANSWER: First regarding DTC and OTC that's - we've tried to use that terminology to make a distinction between home test and a home collection test. So over-the-counter or OTC and direct to consumer or DTC are both nonprescription. They are, you know, by regulation really are - these are, you know, EUAs but OTC is the official term for what we… use for nonprescription. But most people think about OTC as something that you, you know, can purchase, bring home and use completely at home. So we've mostly been using OTC to refer to those at home tests… whereas direct to consumer or DTC we usually use when we're referring to a home collection test where the collection is done at home but you need to send your sample to a lab for processing. So it's not performed fully in the home the way that, you know, a strip like it sounds like yours might be.

QA Block 2-5
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What level of validation is necessary when introducing a new swab targeting the same body site as the original?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Adding a new swab for the same body site, such as mid-turbinate to mid-turbinate, would likely require minimal validation, potentially only analytical validation, if it is equivalent to the study swab.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What level of validation is necessary when introducing a new swab targeting the same body site as the original?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So if it's also a mid-turbinate swab and it is just a different provider but different swab manufacturer, you know, it's unlikely to cause a review issue. But that's the sort of question to ask the review team. We're going to be very supportive of adding additional alternatives especially if it's just the same body site. So if it's mid-turbinate to mid-turbinate with antigen tests that is - that's going to be easier than if you moved to a different site or location. And that might need additional validation but hopefully minimal and perhaps only analytical validation at most of additional swab that is the same as the study swab.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Has anything been done to provide reference material for serology assay developers in the context of serology tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes that's an important question. We still are evaluating tests at NCI as an inter-government agency, interagency government effort obviously NCI and CDC, BARDA, FDA and that program's still active and we are sourcing samples for that. Toby may know more details. I know we are still looking for the ability to send out samples and I haven't gotten an update recently from them that says that they're ready to send those so I expect that they're still working on it. It has been a bit of a challenge to source of these samples and so, you know, in enough quantity to provide to all developers, have noted that WHO has recognized an international standard. I don't - I know it's available for molecular. I don't know if it's available for serology yet so that certainly could play - could be helpful to you. FDA Townhall I will take a note.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does updating an EUA submission for point of care or home use automatically increase its priority in the review process?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Updating an EUA submission for point of care or home use can increase its priority, but it might not be immediate. Developers should flag the update and focus on submitting a fully completed EUA for the intended purpose to avoid confusion.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does updating an EUA submission for point of care or home use automatically increase its priority in the review process?
VERBATIM ANSWER: That is an interesting question. I would suggest that - so I mean yes, it would bump them up in priority. It may not be picked up right away, you know, that it's - it may not be obvious to our process right away that that is the case and so you may need to, you know, particularly flag that you'd like it to be reconsidered for prioritization. You know, generally if a test is designed to be used at the point of care it's not going - it's not likely to have as much usefulness in high complexity setting because it's usually not designed to be, you know, high throughput tests that are high complexity lab might find use for. So it's, you know, we have found in working with developers that it's usually more beneficial to focus on getting all of the point of care testing, you know, fully flushed out and ready and then submitting a, you know, fully completed submission for the actual purpose that you are intending. It does, you know, sort of confuses things to submit it for one use when you don't really intend it to be used there and then update it later.
