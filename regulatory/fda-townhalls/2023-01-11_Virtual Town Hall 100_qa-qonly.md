#### 2. Guidance on SARS-CoV-2 Test Development Controls

QA Block 2-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can SARS-CoV-2 test developers use plasma and serum depleted of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as negative controls for serology and neutralizing antibody tests that have already been granted approval?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends using pre-December 2019 samples as controls. Antibody depletion could alter sample composition, necessitating validation to avoid false results. Significant changes to approved tests require FDA review, and sponsors are advised to consider EUA review priorities or pursue premarket pathways like de novo or 510(k) for non-priority changes.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can SARS-CoV-2 test developers use plasma and serum depleted of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as negative controls for serology and neutralizing antibody tests that have already been granted approval?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So generally we recommend that developers who hold an EUA authorization would first attempt to-- or who are seeking authorization would first attempt to obtain samples collected from prior to December 2019 from vendors and pull them to have enough volume for their testing. We would be concerned that depletion of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from samples may change the sample architecture or the antibody or protein content depending on the depletion method used. So sponsors would need to validate those controls to ensure that false results would not be reported as a result of changes to the composition of the controls. And significant changes to the control's chemistry or composition would need to be submitted to the FDA for review for those tests that have already been granted an EUA-- or issued an EUA. Additionally, we recommend that sponsors review the current policy to consider the FDA's current EUA review priorities, and if the changes that you're looking to make would not meet those review priorities, we would encourage you to pursue a traditional premarket review pathway, such as a de novo or a 510k.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Joseph Tartal (FDA)
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)

#### 3. Comparator Requirements for Multi-Analyte Respiratory Panel Approval

QA Block 3-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Could a molecular influenza COVID multiplex emergency use assay be used as the comparator assay to support a multi-analyte flu and COVID antigen respiratory panel for de novo or 510k?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends using a highly sensitive FDA-cleared RT-PCR test cleared within the past five years for flu as a comparator. Older tests may be considered if their performance remains consistent with current flu strains, demonstrated via in silico analysis. For COVID-19, an EUA-authorized or FDA-cleared highly sensitive RT-PCR test with chemical lysis and solid-phase extraction should be used, validated with clinical samples, showing CT values and at least 95% PPA clinical performance. A pre-submission is advised to discuss studies for de novo or 510k.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Could a molecular influenza COVID multiplex emergency use assay be used as the comparator assay to support a multi-analyte flu and COVID antigen respiratory panel for de novo or 510k?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So to support a multi-analyte antigen respiratory panel, de novo or 510k, we recommend that the comparator method for flu be a highly sensitive FDA-cleared RT-PCR test that was cleared within the past five years. We may consider one that was cleared prior to that time frame, if you can demonstrate that the test performance is expected to remain unchanged with the currently circulating flu strains. That could be done with in silico analysis of the primers and probes. For COVID-19, the comparator method should be an EUA-authorized or FDA-cleared highly sensitive RT- PCR test that uses both a chemical lysis step and solid phase extraction of nucleic acids such as silica bead extraction. And further, the comparator test should be one that is validated with clinical samples and that generates CT values and has established a clinical performance of at least 95% PPA. Generally, if you're looking to pursue a de novo or 510k pathway, we recommend that you submit a pre-submission to discuss your approach for analytical and clinical studies.

#### 4. FDA Guidance on Serial Testing for 510k Submissions

QA Block 4-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can FDA confirm that developers seeking a serial testing indication for their COVID-19 antigen tests in a 510k do not need to include serial testing as part of a prospective clinical evaluation to support the premarket submission?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA has not cleared a 510k for a COVID-19 antigen test and recommends developers submit a pre-submission to discuss validation strategies for 510k or de novo submissions. Data from the NIH-supported UMass study has generally been sufficient for EUAs without requiring additional serial testing studies.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can FDA confirm that developers seeking a serial testing indication for their COVID-19 antigen tests in a 510k do not need to include serial testing as part of a prospective clinical evaluation to support the premarket submission?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So, we've discussed serial testing and antigen tests quite a bit. So to just refresh that, we do continue to work to reflect the need for serial testing in antigen test EUAs. The results of the NIH-supported UMass study have been published, and we are leveraging that data in support of serial testing indications for EUAs. And that means that we've generally not requested additional studies to support serial testing for EUAs. One of the goals of that NIH-supported UMass study was to provide broadly applicable data to avoid the need for individual developers to perform large and expensive studies. And this has generally been quite successful for tests under EUA. For traditional marketing submissions, we have not yet granted a de novo or cleared a 510k-- excuse me-- cleared a 510k for a COVID-19 antigen test. And so we do continue to recommend submitting a pre-submission to discuss your proposed validation strategies if you intend to pursue a 510k or de novo.

#### 5. Mitigating Risks for Low-Accuracy CLIA-Waived Diagnostic Tests

QA Block 5-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Would additional data such as serial testing data collected as part of a prospective clinical evaluation of the candidate tests serve as a suitable mitigation for the risk assessment?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA considers serial testing as one of the appropriate risk mitigations to address lower test accuracy. Additional labeling measures may also provide mitigation.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Would additional data such as serial testing data collected as part of a prospective clinical evaluation of the candidate tests serve as a suitable mitigation for the risk assessment?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Therefore, when considering a test that would be CLIA-waived-- for example, a test seeking an intended use that includes home use or use at a CLIA Certificate of Waiver site, such as a clinic, it's important to consider the accuracy of the test. In situations where a test has a lower accuracy, such as a PPA or MPA lower than 95%, we then consider whether there are appropriate risk mitigations to prevent an unreasonable risk of harm to the patient. As previously discussed, these risk mitigations may include serial testing in the indication to increase the likelihood of an accurate result, as well as labeling, such as warnings, limitations, reporting negative results as presumptive, and potentially other labeling mitigation.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Joseph Tartal (FDA)
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)

QA Block 5-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the difference between FDA clearance or approval and CLIA categorization?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA clearance or approval ensures reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, while CLIA categorization determines whether a test is simple and accurate with negligible risk of error or harm if performed incorrectly.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the difference between FDA clearance or approval and CLIA categorization?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The standards for FDA clearance or approval and the standard for CLIA categorization are different, though FDA is responsible for the administration of both of those. So, FDA clearance or approval is based on a demonstration that there is a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for the device. And categorizing a test as CLIA-waived is based on a determination that the test is so simple and accurate, that there generally is a negligible chance of an erroneous result or no unreasonable risk of harm to the patient if performed incorrectly.

As previously discussed, these risk mitigations may include serial testing in the indication to increase the likelihood of an accurate result, as well as labeling, such as warnings, limitations, reporting negative results as presumptive, and potentially other labeling mitigation. And just to reiterate what I've said a couple of times, we do continue to recommend submitting a pre-submission to discuss your proposed validation strategies if you are intending to pursue a 510k or de novo.

#### 6. Using Predicate Devices for COVID-19 Test Submissions

QA Block 6-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can the BioFire Respiratory Panel 2.1 DEN200031, intended for individuals suspected of COVID-19, be used as a predicate device for a device claiming both symptomatic and asymptomatic use?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Any cleared test or one granted a de novo can be used as a predicate, but this is distinct from being a comparator for clinical studies. FDA recommends a pre-submission or Q-submission for specific guidance on your device and study design.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can the BioFire Respiratory Panel 2.1 DEN200031, intended for individuals suspected of COVID-19, be used as a predicate device for a device claiming both symptomatic and asymptomatic use?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah, so we have gotten a number of questions like this about specific tests asking if they can be used as a predicate device. And any test that is cleared or granted a de novo can be used as a predicate, which is different from what can be used as a comparator for the clinical study. So again, this would fall to the previous comments where we would recommend a pre-submission or Q- submission with specific information about your device and design and your study proposal so that we can make sure that we're giving specific feedback that's appropriate for your situation.

#### 7. FDA Guidance on Randomization in Clinical Study Protocols

QA Block 7-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does FDA still require self-tests to be conducted first before sample collection for RT-PCR in an OTC product clinical study?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA no longer requires self-tests to be conducted first before sample collection for RT-PCR in OTC product clinical studies. Randomization is acceptable, and there is flexibility in swab order as long as a reasonable time period is maintained between swabs.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does FDA still require self-tests to be conducted first before sample collection for RT-PCR in an OTC product clinical study?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So I think the issue of users being taught how to collect an appropriate sample was something that we were concerned about earlier on in the pandemic. I think now we're in a different type of situation where literally a billion tests have been distributed to folks in the US, and certainly finding folks that are naive to self-swabbing is difficult and that's not something we are recommending. So, the concern of finding naive folks or being concerned with folks being trained by watching a health care provider take a nasal swab is much, much less of a concern now than it was quite some time ago. So, I think we are open to a number of different approaches. Randomization certainly is acceptable. I think what's important is to have a-- what we're calling a washout period or a sufficient period between the two samples being taken such that you're getting a good sample for both. In some cases, we have recommended taking the comparative first because that is really the most reflective of how a test will be used in practice. You're not going to take two swabs, you're only going to take one swab, so I think we would be open to that as well. I think the take-home here is that there's really no strong recommendation at this time as far as swab order other than be sure that you have a reasonable time period between the two swabs such that you get a good sample for both tests.

VERBATIM QUESTION: If we assign odd and even numbers for randomization determining the RT-PCR first and second order, would FDA find this approach acceptable?
VERBATIM ANSWER: That would be acceptable, and I think we would also recommend just taking a look at the performance and making sure that the performance for the two tests is-- I'm sorry, whether it's the first or second test, making sure that that's similar. So if you're seeing-- if you do the comparative first, you get one performance, or if you do the competitor second, you get a different performance, that, of course, would raise some red flags.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Should we monitor test performance based on swab order and potentially change strategy based on results?
VERBATIM ANSWER: You could consider that. And if you were going to change the strategy, I think our typical recommendation would be that the patient would have the standard of care done first. Whatever the standard of care test is, and if that's the RT-PCR, then certainly that should be done first, of course.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends attempting to include flu B samples in trials. If the sample number is inadequate, alternate options can be discussed. Testing using banked samples, referencing recent authorizations, or continuing to enroll studies until sufficient samples are collected are alternatives. Current conditions consider low flu B rates this year, and recommendations may evolve in the future.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is recommended for capturing influenza B samples when the rates are so low in the United States?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah, so we have talked about that a bit on here previously, that we would expect you to attempt to include flu B in your trial, and then if you're not able to collect a sufficient number of samples through your trial, you can come talk to us about different potential options for how to move forward there. Kris, do you want to add some more specifics to that one? Yeah, thanks. So, you can take a look at two recent authorizations, one from Lucira, the other from Visby. So those--the data packages that are reflected in those instructions for use don't meet the recommendations for flu A, flu B. There are some other approaches in there. There's some banked sample testing. And you can also look at the conditions of authorization, and you'll note that there's a requirement to keep the study going and enrolling until you do get those recommended flu A and flu B positives. Flu B, of course, is very, very low this year, and certainly we're not requiring companies to collect an impossible number of specimens with the understanding that this year is very low. Perhaps next year it's not low or in the future it's not low and at that time we may have different recommendations.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA acknowledges that some participants may know their test results before enrolling and is open to accepting a portion of such participants in a study. They will provide guidance to evaluate and limit potential biases through data analysis and context-specific plans like pre-EUAs.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Would knowing their COVID-19 test results obtained at home before enrolling in a prospective study violate the study's requirements?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah, I can partially weigh in. I think we understand that-- I just said, there's a billion tests that have been provided to the US, and testing is commonplace now. I think we understand that some of your clinical trial participants may know their test result from the previous day or day before. And that's something that I think we are—we're willing to accept a portion of your study to be comprised of those people. We would have some guidance on trying to evaluate the bias-- the potential bias. Of course, if someone knows they're positive, they're really going to be looking closely for that positive test line on their visually read test. So, I think we can talk about how many is acceptable, what kind of data analysis we would recommend to look for bias. Of course, if it's a machine-read test, that's a different story. If that does change the bias evaluation; folks don't have to determine their own positive/negative test result. So like I said, I think a certain percentage, we're willing to kind of work with you on. But again, that would have to be in the context of a specific pre-EUA or test and clinical study plan just so we make sure we understand all of the different aspects of your study.

#### 12. Timeline for SARS-CoV-2 EUA Termination Uncertain

QA Block 12-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can the agency share insight on when the SARS EUA termination notice is expected to be published?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA does not currently have a date for the termination of the SARS-CoV-2 EUA declaration. There are two separate declarations affecting EUAs. The 319 declaration, under the Public Health Service Act, operates on a three-month renewal basis. The 564 EUA declaration, which authorizes emergency use products, remains in effect until explicitly terminated by the Secretary of HHS. No timeline is available, and some previous EUA declarations, like those for MERS and Zika, are still active.

There are two different declarations. There's the 319 determination under the Public Health Service Act, and then a separate declaration under Section 564 of the FD&C Act. That's the EUA declaration. These are independent. The 319 declaration is a three-month declaration, and then it has been extended every three months since it was first issued in January of 2020. And that will last for 90 days from each iteration, unless the Secretary extends it or proactively terminates it. And then separately, the 564 EUA declaration is what gives FDA the authority to issue emergency use authorizations. And that is in effect until the Secretary of HHS proactively terminates it, and we do not have a date for when that may happen.

QA Block 2-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can SARS-CoV-2 test developers use plasma and serum depleted of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as a negative control material for the development of new serological tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends using samples collected before December 2019 instead of plasma/serum depleted of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies due to potential changes in sample chemistry or content. Validate controls to avoid false results, submit significant control changes for FDA review, and consider alternative regulatory pathways for modifications outside EUA priorities.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can SARS-CoV-2 test developers use plasma and serum depleted of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as a negative control material for the development of new serological tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So generally we recommend that developers who hold an EUA authorization would first attempt to-- or who are seeking authorization would first attempt to obtain samples collected from prior to December 2019 from vendors and pull them to have enough volume for their testing. We would be concerned that depletion of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from samples may change the sample architecture or the antibody or protein content depending on the depletion method used. So sponsors would need to validate those controls to ensure that false results would not be reported as a result of changes to the composition of the controls. And significant changes to the control's chemistry or composition would need to be submitted to the FDA for review for those tests that have already been granted an EUA-- or issued an EUA. Additionally, we recommend that sponsors review the current policy to consider the FDA's current EUA review priorities, and if the changes that you're looking to make would not meet those review priorities, we would encourage you to pursue a traditional premarket review pathway, such as a de novo or a 510k.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the NIH-supported UMass Serial Antigen Testing Study eliminate the need for new or additional validation studies for EUAs related to serial testing?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The NIH-supported UMass study data is being utilized by the FDA for serial testing indications under EUAs, generally avoiding the need for additional studies to support serial testing.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the NIH-supported UMass Serial Antigen Testing Study eliminate the need for new or additional validation studies for EUAs related to serial testing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The results of the NIH-supported UMass study have been published, and we are leveraging that data in support of serial testing indications for EUAs. And that means that we've generally not requested additional studies to support serial testing for EUAs. One of the goals of that NIH-supported UMass study was to provide broadly applicable data to avoid the need for individual developers to perform large and expensive studies. And this has generally been quite successful for tests under EUA.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does FDA now require randomization for sample collection in OTC product studies?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA does not strongly require randomization for sample collection but allows various approaches, including randomization or adherence to a washout period between sample collections. Clinical plans should ensure proper performance across all tests.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does FDA now require randomization for sample collection in OTC product studies?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So I think the issue of users being taught how to collect an appropriate sample was something that we were concerned about earlier on in the pandemic. I think now we're in a different type of situation where literally a billion tests have been distributed to folks in the US, and certainly finding folks that are naive to self-swabbing is difficult and that's not something we are recommending. So, the concern of finding naive folks or being concerned with folks being trained by watching a health care provider take a nasal swab is much, much less of a concern now than it was quite some time ago. So, I think we are open to a number of different approaches. Randomization certainly is acceptable. I think what's important is to have a-- what we're calling a washout period or a sufficient period between the two samples being taken such that you're getting a good sample for both. In some cases, we have recommended taking the comparative first because that is really the most reflective of how a test will be used in practice. You're not going to take two swabs, you're only going to take one swab, so I think we would be open to that as well. I think the take-home here is that there's really no strong recommendation at this time as far as swab order other than be sure that you have a reasonable time period between the two swabs such that you get a good sample for both tests.

QA Block 12-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: When do you anticipate the SARS-CoV-2 EUA will be terminated?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA does not currently have a timeline for the termination of the SARS-CoV-2 EUA. There are two declarations involved: the 319 determination under the Public Health Service Act, which has been extended every three months since 2020, and the 564 declaration under the FD&C Act, which remains active until terminated by the HHS Secretary. Previous EUA declarations for diseases like MERS, Zika, and Ebola are still in effect.
VERBATIM QUESTION: When do you anticipate the SARS-CoV-2 EUA will be terminated?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah. So we don't have any data for that at the moment. We do have some information on our website that-- on our FAQ site, we do have some information about that. There are two different declarations. There's the 319 determination under the Public Health Service Act, and then a separate declaration under Section 564 of the FD&C Act. That's the EUA declaration. These are independent. The 319 declaration is a three-month declaration, and then it has been extended every three months since it was first issued in January of 2020. And that will last for 90 days from each iteration, unless the Secretary extends it or proactively terminates it. And then separately, the 564 EUA declaration is what gives FDA the authority to issue emergency use authorizations. And that is in effect until the Secretary of HHS proactively terminates it, and we do not have a date for when that may happen. You may be aware that there are many previous EUA declarations that are still in effect, such as MERS, Zika, Ebola. And so we don't have a timeline there.
