#### 1. FDA Guidance on COVID-19 Diagnostic Testing Policies

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does FDA require validation of test modifications for bridging studies to authorized tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA does not require a new or amended EUA for test modifications if they are validated through a bridging study to an EUA-authorized test. Validated changes can include modifications to platforms or components, with reliance on completed bridging studies by others.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does FDA require validation of test modifications for bridging studies to authorized tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: As noted in the March 16 guidance, we do not intend to object to the use of a test without a new or amended EUA if the test is validated using a bridging study to an EUA authorized test. So a lab can take an authorized test -- whether it's CDC's or somebody else -- make some changes to it -- whether it's a new platform, a new component -- and if they do the appropriate bridging study or rely on somebody else who has done a bridging sorry for that change, then they do not need to come in with an EUA or notification.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Elizabeth Hillebrenner (FDA)
TOPICS: Validation requirements, Bridging studies, Test modifications
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What constitutes an appropriate bridging study for test modifications?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA does not require a new or amended EUA for a test validated using a bridging study to an authorized test, if supported by data submitted via email. FDA may review and share this data publicly to support others using the same modification.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What constitutes an appropriate bridging study for test modifications?
VERBATIM ANSWER: As noted in the March 16 guidance, we do not intend to object to the use of a test without a new or amended EUA if the test is validated using a bridging study to an EUA authorized test. So a lab can take an authorized test -- whether it's CDC's or somebody else -- make some changes to it -- whether it's a new platform, a new component -- and if they do the appropriate bridging study or rely on somebody else who has done a bridging sorry for that change, then they do not need to come in with an EUA or notification. As noted in the guidance, we would like to see the validation data of that bridging study informally through an email to our CRH-EUA templates account. We would review that data, and if it does appear that it supports the modification, and if the laboratory or other entity who owns that data agrees to FDA sharing that information on our Web site, we would intend to update our Frequently Asked Questions site so that other labs can refer to that validation for their testing without having to conduct their own bridging study for the same modification.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Elizabeth Hillebrenner (FDA)
TOPICS: Bridging study, Test modifications, FDA validation requirements

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Under what conditions can an LDT or manufacturer avoid submitting a new EUA for a test modification?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: An LDT or manufacturer can avoid submitting a new EUA for a test modification if it is validated using a bridging study to an EUA-authorized test. Validation data should be sent informally to FDA, and the FDA may share the data if the owner agrees.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Under what conditions can an LDT or manufacturer avoid submitting a new EUA for a test modification?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So as noted in the March 16 guidance, we do not intend to object to the use of a test without a new or amended EUA if the test is validated using a bridging study to an EUA authorized test. So a lab can take an authorized test -- whether it's CDC's or somebody else -- make some changes to it -- whether it's a new platform, a new component -- and if they do the appropriate bridging study or rely on somebody else who has done a bridging study for that change, then they do not need to come in with an EUA or notification.

QA Block 1-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the process for a state to notify FDA about their decision to authorize laboratories for COVID-19 testing without FDA's involvement?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: States can notify FDA about their decision to authorize laboratories for COVID-19 testing by following Section B of the guidance, allowing them to develop and perform tests under their laws and notifying FDA of their decision. States must ensure that laboratories validate tests prior to clinical use.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the process for a state to notify FDA about their decision to authorize laboratories for COVID-19 testing without FDA's involvement?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Section B of the new guidance outlines the new policy for state authorization of CLIA high complexity labs to perform testing without submitting an EUA to FDA. So this section includes recommendations for states or territories regarding optionally choosing to authorize labs within their state or territory to develop and perform a test for coronavirus under authority of its own state law, and under whatever process that state or territory establishes. FDA will not be reviewing the process adopted by that state or territory, but we do expect that the oversight process would require laboratories to validate tests prior to use. FDA continues to believe that all tests need to be validated prior to clinical use. This guidance also includes recommendations that the state or territory notify FDA if they choose to use this flexibility to expedite testing in their state or territory. And we also encourage laboratories within such states or territories to notify us as well when they start clinical testing under this policy.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Elizabeth Hillebrenner (FDA)
TOPICS: State Authorization, Laboratory Testing, COVID-19 Diagnostics
REVIEW FLAG: False

VERBATIM QUESTION: How does FDA recommend presenting test limitations for serology tests on test reports?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Indicating in the test report information along the lines of the following: The test has not been reviewed by the FDA. Negative results do not rule out SARS-CoV2 infection, particularly in those who have been in contact with the virus. Follow-up testing with a molecular diagnostic should be considered to rule out infection in these individuals. Results from antibody testing should not be used as the sole basis to diagnose or exclude SARS-CoV2 infection or to inform infection status. Positive results may be due to past or present infection with non SARS-CoV2 coronavirus strains, such as a list of specific strains.

SPEAKER ANSWER: Elizabeth Hillebrenner (FDA)
TOPICS: Performance summary on websites, Manufacturer responsibilities, FDA validation status
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-8
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What information must developers include when notifying the FDA about starting clinical use of serology tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Developers notifying the FDA about starting clinical use of serology tests must validate the test beforehand and include this information: the test has not been reviewed by the FDA; negative results do not rule out SARS-CoV2 infection and require follow-up molecular tests; results should not solely diagnose or exclude infection; and positive results may be due to SARS-CoV2 or other coronavirus strains.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What information must developers include when notifying the FDA about starting clinical use of serology tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The recommendations here include of course validating the newly developed serology tests that detects antibodies to the coronavirus prior to clinical use, again, notifying FDA when clinical use of a validated test begins, and indicating in the test report information along the lines of the following. The test has not been reviewed by the FDA. Negative results do not rule out SARS-CoV2 infection, particularly in those who have been in contact with the virus. Follow-up testing with a molecular diagnostic should be considered to rule out infection in these individuals. Results from antibody testing should not be used as the sole basis to diagnose or exclude SARS-CoV2 infection or to inform infection status. Positive results may be due to past or present infection with non SARS-CoV2 coronavirus strains, such as a list of specific strains.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA does not have authority over this; it falls under CMS. Parties can approach CMS for guidance, potentially to expand CLIA licenses or expedite applications for facilities to become CLIA labs.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is there any guidance coming from the FDA to states regarding allowing CLIA waivers or activating ISO 17025 BSL-2 certified labs to expand capacity?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, it's actually not under the FDA's authority. It would be under CMS. And I know that a number of interested parties have approached CMS, so you may want to approach CMS with this question as well. My understanding is that there - that you could - and I can't speak for CMS, but one of the things you could ask for is if you have an existing laboratory CLIA license and you want to expand that to include additional personnel or space, you could potentially ask that question. I can't promise a response. And then if you are a facility that would like to become a CLIA lab, you can make an application for that, and ask if that can't be expedited.

#### 7. EUA Pathways and Requirements for Serology Tests

QA Block 7-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the process for serology tests related to EUA and notifying the FDA?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: There are two pathways for serology tests. One involves notifying the FDA without submitting an EUA when detecting IGG or IGM antibodies. For claims as a sole diagnostic, submission to the EUA process is required. Following Section D, no EUA is needed for commercial manufacturing and distribution.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the process for serology tests related to EUA and notifying the FDA?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, so there's two different pathways for serology tests. One is just notify and don't submit an EUA - and that's for a test where you are just reporting the presence of IGG or IGM antibody. If you wish to make a claim as a sole diagnostic, then we would want you to come in to the EUA process. So if you look for that section - and I'm not sure if I can pull it up right now quickly. There is a section where it's just notifying us. See if I can - I'm pulling that up now. Yes, so commercial manufacturing development distribution for use of a serology test without an EUA. It's Section D. So if you follow everything in Section D, you do not need to come in with an EUA.

#### 12. FDA Guidance on Sample Types and Validation Requirements

QA Block 12-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are we to assume that the FDA has done any kind of validation on the sample types listed?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends performing validations for any new specimen type not listed on its FAQ page. The FAQ page specifies allowed sample types and highlights where data is insufficient. Decisions are made based on scientific evidence, including nasopharyngeal swabs being the preferred option, with mid-turbinate and anterior nares swabs now seen as equivalent based on study data.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are we to assume that the FDA has done any kind of validation on the sample types listed?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. First on the five and five question - we didn't really go down to that granularity. But it wouldn't hurt to - so we said first five positive and five negative. So I would follow that advice. And then - I mean, certainly if you had any questions about whether that applied to a more challenging specimen, you could do that as well. But I would assume that any new specimen type that is not listed as allowed on our FAQ page, that you would do a validation for, and then you would have validation data that would support the use of that sample type. I would say that we've tried to be very clear on the FAQ page as far as sample types, and where there is insufficient data to recommend something, we made that clear. But as of late on Monday night -- very late -- we updated it to say that while nasopharyngeal or NP swabs are still the preferred swab of choice, you can now do mid-turbinate and anterior nares -- or the lower nose -- in addition. And those appear to us to be -- looking at study data, which is not public yet, but which United Health Group will hopefully publish very soon -- looks equivalent in performance to nasopharyngeal swabs. So we do make these decisions based on scientific - sound science and data when we have it, and the literature when the literature is appropriate.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is it possible for non-CLIA labs to be activated to expand testing capacity?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA does not have authority over this; it falls under CMS. You could ask CMS about expanding an existing CLIA license or expediting an application to become a CLIA lab.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is it possible for non-CLIA labs to be activated to expand testing capacity?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, it's actually not under the FDA's authority. It would be under CMS. And I know that a number of interested parties have approached CMS, so you may want to approach CMS with this question as well. My understanding is that there - that you could - and I can't speak for CMS, but one of the things you could ask for is if you have an existing laboratory CLIA license and you want to expand that to include additional personnel or space, you could potentially ask that question. I can't promise a response. And then if you are a facility that would like to become a CLIA lab, you can make an application for that, and ask if that can't be expedited. So again, I cannot speak for CMS, but those are at least two potential pathways you might pursue in discussions with them. Hopefully that's helpful. But again, this is not under the FDA's authority about where the testing is done. That is CMS.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What criteria should be used when validating an EUA-authorized assay on non-authorized equipment to ensure compliance?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends validating an EUA-authorized assay on new equipment to ensure compliance. Confirming the first five positives and negatives with a fully EUA-authorized assay could be helpful but is not mandatory.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What criteria should be used when validating an EUA-authorized assay on non-authorized equipment to ensure compliance?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So as Elizabeth explained, you're welcome to share the data the bridging study data, but if you're using an EUA-authorized kit and you're validating it for a new piece of equipment, as long as everything validates well, go ahead and do that. Since it is - you are validating something new, it wouldn't hurt to go ahead and just confirm the first five positives and first five negatives with someone else who is already set up and using a completely EUA-authorized assay as a check. But I don't know - I wouldn't say right here and now that it's required. Yes, if you were developing your own LBT from scratch and doing it, that's clearly something that we want you to do. But I would not require it for you using an EUA-authorized test. If you want to voluntarily share that validation data with us -- as Elizabeth mentioned -- we'll make that available to more folks if everything looks good.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: Yes, Section D addresses serology tests that do not require EUA for reporting IGG or IGM antibodies. Following Section D's guidelines allows usage without an EUA.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does Section D address serology tests that do not require EUA?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, so there's two different pathways for serology tests. One is just notify and don't submit an EUA - and that's for a test where you are just reporting the presence of IGG or IGM antibody. If you wish to make a claim as a sole diagnostic, then we would want you to come in to the EUA process. So if you look for that section - and I'm not sure if I can pull it up right now quickly. There is a section where it's just notifying us. See if I can - I'm pulling that up now. Yes, so commercial manufacturing development distribution for use of a serology test without an EUA. It's Section D. So if you follow everything in Section D, you do not need to come in with an EUA.
