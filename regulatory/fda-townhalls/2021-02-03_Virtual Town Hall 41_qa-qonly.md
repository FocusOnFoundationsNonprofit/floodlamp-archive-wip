#### 1. FDA Updates and Guidance on SARS-CoV-2 Test Validation

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What types of decisions related to EUAs are being counted in the FDA's daily metrics?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA's daily metrics for EUAs include original authorizations, supplements and amendments to existing EUAs, pre-EUA feedback, and negative decisions. Updates to existing EUAs can be found via the FDA website.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What types of decisions related to EUAs are being counted in the FDA's daily metrics?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We are currently over the last week averaging about nine decisions. That's N- I-N-E, nine a day. And some of these are of course new original authorizations. They pop up as a new authorization on our FDA Web site. Many of them though are also supplements and amendments to existing EUAs. These don't - these aren't so easily spotted when we make these decisions. But if you go to a given assay and you click on the plus sign for that - on the web site you'll see all of the updates to their authorizations which are the supplements and amendments. Also we consider a decision in our accounting when they issue and close out a pre-EUA feedback. And then of course there are negative decisions and those we don't publicize typically, nor do we publicize, you know, when we close out a pre-EUA submission and give feedback to the developer.

#### 2. FDA Guidance on Smartphone Use for Test Interpretation

QA Block 2-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is FDA's current thinking about whether acceptable performance from a clinical study with one representative iPhone model could allow other mobile phone models and operating systems meeting the initial set of critical smartphone specifications to be considered acceptable for use as alternative devices?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA may require some additional data on other smartphone models even if the clinical study is performed with only one model. A full clinical study may not always be necessary; a comparison study across models might suffice. Further guidance can be obtained through the pre-EUA process to address specific risks.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is FDA's current thinking about whether acceptable performance from a clinical study with one representative iPhone model could allow other mobile phone models and operating systems meeting the initial set of critical smartphone specifications to be considered acceptable for use as alternative devices?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So for reporting purposes it is not a requirement for an EUA authorization, at least the time of authorization to have a reporting feature. However in what you described we want to make sure on doing the review that the smart phone that you used to capture an analyze the image for determining whether something is positive or negative is accurate and reliable. And so obviously different smart phones are going to have different cameras and different software. So it would be important for us to take a look at what the risks are for using something that's not used in a clinical study. So I can't promise you that we wouldn't ask for some additional data on additional models or manufacturers if you're willing to allow them in your test. However that may not always require necessarily that you do a clinical study but you do some sort of comparison study between the different cell phone models. So that - your question is a great and important one and it's best answered specifically with one of our reviewers through our pre-EUA process. So I wanted to give you at least some flavor of what we've been thinking about and what's important that would help you formulate your questions to our reviewer.

#### 3. PCR vs Antigen Testing: Accuracy, Applications, and FDA Perspective

QA Block 3-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the FDA's current thinking on PCR versus antigen tests and when they could be optimally used?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA supports both molecular and antigen tests, considering their strengths and weaknesses. Molecular tests are generally more sensitive and can detect infections even after the infectious period is over, whereas antigen tests are less sensitive but better at identifying contagious individuals. Molecular tests are better suited for high-complexity labs, while antigen tests are more scalable and easier to use in point-of-care and home settings.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the FDA's current thinking on PCR versus antigen tests and when they could be optimally used?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Regarding molecular versus antigen, obviously we support both. From the FDA perspective our job is to take a look at the different technologies that can be brought to bear to help this pandemic and make sure that they are accurate and safe to use and that's our main consideration. We're very supportive of all types of testing whether it's molecular, molecular point-of-care, molecular center lab, central lab or antigen point-of-care, antigen home, molecular home, molecular OTC, antigen OTC. So we see that they're all able to assist in this pandemic. We know that in general molecular assays are more sensitive than antigen assays and there are some - therefore some trade-offs both ways. I mean some people have said molecular assays are too sensitive, you know. And I think, you know, if you're looking at asymptomatic people and you don't know when they got infected a molecular test might identify somebody, you know, a week or two or more after they became infected and maybe they're not as infectious or are not infectious any longer versus antigen tests which are usually require more intact virus and aren't as sensitive. Probably, you know, the good ones are, and the ones I think that we've authorized are good ones, are probably better able to tell, you know, who are the patients that are positive and truly positive. You know, those are probably patients that you want to make sure that you take appropriate measures to make sure that they don't transmit that to somebody else. So the other thing is, you know, for central lab testing especially very high throughput, you know, unless you have an instrument that - and we have authorized one central lab antigen test, you know, and that's fairly high- volume but it's a lot easier to make the molecular test and do it in large volumes in a central lab. But obviously a central lab is the high complexity lab environment and, you know, a point of care clinic, you know, would, you know, not be able to do a high complexity lab test but they can do waived or a deemed waived test. And so and also at home it would be similar sort of easy to use. And it's a lot easier to make an antigen test point of care and a minimal to home than a molecular for obvious reasons.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Greg Slovatkin
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: PCR vs. antigen tests, optimal test usage, sensitivity differences
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 3-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Why is FDA still issuing EUAs that require a prescription for a test when there is a desperate need for mass testing?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA issues EUAs requiring prescriptions to mitigate risks and ensure accurate testing by involving clinicians. They have authorized over-the-counter tests for developers who complete additional validation.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Why is FDA still issuing EUAs that require a prescription for a test when there is a desperate need for mass testing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So Rx let's start with that is a mitigation on risk. So if patients, you know, don't have a clinician involved with interpreting the test then we look at other mitigations to ensure accurate testing and that the reading of the test and the interpretation of the test is also good in the hands of the consumer. So we are in - or we've authorized OTC tests that are without prescription. And so we are clearly very open to it. But we do ask for additional validation work for that. And, you know, as long as developers are willing to do those extra steps we're willing to give an over-the-counter claim to that assay.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Greg Slovatkin
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: EUA requirements, Prescription testing, Over-the-counter testing
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 3-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the FDA still maintain that there is a higher chance of false negatives for antigen tests compared to molecular tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA confirms that antigen tests are more likely to produce false negatives, especially in symptomatic individuals within the first 5-7 days of symptoms, compared to a good central molecular test. This is why antigen test labeling states negatives as presumed negative.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA still maintain that there is a higher chance of false negatives for antigen tests compared to molecular tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Oh very clearly antigen tests are more likely to have false negatives especially in important false negatives, especially in the first, you know, zero - day zero to day five or day zero to day seven. Performance is clearly lower in that period of time for symptomatic people than a real good central molecular test. So you're going to have negative results with an antigen test that will be on somebody who's symptomatic and has SARS. And you'd have to do a lot of hand waving to convince me that somebody in the first few days is symptomatic infection can't be infectious. And they're going to be falsely negative as sometimes in an antigen test, less likely to be false-negative with a good central molecular test. So it's why our labeling for antigen tests all say the negatives are presumed negative rather than negative.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Greg Slovatkin
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: False negatives in COVID-19 tests, Antigen vs Molecular tests
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 3-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What additional validation work is required to obtain over-the-counter (OTC) authorization for a test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA requires additional validation work to ensure that OTC tests are accurate and can be interpreted correctly by consumers without clinician involvement. Developers who complete these steps can obtain OTC authorization.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What additional validation work is required to obtain over-the-counter (OTC) authorization for a test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So Rx let's start with that is a mitigation on risk. So if patients, you know, don't have a clinician involved with interpreting the test then we look at other mitigations to ensure accurate testing and that the reading of the test and the interpretation of the test is also good in the hands of the consumer. So we are in - or we've authorized OTC tests that are without prescription. And so we are clearly very open to it. But we do ask for additional validation work for that.

TOPICS: OTC test authorization, Validation requirements
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 3-5
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are there specific strengths and weaknesses of central lab antigen testing versus central lab molecular testing that developers should consider?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA states that molecular assays are generally more sensitive than antigen assays, making molecular tests useful for identifying infections even late or in asymptomatic individuals, whereas antigen tests may better identify infectious individuals. Central lab molecular tests are easier for high-volume processing than antigen tests.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are there specific strengths and weaknesses of central lab antigen testing versus central lab molecular testing that developers should consider?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We know that in general molecular assays are more sensitive than antigen assays and there are some - therefore some trade-offs both ways.

REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 3-6
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How does the FDA view the trade-offs between the sensitivity of molecular tests and the situational usefulness of antigen tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA supports both molecular and antigen tests, recognizing their different sensitivities and situational uses. Molecular tests are generally more sensitive, detecting infections even when individuals may no longer be infectious, while antigen tests are better at identifying actively infectious individuals. The FDA assesses each test to ensure accuracy and safety.

QA Block 3-8
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are there technological challenges unique to creating point-of-care or home-use molecular tests compared to antigen tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Antigen tests are easier to create for point-of-care or home use compared to molecular tests. Additionally, when manufactured reliably, they can achieve extremely high production volumes, unlike molecular tests.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are there technological challenges unique to creating point-of-care or home-use molecular tests compared to antigen tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: And it's a lot easier to make an antigen test point of care and a minimal to home than a molecular for obvious reasons. The other thing an advantage that antigen test can have is when they're good and they can be manufactured reliably which is a hard thing to do, they can be made in the millions of tests per month or more. I mean you've seen the press reports from some of the manufacturers upwards of 50 million and maybe going up to 100 million tests from a single manufacturer, single antigen test per month.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What considerations determine whether a test is waived or deemed waived for point-of-care use?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Tests deemed waived for point-of-care use must be easy to use, as high-complexity lab tests cannot be conducted in such settings.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What considerations determine whether a test is waived or deemed waived for point-of-care use?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Obviously a central lab is the high complexity lab environment and, you know, a point of care clinic, you know, would, you know, not be able to do a high complexity lab test but they can do waived or a deemed waived test. And so and also at home it would be similar sort of easy to use.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is the FDA monitoring production scalability when authorizing antigen tests, and if so, how does it evaluate this capability?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recognizes that manufacturing reliable antigen tests is challenging but sees their potential for large-scale production, possibly up to 100 million per month from some manufacturers, far surpassing molecular test production.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is the FDA monitoring production scalability when authorizing antigen tests, and if so, how does it evaluate this capability?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The other thing an advantage that antigen test can have is when they're good and they can be manufactured reliably which is a hard thing to do, they can be made in the millions of tests per month or more. I mean you've seen the press reports from some of the manufacturers upwards of 50 million and maybe going up to 100 million tests from a single manufacturer, single antigen test per month. And those are volumes that, you know, are potentially order - in order or orders of magnitude greater than what the molecular manufactures and obviously individual labs, you know, central labs can test for.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the agency's expectations around system validation or updating after major updates to a smartphone operating system?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA expects test developers to monitor for smartphone OS updates and maintain relationships with manufacturers to prepare for changes. If test performance is affected, the FDA should be notified immediately. Developers should also discuss plans for managing OS updates during their EUA submission to possibly enable built-in change control for updates.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the agency's expectations around system validation or updating after major updates to a smartphone operating system?
VERBATIM ANSWER: I think it's just, you know, a wise thing to do for a test developer to monitor that. I mean ideally a test developer would have relationships with the manufacturers of phones or sellers of phones that they're using so that they can know ahead of time when an update might be coming. You know, but if suddenly an update is made and it changes the performance of your test the FDA is going to want to know that right away. And if you're giving now inaccurate results out, you know, then that's - that would be a public health of public health importance.

#### 6. Antigen Test Validation for Nasal or Nasopharyngeal Swabs

QA Block 6-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is it true for antigen tests that if a test is validated for NP swabs, it can also be used for anterior nasal swabs without additional validation?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: For antigen tests, additional validation with patient data is needed for anterior nasal swabs due to sensitivity differences between nasopharyngeal and anterior samples. FDA encourages validation for more user-friendly swab types like anterior nares or mid-turbinate swabs.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is it true for antigen tests that if a test is validated for NP swabs, it can also be used for anterior nasal swabs without additional validation?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes to talk specifically about the antigen test yes we would ask to see patient data for anterior nasal swab. And the antigen tests are less sensitive. They're more sensitive to differences in viral loads that might happen between the nasopharynx and the anterior. So and it's important to understand that performance difference. Now we're not requiring for an antigen test that they do a nasopharyngeal swab. A matter of fact I encourage most to try to validate and get their recommended sensitivity with anterior nares or, you know, worst-case mid- turbinate swabs because those are much better tolerated. They can be if you validate it for self-collection they can be self-collected. They are then amenable if you have a good antigen test and it's easy to use for home use either prescription or over-the-counter.

#### 7. Guidance for COVID Breath Test Development and Sensitivity Requirements

QA Block 7-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Do you have any updates or current thoughts on the PPA or sensitivity requirements for a breath test for screening COVID?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA's current thinking is that the benefit-risk balance of breath tests favors use in asymptomatic populations, requiring high sensitivity. Novel technology like this might need more positive cases for approval compared to antigen or molecular tests. Cross-reactivity testing would involve symptomatic individuals undergoing SARS and respiratory panel testing. Additional details can be provided via email.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Do you have any updates or current thoughts on the PPA or sensitivity requirements for a breath test for screening COVID?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes we do. I can give you some of our current thinking and philosophy as it comes to breath test. This is all still being developed so I wouldn't - but I think our team can provide you with even more specifics if you sent an email to the templates email mailbox. But I want to point you in sort of the flavor of where we're going here so you understand and can ask good questions hopefully. One is when you think about the benefit risk of a breath test and in aiding in this pandemic, you know, if somebody is symptomatic versus somebody who is asymptomatic, the benefit risk favors testing the asymptomatic populations with a novel device such as this, especially if it has a high sensitivity in the asymptomatic population. You know, if someone's symptomatic and it's a totally novel device when they're, you know, when they're, you know, when the concern about finding positive people is more moving into the asymptomatic population now as we try to control the spread of disease. If someone's symptomatic they should be isolating, you know, and masking and all those things and get tests but if the tests don't make sense then. So the benefit risk really favors using the breath test in the asymptomatic population. We would want to see that, you know, it has a relatively high sensitivity in asymptomatic population. And since this is a novel technology and we don't have the same sort of experience, you know, even with other respiratory viruses like we do with molecular and antigen we will probably want to see more positives in the asymptomatic population than we would ask for an antigen or a molecular test for authorization of asymptomatic screening because we want to make sure it's not going to be, you know, orders of magnitude more. It's just going to be a little bit more but we think still reasonable. And the other thing is with a breath test it's really hard to do cross-reactivity testing. Now first of all the actual analyte isn't the virus or other viruses. It's, you know, volatiles. And so how do you get at cross reactivity? And really the only way we could think of that's very doable and will allow developers like yourself to move forward is to test symptomatic people with a SARS test and also a respiratory panel test. Both should be authorized. There are some respiratory panels that have - and they've been authorized that have SARS on it so it would be one test. But you test, you know, a sufficient number of symptomatic people, somewhere around maybe 5% or 10%, maybe 10% of them are going to have SARS today of the symptomatic population. The rest of them are going to have some other respiratory disease, mostly viral, you know, rhino non-novel corona, et cetera, RSV, some flu, et cetera. So you should without having to test that many patients you should be able to see, you know, and a good panel that would detect most of the non-SARS viruses that are infecting patients these days and causing symptoms, you wouldn't take that many patients who are symptomatic with this kind of comparison study to show if a breath test is specific for SARS or not. So that's our current thinking. If you send us an email at our templates email address for an update on our current recommendations and thinking for breath tests, we can provide you with some more information than we have in the past okay?

So you should without having to test that many patients you should be able to see, you know, and a good panel that would detect most of the non-SARS viruses that are infecting patients these days and causing symptoms, you wouldn't take that many patients who are symptomatic with this kind of comparison study to show if a breath test is specific for SARS or not.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can testing a respiratory panel authorized for SARS and other viruses satisfy the cross-reactivity requirement?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA suggests that testing a respiratory panel authorized for SARS and other viruses in symptomatic patients could meet cross-reactivity requirements for a breath test.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can testing a respiratory panel authorized for SARS and other viruses satisfy the cross-reactivity requirement?
VERBATIM ANSWER: And the other thing is with a breath test it's really hard to do cross-reactivity testing. Now first of all the actual analyte isn't the virus or other viruses. It's, you know, volatiles. And so how do you get at cross reactivity? And really the only way we could think of that's very doable and will allow developers like yourself to move forward is to test symptomatic people with a SARS test and also a respiratory panel test. Both should be authorized. There are some respiratory panels that have - and they've been authorized that have SARS on it so it would be one test. But you test, you know, a sufficient number of symptomatic people, somewhere around maybe 5% or 10%, maybe 10% of them are going to have SARS today of the symptomatic population.

#### 8. Smartphone-Based Reader Tests: FDA Recommendations and Validation Approach

QA Block 8-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the FDA have a standardized list of hardware requirement categories for a test system that includes a smartphone, such as processor type or camera, or is it up to the test developer to provide and justify their list of requirements?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA does not provide a standardized list of hardware requirements for smartphone-based test systems. Test developers are expected to define and validate the necessary parameters based on their specific test needs and submit this information for FDA evaluation.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA have a standardized list of hardware requirement categories for a test system that includes a smartphone, such as processor type or camera, or is it up to the test developer to provide and justify their list of requirements?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes I mean we take an open-minded approach and we - to this. So we don't really know what the needs of your tests are, right? You know it better than we do as far as the requirements on whatever the variables are when it comes to smart phones and cameras and image analysis. We also don't specify that you have to use a smart phone to read a test, right? But I'm trying to think if we have actually authorized a smartphone reader for SARS or anything. I don't remember that we have. So as was usual with something that's novel -- and we're totally open to it -- we learn a lot with the first developers who come to us with data and learn a lot about what our recommendations for others would be based on actual data. It's really hard to, you know, we do have a research branch in our center who could look at something like this but they aren't to my knowledge at the moment. They have so many, you know, interesting things to study but and one of those is actually digital health so or digital technology rather which is an image scanner and analysis of tissue. So they - we do have a program there and that's probably the most amenable thing that we understand relative to this. But the - there's a whole lot of variables when it comes into scanners of a rapid test, lateral flow test, you know, from what is the color of the line to the thickness of the line to the lighting to the background. And obviously different cameras or different software may impact that. So you're really the best ones to inform us based on your examination of different smart phone options and your test what's going to work best and how you define that. And then we'll look at your validation when you define those parameters and determine if that is something we can authorize.

#### 9. CDC Antigen Test Panel Testing Status Update

QA Block 9-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Has there been an update on the reference panel testing by the CDC for EUA authorized antigen tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The CDC is nearing the start of reference panel testing but is delayed due to other missions. Alternative approaches are being considered, and developers might use certain inactivated viral strains for testing. However, preparation of these strains by BEI will take time.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Has there been an update on the reference panel testing by the CDC for EUA authorized antigen tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, I think they're getting relatively near to starting. But, you know, the CDC is inundated with mission requests. And we are currently thinking of other options and looking into them. And we don't have what I would call a great option right now. For those developers that can utilize in their assays the various strains that have been deposited, BEI and either have been heat inactivated or perhaps more appropriately irradiated and inactivated through radiation that may be more amenable to antigen tests, you know, we're going to be reaching out. There is - we have some preliminary data within the federal government that says that irradiated SARS can be accurately detected by antigen tests. So but I don't know if that would be across the board for all antigen test developers or not if their test is sensitive to radiation of the virus or not as far as reactivity and inclusivity testing goes. But if they - it is amenable to all or most. One option is that once these strains deposited at BEI and have been inactivated by one or another method those developers that don't have BSL-3 facilities can get that material and perform the testing. So we're just working through that. The downside I'll just say to that is it takes BEI a while to inactivate virus. And obviously they don't just, you know, irradiate it or heat denature it. Then they go ahead and test it to make sure that it is non-infection or noninfectious. So it's not something that they can rush through and do. So we're hoping long- term the inactivated virus material that BEI manufacturers will be useful to this effort. So that's our current thinking as of today.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Have antigen test submissions from companies using Chinese OEMs shown a pattern of failing to meet FDA requirements for home use, such as 90% sensitivity?
VERBATIM ANSWER: I would, you know, as far as manufacturers of antigen tests go, here is the maybe not well kept secret or maybe it is a secret that it's a lot harder to develop a good antigen test than it is to develop a good molecular test. Now, you know, I've developed both and I can tell you it's a lot easier to develop a good molecular test than a good antigen test. And it's also much easier to manufacture molecular tests then antigen tests and I've done both. So that's probably more of a factor here. Lateral flow tests and, you know, there's serology in antigen tests. I'll let you know. I mean we're declining 2/3 of serology tests that are coming, lateral flow serology tests based on NCI data, 2/3. We're only authorizing 1/3 that test at - tests performed at NCI and reviewed by the FDA. I think that's the nature or the difficulty in making really super high quality, quality high enough for the US market from the lateral flow business. And it probably is the same in antigens. I know we've denied some antigen tests. I haven't done the numbers as far as the ratio goes.

QA Block 10-7
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What factors contribute to the lower approval rate for lateral flow serology and antigen tests compared to molecular tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The lower approval rate for lateral flow serology and antigen tests compared to molecular tests is due to the greater difficulty in developing and manufacturing high-quality lateral flow-based tests. Approximately two-thirds of serology tests fail to meet FDA requirements, and the ratio is likely similar for antigen tests.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What factors contribute to the lower approval rate for lateral flow serology and antigen tests compared to molecular tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: I would, you know, as far as manufacturers of antigen tests go, here is the maybe not well kept secret or maybe it is a secret that it's a lot harder to develop a good antigen test than it is to develop a good molecular test. Now, you know, I've developed both and I can tell you it's a lot easier to develop a good molecular test than a good antigen test. And it's also much easier to manufacture molecular tests then antigen tests and I've done both. So that's probably more of a factor here. Lateral flow tests and, you know, there's serology in antigen tests. I'll let you know. I mean we're declining 2/3 of serology tests that are coming, lateral flow serology tests based on NCI data, 2/3. We're only authorizing 1/3 that test at - tests performed at NCI and reviewed by the FDA.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA require distinct criteria for the US market versus other global markets regarding antigen tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: As far as foreign OEMs we treat everybody fairly. We make decisions based on data and the quality of the submission. It doesn't matter where it comes from. And we haven't authorize that many antigen tests compared to molecular tests, but very clearly we've authorize the molecular and serology tests from many countries of the world including China.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is it necessary to include a mechanism in the app to estimate the prevalence in the consumer's region to provide indications on positive and negative predictive value for the test results?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recognizes that a consumer's region prevalence could affect PPV and NPV, but implementing such a mechanism would require precise and up-to-date data, as well as an adaptable system with a geo-locator feature. Developers can propose this in a pre-EUA or EUA submission.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is it necessary to include a mechanism in the app to estimate the prevalence in the consumer's region to provide indications on positive and negative predictive value for the test results?
VERBATIM ANSWER: It's an interesting question. Certainly in a low prevalence population your risk - your PPV is going to go down, your Positive Predictive Value's going to go down but your NPV is going to go up. But we've heard that false positives with antigen tests especially in point-of-care congregant settings where then they move a patient based on their test results into a COVID ward can expose someone who doesn't really have COVID to SARS and developing COVID. So it's a complex thing. The other thing is and obviously if you're prevalence is higher then it's kind of the reverse. But, you know, one of the challenges with that is you'd have to have - first of all you'd have to have, you know, even to consider it you'd have to have really good prevalence data and up to the minute prevalence data which we don't have. And then you'd have to have an adaptable system that had some geo-locator that says well you're in this ZIP Code and this is the prevalence and so this is the number to use, you know, for your mitigation. So it's an interesting idea and I don't want to give you any more definitive - I don't want to give you any definitive answer on it. We're always open to new ideas. So if you want to propose this in a pre-EUA or an EUA as the mitigation please do. I can't guarantee the results. But like I said, you know, this town hall is to help educate folks about our current thinking. But we learn just as much from developers, you know, as you do from us.

#### 13. Differentiating Diagnostic, Screening, and Surveillance COVID-19 Testing

QA Block 13-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is there any issue with using already distributed antigen tests for our organization's surveillance testing?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA does not regulate surveillance testing. Antigen tests are typically single-use for individual patients, making them challenging to use for surveillance testing, which is population-based and often involves pooling. In case of a positive pool, individuals should be directed for further testing in CLIA labs.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is there any issue with using already distributed antigen tests for our organization's surveillance testing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So well yes so it's a bit complicated. So first of all the FDA has tried to provide some clarity on this on our FAQs with regard to what is diagnostic testing what is screening, asymptomatic screening testing...and what is surveillance testing and has clearly said that for COVID-19 at least the FDA is not going to be regulating surveillance testing. So but one of the challenges which you mentioned with the antigen test is it's a single use for typically for a single patient. And it's hard to do purely surveillance testing when you have one patient and one result and it's right there in the patient sees the result or is the test itself. So that isn't, you know, when a patient gets a results back or an employee gets the results back that tells them that their positive or negative that is not what we would typically think of it as surveillance testing. Surveillance testing is population-based. Typically it uses pooling. And then if you have a positive pool at least the FDA current thinking on this, is that if it's positive pool you can say to that pool of people, go get a CLIA lab test and get a results.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: If a manufacturer validates their kit for NP swabs, do they also need to include anterior nasal swab testing in the validation for antigen tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA requires validation with patient data for anterior nasal swabs for antigen tests due to differences in viral loads. Validation for anterior nasal or mid-turbinate swabs is encouraged, as they are better tolerated and more practical for self-collection and home use.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If a manufacturer validates their kit for NP swabs, do they also need to include anterior nasal swab testing in the validation for antigen tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes to talk specifically about the antigen test yes we would ask to see patient data for anterior nasal swab. And the antigen tests are less sensitive. They're more sensitive to differences in viral loads that might happen between the nasopharynx and the anterior. So and it's important to understand that performance difference. Now we're not requiring for an antigen test that they do a nasopharyngeal swab. A matter of fact I encourage most to try to validate and get their recommended sensitivity with anterior nares or, you know, worst-case mid-turbinate swabs because those are much better tolerated. They can be if you validate it for self-collection they can be self-collected. They are then amenable if you have a good antigen test and it's easy to use for home use either prescription or over-the-counter. So, you know, whereas, you know, a consumer cannot perform nasopharyngeal swab on themselves, at least not safely.

QA Block 7-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Why does the FDA recommend targeting asymptomatic populations specifically for novel breath tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends targeting asymptomatic populations for novel breath tests because the benefit-risk balance favors aiding in pandemic control by identifying positive cases in individuals who may spread the disease unknowingly. High sensitivity in asymptomatic cases is crucial for these devices.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Why does the FDA recommend targeting asymptomatic populations specifically for novel breath tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes we do. I can give you some of our current thinking and philosophy as it comes to breath test. This is all still being developed so I wouldn't - but I think our team can provide you with even more specifics if you sent an email to the templates email mailbox. But I want to point you in sort of the flavor of where we're going here so you understand and can ask good questions hopefully. One is when you think about the benefit risk of a breath test and in aiding in this pandemic, you know, if somebody is symptomatic versus somebody who is asymptomatic, the benefit risk favors testing the asymptomatic populations with a novel device such as this, especially if it has a high sensitivity in the asymptomatic population. You know, if someone's symptomatic and it's a totally novel device when they're, you know, when they're, you know, when the concern about finding positive people is more moving into the asymptomatic population now as we try to control the spread of disease. If someone's symptomatic they should be isolating, you know, and masking and all those things and get tests but if the tests don't make sense then. So the benefit risk really favors using the breath test in the asymptomatic population. We would want to see that, you know, it has a relatively high sensitivity in asymptomatic population.
