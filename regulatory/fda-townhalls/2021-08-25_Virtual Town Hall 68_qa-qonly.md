QA Block 1-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How does the FDA define high-priority diagnostic tests that greatly expand access?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA prioritizes high-volume central lab tests, point-of-care tests, and home diagnostic tests that improve access, fully quantitative serology tests traceable to WHO standards, and neutralizing antibody tests.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How does the FDA define high-priority diagnostic tests that greatly expand access?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Our clear priorities for review are diagnostic tests that greatly expand access. These are very high volume central lab tests or point-of-care tests and home tests and home collection for diagnostic assays. There are some serology tests that are clear priorities. And they are fully quantitative serology tests that are traceable to the WHO international standard. This will really help us move forward and inform on whether or not there's a level of antibody that is able to provide complete immunity and/or protection. Neutralizing antibody tests are also a clear priority as well, although that may not always correlate with the development of some immunity or protection.

#### 2. FDA Efforts to Prioritize COVID Test Availability

QA Block 2-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the FDA doing during the EUA process to help meet the increased demand for point-of-care and home COVID-19 tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA has prioritized point-of-care and home diagnostic tests for a long time, authorizing many already. While manufacturing volumes for these tests can be increased, the FDA does not have control over production but continues to prioritize reviews.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the FDA doing during the EUA process to help meet the increased demand for point-of-care and home COVID-19 tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So for anybody who's a regular attendee of these town halls, you know that diagnostic tests in particular and those that are point-of-care and home have been a clear priority for a very long time and even home collection. And we have authorized quite a few of these, of course, already. And there really is no reason that manufacturing volumes of these already-authorized tests cannot be scaled up.

#### 3. Sample Size and Vaccination Considerations for Antibody Test Studies

QA Block 3-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the potential inclusion of both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals affect the sample size considerations for total antibody test validation studies?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends excluding vaccinated individuals from SARS-CoV-2 serology clinical studies and advises using at least 30 positive and 75 negative samples. For negative samples, pre-pandemic banked specimens or fresh samples are acceptable.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the potential inclusion of both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals affect the sample size considerations for total antibody test validation studies?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Our recommendations are recommendations, not requirements. And if you want to move away from what we recommend, we do encourage you to check with us first, the pre-EUA process. However, the sample size of 30 positives and 75 negative are pretty much the bare minimum. We approached EUAs relatively early in the EUA process. That's why we moved, for example, for diagnostic assays, for prior pandemics, we often asked for 50 positives and 50 negatives per EUAs. And we moved relatively quickly to 30 positives and 30 negatives, since samples were not available. And we allowed contrived samples. I know that there are, unfortunately, a lot of samples available now. And in the past, we moved to actual clinical samples. So those sizes are set based on statistics and being able to, at least at a bare minimum under the EUA authority, establish performance estimates for those tests. [...] We do recommend that you exclude vaccinated individuals from your clinical studies for serology for SARS-CoV-2. For negative samples to establish the negative predictive -- or negative percent agreement, or specificity, we recommend that you take advantage of bank samples that were collected prior to the pandemic.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Sample size recommendations, Vaccinated vs. unvaccinated subjects, Serology study recommendations
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 3-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does FDA have specific recommendations for the distribution of positive and negative samples when including both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends excluding vaccinated individuals from serology studies for SARS-CoV-2. For negative samples, use banked pre-pandemic samples if available, or collect fresh samples.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does FDA have specific recommendations for the distribution of positive and negative samples when including both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Our recommendations are recommendations, not requirements. And if you want to move away from what we recommend, we do encourage you to check with us first, the pre-EUA process. However, the sample size of 30 positives and 75 negative are pretty much the bare minimum. We approached EUAs relatively early in the EUA process.

I know that there are, unfortunately, a lot of samples available now. And in the past, we moved to actual clinical samples. So those sizes are set based on statistics and being able to, at least at a bare minimum under the EUA authority, establish performance estimates for those tests. And so back to the original question is, because there are many people vaccinated, what do you do? Well, unfortunately, there's many people who are not vaccinated. So we do recommend that you exclude vaccinated individuals from your clinical studies for serology for SARS-CoV-2. For negative samples to establish the negative predictive -- or negative percent agreement, or specificity, we recommend that you take advantage of bank samples that were collected prior to the pandemic. I'm sure there's been a huge demand on those samples over time. So I'm not sure how readily those are yet available, but you can collect fresh samples now.

VERBATIM QUESTION: What steps should be taken if a developer wants to diverge from FDA recommendations for sample size or study design?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So our recommendations are recommendations, not requirements. And if you want to move away from what we recommend, we do encourage you to check with us first, the pre-EUA process.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: FDA recommendations, sample size, pre-EUA process
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 3-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Why did the FDA shift historical sample size requirements for EUA submissions during the pandemic?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA reduced the sample size requirement to 30 positives and 30 negatives during the pandemic because samples were initially unavailable. This change facilitated the EUA process while ensuring that performance estimates could still be established.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Why did the FDA shift historical sample size requirements for EUA submissions during the pandemic?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We approached EUAs relatively early in the EUA process. That's why we moved, for example, for diagnostic assays, for prior pandemics, we often asked for 50 positives and 50 negatives per EUAs. And we moved relatively quickly to 30 positives and 30 negatives, since samples were not available. And we allowed contrived samples.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Should currently authorized SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests be used to assess immunity or protection against COVID-19, especially after vaccination?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA currently advises against using SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests to assess immunity or protection from COVID-19, including after vaccination. Longitudinal studies are ongoing, but sufficient data to support such use is not yet available.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Should currently authorized SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests be used to assess immunity or protection against COVID-19, especially after vaccination?
VERBATIM ANSWER: As has been communicated by the FDA and other agencies, the results of the currently authorized SARS-CoV-2 antibody test should not be used to evaluate a person's level of immunity or protection from COVID at this time, especially with regard to COVID-19 vaccination. There are many ongoing longitudinal studies looking at outcomes investigating whether we can use SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests in the future as an indicator of protection. But we do not yet have that data available in order to make that decision. And we look forward to seeing the results of those studies. Those studies are not under the control of the FDA. So this remains a topic of continued discussion. As new information becomes available, we, the FDA, will, of course, consider the scientific evidence to inform our recommendations to support such claims.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests, Immunity assessment, FDA recommendations
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 3-7
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the rationale for excluding vaccinated individuals from clinical studies for SARS-CoV-2 serology tests?

SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Negative sample sourcing, Pre-pandemic samples, EUA guidance
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 3-10
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How should ongoing or future longitudinal studies on SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests be accounted for in developing new diagnostics?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA cannot yet use SARS-CoV-2 antibody test results to determine immunity or protection levels. Ongoing longitudinal studies aim to investigate future potential use for this purpose, but these studies are not FDA-controlled. The FDA will consider new evidence as it becomes available.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How should ongoing or future longitudinal studies on SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests be accounted for in developing new diagnostics?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Just a bit of a preamble to responding to this question in a little bit more detail, as has been communicated by the FDA and other agencies, the results of the currently authorized SARS-CoV-2 antibody test should not be used to evaluate a person's level of immunity or protection from COVID at this time, especially with regard to COVID-19 vaccination.

#### 4. FDA Plans for Transitioning COVID-19 Test EUAs

QA Block 4-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the FDA plan to end the EUA pathway for any SARS-CoV-2 related test diagnostics, serology, etc., prior to the official end of the public health emergency?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA does not plan to end the EUA pathway for SARS-CoV-2 tests before the public health emergency ends. The FDA is working on a transition plan for devices offered under EUA and encourages full authorization submissions. Revoked EUAs remain valid until the public health emergency is officially terminated.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA plan to end the EUA pathway for any SARS-CoV-2 related test diagnostics, serology, etc., prior to the official end of the public health emergency?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The short answer is no. If so, what would be the criteria for ending the EUA pathway? The FDA is actually not the one that would declare an end to the emergency. That's the brief answer. I'll go into a longer answer here shortly. Also, would tests previously granted EUA be allowed to remain on market if the EUA pathway is ended? And the answer is there is a short answer, is yes. Let me go into more detail on this. We have covered this before on this call, but we'll go over it again. While we can't comment on the timeline, we're working on a transition plan for devices offered under EUA. But we still are encouraging full authorization submissions to the FDA soon as you want. We are accepting Q-Subs, Pre-Subs for those. And we're accepting full authorization applications. For molecular, that mostly would be 510k submissions now, since we've already granted one submission. And then for serology and antigen, it would be-- the first one would be a de novo application. And then subsequent to that, most of the antigen and serology tests would be 510k submission. So the transition plan guidance is on the Center's, CDRH's FY '21 priority list. And additionally, revoked EUAs are in effect until the public health emergency is terminated. This does not typically happen for quite a while, and as can be seen from previous public health emergencies that still have not been terminated, like Zika and Ebola. So there are still non SARS-CoV-2 tests that are able to be sold and used under EUA authorities. We cannot anticipate when the public health emergency will end. However, the FDA is committed to helping ensure the public has access to a wide variety of test options for COVID. And we'll continue to review the EUAs to address public health needs.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: For an OTC antigen test with smartphone app interpretation running on both iOS and Android, are 30 positives needed per operating system in the clinical evaluation or just 30 positives total?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: For an OTC antigen test with a smartphone app, 30 positives and 30 negatives are not required per operating system if the IFUs are identical. Developers must conduct software validation to ensure equivalent performance across systems and validate on smartphones meeting minimum hardware specifications.
VERBATIM QUESTION: For an OTC antigen test with smartphone app interpretation running on both iOS and Android, are 30 positives needed per operating system in the clinical evaluation or just 30 positives total?
VERBATIM ANSWER: No. As long as the IFUs are identical, you would not need to test 30 positives and 30 negatives for each operating system in the clinical study. But we would expect that you conduct appropriate software validations to ensure that performance is equivalent across systems. And specifically from the template, quote, "a summary of the verification and validation performed on your software/application. To validate use of your application with a smartphone, you should develop a set of minimum smartphone specifications. That is, memory, processor capability, minimum operating system requirements, et cetera. You should validate the software on smartphones with each OS that meets those minimum hardware specifications." If you need new -- if you add new labeling via an app, you should submit that supplement with the revised labeling for FDA review. And this validation across platforms, not on a clinical study, but to ensure, on samples at the developer's site, that you get equivalent performance depending on the operating system is important. Because we have clearly seen that even within different models within a given brand using the same operating system, you can see a variability in results. And when you make your application, you can also request in a pre-EUA more details from our software review team.

Clinical testing across operating systems is not required if the IFUs are identical.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Should appropriate software validations be conducted to ensure equivalent performance of an app across both iOS and Android operating systems?
VERBATIM ANSWER: No. As long as the IFUs are identical, you would not need to test 30 positives and 30 negatives for each operating system in the clinical study. But we would expect that you conduct appropriate software validations to ensure that performance is equivalent across systems. And specifically from the template, quote, "a summary of the verification and validation performed on your software/application. To validate use of your application with a smartphone, you should develop a set of minimum smartphone specifications. That is, memory, processor capability, minimum operating system requirements, et cetera. You should validate the software on smartphones with each OS that meets those minimum hardware specifications." If you need new -- if you add new labeling via an app, you should submit that supplement with the revised labeling for FDA review. And this validation across platforms, not on a clinical study, but to ensure, on samples at the developer's site, that you get equivalent performance depending on the operating system is important. Because we have clearly seen that even within different models within a given brand using the same operating system, you can see a variability in results.

#### 11. FDA Guidance on EUA to 510k Transitions

QA Block 11-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is it correct that only the acceptable asymptomatic serial study data is required to support the asymptomatic claim for the 510k transition?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA will aim to incorporate EUA data for 510k transitions if the device remains unchanged and compliant with performance. Minimum sample requirements must follow FDA recommendations, and the size of the asymptomatic study may determine its suitability for full authorization.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is it correct that only the acceptable asymptomatic serial study data is required to support the asymptomatic claim for the 510k transition?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So currently, the serial testing program is only applicable to EUA tests. However, we will want to incorporate as much of the EUA data as is possible. And that's possible if the device does not change in any material way that can impact performance. So but as far as the minimum recommendations for the number of samples, et cetera, you'll want to validate that according to FDA recommendations. And you can go ahead and submit a Pre-Sub or a Q-Sub with your proposed studies on specific questions. So depending on the size of that asymptomatic study, it may or may not meet the expectations for full authorization.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA emphasizes the need to eliminate bias in such a study and advises consulting FDA review staff through a pre-EUA process to finalize the study plan. The FDA suggests considering an expert observer and ensuring minimal time gap between visual and app readings.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Would FDA consider an EUA application for both user-interpreted and app-interpreted indications if the study is executed where users first interpret the results themselves and then use a smartphone app to interpret the results without user input?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So we want to eliminate bias in these studies. So there might be a way to do that. We want to be as flexible as possible. But it might require an expert observer to make sure that they're not doing things out of order and changing their response. And then also there's the timing of the read. Presumably, it wouldn't be -- it would be less than a minute between the visual read and the app read. But we wouldn't want that window to be too long, because it could change the results. So that's the sort of details, probably your best hash out through interchange with FDA review staff through a pre-EUA. So just submit your study plan. I would recommend that you try to eliminate any bias, as I just mentioned one obvious potential bias, which is going to be hard to do if you don't have an observer making sure that the person performing the test doesn't cheat and go with the app reading for their visual read.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can FDA comment on the submission of an OTC EUA without an app validation completed and if it has any impact on the EUA's review priority?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA confirms that submitting an OTC EUA without app validation completed does not affect the submission's review priority or initial authorization. Developers are not required to integrate a reporting or reading app, though a postmarket commitment to develop reporting capabilities is needed.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can FDA comment on the submission of an OTC EUA without an app validation completed and if it has any impact on the EUA's review priority?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So the short answer is no. It will have no impact on the original submission and our ability to authorize that. We've done that already from such tests. But we do add in a postmarket commitment to develop such a reporting app. A reading app would not be required at all. And developers can choose to use a reading app or not. It's not even recommended that necessarily the developer uses a reading app. But if you think the test will perform better with the reading app, or it'll be easier for patients to use, and easier to capture the data, and transmit data, et cetera, et cetera, yeah, you're free to do that. But again, no. You do not need a reader or reporter app at the time of initial authorization. And then we don't even require a reporting app. We just want a postmarket commitment that at postmarket, you'll have a method of patients being able to report their results for their clinicians and as well as for public health surveillance needs.

QA Block 15-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How can bias in studies involving both manual user interpretation and app readings of test results be minimized?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: To minimize bias, consider having an expert observer ensure proper testing order and timing between manual and app readings. The time window should be short to avoid result changes. FDA recommends addressing these details in a pre-EUA study plan submission.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How can bias in studies involving both manual user interpretation and app readings of test results be minimized?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So that could potentially bias the manual read. Because if they said negative, but the app says positive, the reader may switch their answer on the manual. So we want to eliminate bias in these studies. So there might be a way to do that. We want to be as flexible as possible. But it might require an expert observer to make sure that they're not doing things out of order and changing their response. And then also there's the timing of the read. Presumably, it wouldn't be -- it would be less than a minute between the visual read and the app read. But we wouldn't want that window to be too long, because it could change the results.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are there specific requirements regarding the timing between manual visual reads and app-based readings during study validation?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The timing between the visual read and the app-based read should ideally be less than a minute to avoid result changes. FDA recommends addressing specific timing details through discussions with review staff via a pre-EUA.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are there specific requirements regarding the timing between manual visual reads and app-based readings during study validation?
VERBATIM ANSWER: And then also there's the timing of the read. Presumably, it wouldn't be -- it would be less than a minute between the visual read and the app read. But we wouldn't want that window to be too long, because it could change the results. So that's the sort of details, probably your best hash out through interchange with FDA review staff through a pre-EUA.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What postmarket commitments are required if a reporting app is not used at the time of EUA authorization?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA requires a postmarket commitment to ensure patients can report results for clinicians and public health surveillance if a reporting app is not used at EUA authorization.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What postmarket commitments are required if a reporting app is not used at the time of EUA authorization?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah. So the short answer is no. It will have no impact on the original submission and our ability to authorize that. We've done that already from such tests. But we do add in a postmarket commitment to develop such a reporting app. A reading app would not be required at all. And developers can choose to use a reading app or not. It's not even recommended that necessarily the developer uses a reading app. But if you think the test will perform better with the reading app, or it'll be easier for patients to use, and easier to capture the data, and transmit data, et cetera, et cetera, yeah, you're free to do that. But again, no. You do not need a reader or reporter app at the time of initial authorization.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA does not plan immediate changes for transitioning from EUA to full 820. FDA is reviewing submissions for full authorization, recommending guidance updates via templates. Long-term market participants are encouraged to begin full authorization processes. Transition guidance will outline general timelines and expectations but not specific conversion recommendations for IVDs.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If we are transitioning from EUA with some parts waived out in 820 to full 820, will there be another plan for this transition or will it be addressed as it comes, specifically regarding transitioning to ISO?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So I don't I don't see any immediate change to how we have EUA and how we have full authorization in the near future. We are accepting Q-Subs and Pre-Subs for full authorization. We are reviewing those. We are getting back to folks as soon as possible. And all our areas antigen, molecular, and serology have ideas. Of course, molecular, we've already done it. So we have very clear recommendations. We are going to work on templates, updates on what those full authorization recommendations are.
