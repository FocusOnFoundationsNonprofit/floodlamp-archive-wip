#### 1. FDA Updates on COVID-19 Testing Guidelines

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the key validation recommendations for direct antigen tests based on the FDA's recent update?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends an 80% sensitivity minimum for antigen tests compared to high-sensitivity molecular assays and high specificity to ensure reliability of positive results. Negative results may require reflex testing with molecular tests in certain situations.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the key validation recommendations for direct antigen tests based on the FDA's recent update?
VERBATIM ANSWER: For the direct antigen test, we've outlined the recommendations for validation for those tests. Of course we authorized the first one last week on Friday. We have minimum performance expectation of 80% sensitivity relative to a high sensitivity molecular asset and we also are recommending that the specificity be very high so that a positive result can be relied upon. Of course with lower sensitivity tests for the virus, there is the concern that there may be false negatives. So we do have language in the authorization dealing with what to do with a false - with a negative result. And that is a reflex from a direct antigen negative result to a molecular result to be considered for depending on situations.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Validation criteria for direct antigen tests, Sensitivity and specificity, Reflex testing for false negatives
REVIEW FLAG: False

VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the implications of shifting from contrived samples to actual patient samples for clinical performance testing in molecular diagnostics?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The main updates for molecular have to do with the fact that now there are positive patient samples. We are shifting from the use of contrived samples to supplement applications to the recommendation that actual patient samples are used for the clinical performance testing. And as a result -- for molecular tests -- there will also be comparisons to the recommendation as to make a comparison to previously authorized molecular tests in order to access whether an accurate performance has been established.

#### 4. Prospective Clinical Evaluation for Serology Finger Stick Samples

QA Block 4-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is it acceptable to compare finger stick serology results to previously obtained RT-PCR results for an evaluation of finger stick samples for serology clinical evaluation?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA prefers comparing finger stick serology results to another blood sample (whole blood, serum, or plasma) rather than to previously obtained RT-PCR results, as performance correlation may vary over time and depend on antibody development. If pursuing an alternate approach, consultation with the FDA's review team is recommended.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is it acceptable to compare finger stick serology results to previously obtained RT-PCR results for an evaluation of finger stick samples for serology clinical evaluation?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, I would want to refer to the template on this. We would prefer that you do a comparison to another blood sample - either whole blood, serum or plasma -- rather than to a previous molecular result. If you want to pursue a different pathway for that, I would have a conversation with our team about that. And you can either -- if you have a primary reviewer already -- you can discuss that with a primary reviewer or if you want to just email us a template. I would say that there is a little bit of a risk using a previous molecular result and performance may not be exactly correlated depending on how long ago that patient turned positive, how long ago that patient developed antibody or had symptoms and also about particular antibodies that have been raised and FDA Webinar still in the early stage or they've been - so depending on what your serology test are. So, you know, any sort of thoughts about, you know, following a different pathway I would just recommend that you discuss it with our staff.

#### 5. Swab Selection and Testing Strategies for Asymptomatic Patients

QA Block 5-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What governs the use of an NP swab versus an NS swab and how does that correlate to testing asymptomatic patients?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA considers NP swabs as potentially better, but other swabs like nasal anterior nasal, pharyngeal swab, and saliva are authorized. Best swab choice for asymptomatic patients is not yet established and depends on viral titers. EUA authorized tests are fine for asymptomatic testing, and any swab type may be used due to lack of conclusive data and practical supply considerations.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What governs the use of an NP swab versus an NS swab and how does that correlate to testing asymptomatic patients?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We still feel that NP swab is probably is the better swab. But obviously we've authorized other swabs - nasal anterior nasal swab or a pharyngeal swab, mouth saliva and sputum and BAL. So and as far as what is best to use for asymptomatic patients, I would say that that is an area that hasn't been established yet. It's going to really depend on the vital titers that are present in asymptomatic patient. We have a number of developers who are interested in pursuing an opportunity to put into their intended use, the inclusion of testing in asymptomatic patients, and their working with our team about appropriate study design. We have written the intended use statements for at least a molecular essay authorization to allow for the testing of - in asymptomatic patients with a physician clinician order. So we don't see any issues with using a EUA FDA Webinar authorized test for testing of asymptomatic individuals. And we have not specified a swab type to use. And that's simply because we don't have strong signs yet and there's also the practical consideration that there' are sometimes limited supplies of nasopharyngeal swabs. And if you are testing an asymptomatic population and perhaps you're doing consecutive testing or successive testing where you're testing those individuals on a regular basis, excellent compliance may be achieved using say swabbing both anterior nares rather than doing NPswabs. So we do want to give discretion to the providers who are performing this specimen collection in testing.

QA Block 5-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What information can you share about testing strategies going forward for asymptomatic patients?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA continues to prefer nasopharyngeal swabs but has authorized other types, including nasal, anterior nasal, pharyngeal, mouth saliva, sputum, and BAL. There isn't established data on the best swab for asymptomatic patients, as it depends on viral titers. Developers are exploring testing for asymptomatic patients and working with the FDA on study designs. EUA-authorized tests can be used for asymptomatic individuals with clinician orders, and swab types aren't restricted due to limited data and supply issues. Providers have discretion in choosing swabs, especially for regular testing.

#### 8. Expedited EUA Pathways for Serology Testing Explained

QA Block 8-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What studies might be waived if the FDA evaluation is performed under the umbrella EUA pathway versus the regular EUA pathway for serology?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Under the umbrella EUA pathway, studies related to cross-reactivity and additional clinical performance data are waived if specificity is at least 95%.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What studies might be waived if the FDA evaluation is performed under the umbrella EUA pathway versus the regular EUA pathway for serology?
VERBATIM ANSWER: ..and that is - we size that panel to address both specificity and cross-reactivity. As long as specificity is at least 95% or greater, we wave their acquirement to do cross-reactivity testing. And that minimum of 95% specificity is required for their umbrella pathway. And then on the positive sample side, you asked that suffices also for the clinical performance. So there's no requirement for additional data on clinical performance, negative- positive samples and cross-reactivity as long as the minimum thresholds are met.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is there a difference in review time if testing has to wait for NCI results?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Testing that waits for NCI results generally follows an expedited pathway, but additional sponsor-submitted information can extend review time.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is there a difference in review time if testing has to wait for NCI results?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So yes, so there's quite an interest in the NCI testing program, and we are doing some amounts of testing. But as the interest grows, there may be the development of a backlog there. Once results are known from the NCI testing and its beneath the umbrella authorization threshold, if there is an assay that does not differentiate IgM, IgG, or other isotypes, there is an expedited pathway to authorization. If there is additional information that a sponsor would like us to review, that may add some time to the review. We look for whether the results are consistent between what data the sponsor has generated and the data generated with the NCI testing.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA has updated its guidance with recommended validation studies for saliva testing, including comparison to a previous swab type with at least 30 positive and 30 negative samples achieving 95% concordance with authorized tests. Saliva samples should not contain sputum, and home collection or testing requires its own EUA.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are there any updates or guidance on saliva testing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes so with the template update on Monday this week to our guidance including updates to molecular and the addition of the direct antigen, I don't believe the direct antigen has saliva, it may not. But at least for the molecular, we have proposed some recommended studies to do the comparison testing. FDA Webinar We recommend that you compare to a previous swab type and that minimum number of positives and negatives. I believe it's 30 and 30. And that need at least the bar threshold of 95% concordance to the previously authorized test performance. And so those recommendations are now in our templates where we have made recommendations about how to validate saliva. We think that it's important that no sputum be collected, so patients will want to be given guidance that they should not cough say or produce any sputum when they're given the slightest sample. We think that may interfere with the accuracy of the saliva sample. And then of course home collection of any sample type and as well as home testing does require its own EUA.

VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the process followed by the FDA to systematically review EUA documentation?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Sure, so it really depends a lot on what we received from the sponsor - from the developer. We do - as soon as we get in a submission, we do at least the first pass through it to see if there are any issues and work with the manufacturer to address anything that we find concerning. And then we, you know, we do more of a systematic review of the documentation that the sponsor provides. And depending on, you know, how much back and forth we need to go through with it - with the developer, that will affect the guideline. FDA Webinar And, you know, for the submissions that we've had in so far across the board - - not just for serology -- we've authorized some of the EUAs within 24 hours.

QA Block 1-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What does the FDA recommend regarding the specificity requirements for direct antigen tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends that specificity for direct antigen tests be very high to ensure reliable positive results. A negative result may require confirmation with a molecular test depending on the situation.
VERBATIM QUESTION: IMPLICIT
VERBATIM ANSWER: For the direct antigen test, we've outlined the recommendations for validation for those tests. Of course we authorized the first one last week on Friday. We have minimum performance expectation of 80% sensitivity relative to a high sensitivity molecular asset and we also are recommending that the specificity be very high so that a positive result can be relied upon. Of course with lower sensitivity tests for the virus, there is the concern that there may be false negatives. So we do have language in the authorization dealing with what to do with a false - with a negative result. And that is a reflex from a direct antigen negative result to a molecular result to be considered for depending on situations.

If you want to pursue a different pathway for that, I would have a conversation with our team about that. And you can either -- if you have a primary reviewer already -- you can discuss that with a primary reviewer or if you want to just email us a template. I would say that there is a little bit of a risk using a previous molecular result and performance may not be exactly correlated depending on how long ago that patient turned positive, how long ago that patient developed antibody or had symptoms and also about particular antibodies that have been raised and FDA Webinar still in the early stage or they've been - so depending on what your serology test are. So, you know, any sort of thoughts about, you know, following a different pathway I would just recommend that you discuss it with our staff.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: When will the new reimbursement figures for antibody or serology testing come out?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA states that coverage and reimbursement decisions are under CMS's purview. CMS has released guidance with some relevant figures, and you are advised to contact CMS or participate in the clinical laboratory COVID-19 response weekly calls for clarification.
VERBATIM QUESTION: When will the new reimbursement figures for antibody or serology testing come out?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So that is not in the FDA's purview as far as coverage and reimbursement and coverage amounts. That is in CMS's purview, so I would direct you to FDA Webinar them. Toby Lowe, is there any helpful hints we can give in how they approach CMS about that question? I know that CMS recently put out guidance about testing and that's where they did include some of those numbers. I believe there is contact information on that document, so I recommend reaching out to that group. I will also mention that there is a clinical laboratory COVID-19 response weekly call that happens on Monday afternoons where CDC, CMS and FDA often participate. So if you look at CDC's website, you can see dial-in information where there's often issues like this that fall under shared responsibility amongst the agencies. Questions like this are often discussed.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Is there a process for importing commercially manufactured and validated serology test kits for distribution while an EUA is pending?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, so if you look through our policy document, the guidance document, commercially manufactured serology tests may be marketed while they are pursuing an EUA. So we would ask that notification be sent to FDA for the process in the guidance document and indicating that it's validated and including all the information noted in the guidance. And then within 10 days, submit an EUA request. And during that time, they - those tests are able to be imported.
