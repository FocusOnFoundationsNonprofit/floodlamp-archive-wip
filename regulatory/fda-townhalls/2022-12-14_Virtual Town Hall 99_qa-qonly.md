#### 1. Mpox and COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Updates and Guidance

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can FDA clarify what credible reports are appropriate for mutation monitoring in mpox tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends using peer-reviewed literature or public health community reports, such as those from state public health laboratories, for mutation monitoring in mpox tests. Developers encountering potential issues can consider these on a case-by-case basis.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can FDA clarify what credible reports are appropriate for mutation monitoring in mpox tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We do recommend using peer reviewed literature, or in the more immediate term, using reports from public health communities, from the public health community, such as state public health laboratories. There may also be other situations where a test developer receives a signal that there may be an issue, and that's something that would be considered on a one‐off basis, since monitoring for impact of mutations is a very important aspect of maintaining test performance.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Commander Kimberly Piermatteo (FDA)
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: mpox test mutation monitoring, credible reports for mutation detection
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What does a reduction of clinical performance by 5% or more mean in the context of mutations affecting mpox test performance?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: A reduction of clinical performance by 5% or more refers to either a 5% or greater drop in clinical sensitivity from the originally authorized test performance or a drop below the minimum clinical performance levels recommended by FDA in the EUA templates.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What does a reduction of clinical performance by 5% or more mean in the context of mutations affecting mpox test performance?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We consider a reduction in clinical sensitivity of 5% or more from the previously established performance, which is the performance reflected in the authorized documents for authorized tests, or a decrease in the test performance to a level below the performance recommendations in the applicable EUA templates.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Commander Kimberly Piermatteo (FDA)
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)

REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How are data generated from current viral sequences, through in silico or wet testing with contrived samples, correlated to the original clinical study if clinical performance is defined by positive percent agreement?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA evaluates the risk of a test's performance decreasing by at least 5% if a mutation causing a false negative is present in over 5% of circulating viral sequences. This assessment is based on clinical performance data from the original study.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How are data generated from current viral sequences, through in silico or wet testing with contrived samples, correlated to the original clinical study if clinical performance is defined by positive percent agreement?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So if a test is expected to fail due to a mutation, and by fail we mean return a false negative, fail to detect the virus, and that mutation that would cause that failure is in more than 5% of currently circulating virus sequences, then we consider the test to be at risk of exhibiting a performance decrease of at least 5% of the performance in the EUA labeling, where which is the performance that was generated using clinical samples without that problematic mutation.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Commander Kimberly Piermatteo (FDA)
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)

#### 2. Clarifying Humidity Requirements for COVID-19 Test Stability Studies

QA Block 2-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can the FDA clarify if high humidity is required for the duration of the real-time reagent stability study?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: High humidity is not required for the duration of the real-time reagent stability study. It can be assessed in a seven-day flex study designed to evaluate the robustness of the assay under extreme conditions.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can the FDA clarify if high humidity is required for the duration of the real-time reagent stability study?
VERBATIM ANSWER: No, the high humidity condition is not required for the duration of the real time reagent stability study. High humidity at 30 degrees Celsius can be evaluated in a flex study that can be performed across seven days. Flex studies typically are used to assess the robustness of an assay through appropriately designed studies to challenge the operational limits of the test system, by simulating conditions of use outside of the intended use environment. That may include potential use errors, and anticipated environmental stresses, such as temperature and humidity extremes. Flex studies should be conducted to the point of failure to determine the maximum deviation that will allow for generating accurate results. And if your device is intended for distribution into high humidity climate zones, under conditions that can't easily maintain the recommended storage conditions, then it is important to ensure that your product maintains shelf life under those conditions. So that is one situation where you would want to consider a flex study like this.
