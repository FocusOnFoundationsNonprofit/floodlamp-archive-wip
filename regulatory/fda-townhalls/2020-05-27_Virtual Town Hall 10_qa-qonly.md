#### 8. EUA Requirements for Virus Transport and Saliva Collection

QA Block 8-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the views on the comparison between saliva sample collection and other methods for symptomatic, asymptomatic, or pre-symptomatic individuals?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA updated the template with recommendations for saliva validation. Manufacturers can notify the FDA, submit validation, and enter the market while under review. Labs are not required to submit for an EUA for saliva when collected by healthcare workers but must follow the template's recommendations. For home collection, EUA authorization is required for both labs and kit manufacturers.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the views on the comparison between saliva sample collection and other methods for symptomatic, asymptomatic, or pre-symptomatic individuals?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. I'm going to refer you to our template for molecular and/or direct antigens. We have updated the template with recommendations for saliva validation. If you're a manufacturer, you can notify us of an update, submit your validation and then be on the market while we review your submission. If you're a lab, you're not required to submit a EUA or saliva. Both of these are in circumstances where saliva is collected by a healthcare worker. If you're a lab, we have recommendations for saliva validation on our template. You can follow that. You're not required to submit an EUA. If you want to offer this for home collection, we do require an EUA authorization prior to offering that whether you are a lab or whether you are a kit manufacturer.

REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 8-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: If we only handle the saliva collection part for home collection kits, do we need to partner with a lab for processing and establish the full chain of custody before submitting for an EUA authorization?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA requires home collection kit developers to partner with at least one EUA-authorized test or one that can be authorized in parallel. EUA authorization for the kit is granted in concert with a specific assay.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If we only handle the saliva collection part for home collection kits, do we need to partner with a lab for processing and establish the full chain of custody before submitting for an EUA authorization?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So we do only authorize when an EUA authorized test is also authorized for use for that collection kit. And then each new assay will require a validation study to be added for that collection kit to be added to their authorization. So at a FDA Townhall minimum, developers of home collection kits do need to link up with at least one assay that's already EUA authorized or can be EUA authorized in parallel. And then we can give an EUA authorization to a home collection kit in concert with a specific assay.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: If saliva samples are collected by healthcare workers, are there specific validation recommendations for labs or manufacturers even if an EUA is not required?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA states that labs are not required to submit an EUA for saliva samples collected by healthcare workers, but they should follow the saliva validation recommendations in the agency's template. Manufacturers can notify FDA of an update, submit validation data, and enter the market while their submission is under review.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If saliva samples are collected by healthcare workers, are there specific validation recommendations for labs or manufacturers even if an EUA is not required?
VERBATIM ANSWER: ...you can notify us of an update, submit your validation and then be on the market while we review your submission. If you're a lab, you're not required to submit a EUA or saliva.

QA Block 8-9
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the steps for linking a home collection kit to an EUA-authorized assay, and how should validation studies be conducted?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA requires that a home collection kit be linked with at least one EUA-authorized assay or one that can gain EUA authorization in parallel. Each new assay requires a validation study for the kit to gain authorization. EUA authorizations are issued for the kit and assay together.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the steps for linking a home collection kit to an EUA-authorized assay, and how should validation studies be conducted?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So we do only authorize when an EUA authorized test is also authorized for use for that collection kit. And then each new assay will require a validation study to be added for that collection kit to be added to their authorization. So at a FDA Townhall minimum, developers of home collection kits do need to link up with at least one assay that's already EUA authorized or can be EUA authorized in parallel. And then we can give an EUA authorization to a home collection kit in concert with a specific assay.

#### 9. Evaluating CT Values for Clinical Decision-Making in Labs

QA Block 9-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are your views on labs reporting CT values from PCR tests for clinical decisions?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA acknowledges the interest in using CT values for clinical decisions but highlights challenges, including variability in respiratory sample collection and unclear clinical validity in comparison to blood-based viral load tests. They support labs making decisions based on their expertise.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are your views on labs reporting CT values from PCR tests for clinical decisions?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. Certainly, I've heard about this from others. So I think the context -- and FDA Townhall correct me if I'm wrong -- is that sometimes even when symptoms dissipate for patients, that they can stay in molecular test positive. And clinicians are trying to make decisions during these situations and are hoping that a very high CT which is a very low viral amount -- at least in that particular sample collection -- might help them determine what to do with that patient. So I would say that you know, we still don't know very much about that. And then there are, you know, very clear challenges when collecting a respiratory specimen of any type. As to whether that sample stays equally well as the next time we sample even the same patient in some uniform way. So what can you really say about what the viral level is with one test used in this manner very unlike other viral load tests like for, you know, HIV, COV, HPV and others that use a blood-based test system where obviously there's great clinical validity in those tests and those patients. So I understand your concern. It's really challenging to think about how you might validate for that situation. So you know, I think you're an expert. You know your technology and the test that you're using at your lab. And I would certainly support you being comfortable what you do or don't do with the information you have at hand.

VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, we wouldn't make that statement. It's my understanding that the CE mark for this kind of test is a self-certification and not by an agency or a notified body or other third-party. So you know, it's not something that for CE mark for the contest would be reviewed prior to making those kits commercially available. So you know, our FDA would not. However, I will say that where there is a review -- a country of origin review -- any other countries that do review these and make horrible decisions we do incorporate those decisions into our review thinking for a given test what it has achieved so.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Why is the FDA waiving the GMP requirement and quality system requirements in all the EUA approvals?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA does not waive all GMP and quality system requirements under EUA approvals. Key elements like complaint handling and MDR reporting are still required for safety. Some flexibility is allowed to meet urgent public health needs during emergencies.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Why is the FDA waiving the GMP requirement and quality system requirements in all the EUA approvals?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So under the emergency declaration situation, in order to make as many tests and other devices available, we do make efficient use. We do not waive all requirements. And Toby can fill in the details. But we still do require some important elements such as complaint handling and MDR reporting that we believe is an important safety element to keep. And there are other provisions that we have or will have made requirements for that are above what we usually consider in an emergency situation. But practically speaking, if we didn't allow some flexibility when it comes to those regulations and compliance with those regulations, we wouldn't be able to address some of the significant needs in an emergency such as this.
