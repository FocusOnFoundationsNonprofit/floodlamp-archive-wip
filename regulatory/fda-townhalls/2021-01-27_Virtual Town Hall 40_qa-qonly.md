#### 1. Developing and Validating COVID-19 Tests Amid Mutations

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What steps should be taken by developers of EUA-authorized COVID-19 tests to address the potential impact of new mutations?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Developers of EUA-authorized COVID-19 tests should consider SARS-CoV-2 variants, monitor performance differences (e.g., using single vs. multiple targets), work with FDA when updates are needed, and keep mutations affecting test components like probes and primers in mind.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What steps should be taken by developers of EUA-authorized COVID-19 tests to address the potential impact of new mutations?
VERBATIM ANSWER: I wanted to give some heads up on mutations. This continues to be a very hot topic and, you know, I think it's ideal for those that already have an EUA-authorized test and those who are developing tests, to consider the variants. We move to authorizing single target assays relatively early in the pandemic with the knowledge at that time that single target assays - we had not seen mutations that would impact them. But we are starting to see mutation to impact tests and obviously single target versus multiple target - targeting multiple reasons of SARS virus and, you know, there may be a performance difference going forward. So we'll certainly stay vigilant at the FDA's side on monitoring this. But we do want to put a shout out to developers to certainly be considering this. And they - as - when they, you know, and to work with us as - in looking ahead in how we can maintain the highest performance possible, for COVID tests, for molecular tests that includes probes and primers. We're obviously open to talking to developers who want to make updates or that are in development.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: COVID-19 test mutations, EUA test updates, Test performance monitoring
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the FDA's expectations for molecular test developers regarding updates to probes and primers for continued performance in light of variants?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA encourages developers to consider variants and work with them on maintaining high performance for COVID molecular tests, including probes and primers. No changes to recommendations at this time.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the FDA's expectations for molecular test developers regarding updates to probes and primers for continued performance in light of variants?
VERBATIM ANSWER: But we do want to put a shout out to developers to certainly be considering this. And they - as - when they, you know, and to work with us as - in looking ahead in how we can maintain the highest performance possible, for COVID tests, for molecular tests that includes probes and primers. We're obviously open to talking to developers who want to make updates or that are in development, you know, about how best to do this. So no change in recommendations at this time. Just, you know, a heads up.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Molecular test updates, Variants impact, FDA guidance
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the FDA have any recommendations for developers of antigen and serology tests to account for mutations affecting the spike protein?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA currently has no changes in recommendations for antigen and serology test developers but advises them to consider virus variants, particularly mutations in the spike protein, which may impact test performance.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA have any recommendations for developers of antigen and serology tests to account for mutations affecting the spike protein?
VERBATIM ANSWER: No change in recommendations at this time. Just, you know, a heads up. We think that antigen developers and serology developers should keep these variants in mind as well. You know, numerous of the serology tests do target the spike protein which can alter and at least one of the antigen tests does target spike protein. But of course, there can be a mutation that could affect other genes, other targets within the virus.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Spike protein mutations, Antigen tests, Serology tests
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are there specific processes developers should follow when proposing updates to existing EUAs for COVID-19 tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is open to discussions with developers on how to update EUA-authorized COVID-19 tests or those in development, to ensure high performance.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are there specific processes developers should follow when proposing updates to existing EUAs for COVID-19 tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We're obviously open to talking to developers who want to make updates or that are in development, you know, about how best to do this.

#### 2. Sensitivity Standards for COVID Breath Test Screening

QA Block 2-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the required sensitivity for breath screening tests for COVID-19 and respiratory viral infections?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is working to define sensitivity targets for breath screening tests for COVID-19 and aims to finalize recommendations soon. Novel technologies like breath tests need rigorous validation, possibly exceeding standard sample requirements. High sensitivity and specificity relative to molecular tests are crucial considerations. Updates for developers are expected soon.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the required sensitivity for breath screening tests for COVID-19 and respiratory viral infections?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So this is an important question and in fact, our team - I've charged our team with coming up with targets for this. They promised me today and - but probably by the end of the day, and…So, you know, you could imagine - and I'll just, you know, talk a little bit philosophy on a nonstandard sort of test. First of all, we're very open to novel tests. We have no idea if breath tests, you know, truly can perform, but we're totally open to it. We do want to have them validated appropriately and since they're a newer technology we're likely to ask for more than sort of the standard technology samples. So I don't know if they gave you sample numbers yet. But we're working on them as well. You could imagine that the breath test might be used for either diagnostic purposes and/or asymptomatic screening, surveillance. You know, the FDA data for this pandemic we don't intend to regulate for surveillance. So the other thing about breath tests because there may be other breath test developers out there, is that we are concerned with potential carryover from one patient to the next. So that will be an important consideration of the safety and may not be in the recommendations yet. But I think there's going to be challenges with whether a developer wants to pursue, you know, symptomatic claims or asymptomatic claims. You know, some - there is some thought. Just to be open that, you know, we don't know if symptomatic or asymptomatic claims are necessarily the best claim to go to first, because some of the symptoms, you know, ideally might need a, you know, a test that has a longer proven track record. On the other hand, we have a huge need to expand testing into the asymptomatic in screening population. And so that might be the more ideal population. I - there's no, you know, we're open to all comers here. So if you want to come in and you want to pursue symptomatic claims, we'll look into what that looks like. But I do see the sweet spot potentially for the technology - if it can perform, in the asymptomatic population. And that it could really address some of our needs to really increase the - not only the amount of testing but the frequency so that everybody can get tested at will. So we'll want to look at in that population - in whatever population, we'll want to look at, you know, what is the sensitivity or PPA relative to a molecular test. High sensitivity in molecular test and also the specificity and/or NPA. So does it call any false positives? Now, you know, it could be that for benefit risk calculations we may, you know, decide that positives should be, you know, double checked with the molecular tests and so that is some of the thinking that we're looking at right now. However, if the NPA is - I mean if the PPA and NPV, negative predictive value, is extremely high for say people in the asymptomatic population, that could be - that could really be a win. And so I'm just thinking through all the calculations right now. So I think we're going to ask for more positives and more negatives than we typically had. And we're working with our statistician on determining what that - what our recommendations are going to be there. So stay tuned.

QA Block 2-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are breath test developers required to validate against standard technology samples or provide additional validation due to the novel nature of the technology?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is likely to require additional validation for breath tests beyond standard technology samples due to their novel nature.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are breath test developers required to validate against standard technology samples or provide additional validation due to the novel nature of the technology?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We do want to have them validated appropriately and since they're a newer technology we're likely to ask for more than sort of the standard technology samples.

QA Block 2-6
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How should developers prioritize or approach claims for symptomatic versus asymptomatic populations for breath test usage?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA is open to developers pursuing either symptomatic or asymptomatic claims for breath tests, but there may be challenges with both. While symptomatic claims may require a longer track record of test validation, the asymptomatic population shows significant potential due to the need for expanded and frequent testing. FDA sees promise in targeting the asymptomatic population if the tests perform well.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How should developers prioritize or approach claims for symptomatic versus asymptomatic populations for breath test usage?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. Yes. So this is an important question and in fact, our team - I've charged our team with coming up with targets for this. They promised me today and - but probably by the end of the day, and… But we haven't received any feedback yet though. So, you know, you could imagine - and I'll just, you know, talk a little bit philosophy on a nonstandard sort of test. First of all, we're very open to novel tests.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the FDA's expectations for sensitivity (PPA) and specificity (NPA) of breath tests in comparison to molecular tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA is open to novel breath tests and seeks validation against molecular tests. Preliminary expectations include considering usage scenarios like diagnostic or asymptomatic screening, potential carryover between patients, and alignment with molecular test sensitivity (PPA) and specificity (NPA). Developers may need to exceed standard technology sample counts, and updates to recommendations are forthcoming.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the FDA's expectations for sensitivity (PPA) and specificity (NPA) of breath tests in comparison to molecular tests?

CLARIFIED QUESTION: For asymptomatic population testing, what is the FDA's benefit-risk calculation approach for interpreting results from breath tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is open to validating novel tests like breath tests for asymptomatic screening but wants them compared against molecular tests in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Outcomes like high sensitivity (PPA) and high negative predictive value (NPV) are key. Positives may need confirmation with molecular testing, and calculations are being worked on to guide recommendations.

#### 3. Updating EUA Molecular Tests for Mutations and Accuracy

QA Block 3-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the process if a developer of an EUA-authorized molecular test wants to change the primer and probes, either in response to a mutation or proactively to make the test more resistant to mutations by adding a second target?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA advises that a change to primers and probes may require a supplement, depending on actions with the original test. Developers must ensure accuracy, no sensitivity loss, and sufficient data (e.g., 30 positives/negatives, LOD, cross-reactivity, inclusivity) if adding a target.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the process if a developer of an EUA-authorized molecular test wants to change the primer and probes, either in response to a mutation or proactively to make the test more resistant to mutations by adding a second target?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So it would be potentially a supplement. It kind of depends on what you're going to do with the original test. You know, if you're going to take it off the market when you have a new authorization then there may not need to be a separate authorization. We're going to want to look at how the changes affect your accuracy. So and you can imagine different ways to account for a mutation. You could use degenerate primers and probes and we would just want to make sure that, you know, however you design those doesn't decrease the sensitivity of the overall reaction. There might, you know, there are different ways to go about that. And then if you are adding a new target, we want - we do want to make sure that that target is going to be accurate. We know the level of that accuracy. And so that would be, you know, pretty much all the key elements of development which would be, you know, if it's just for symptomatic claims then, you know, 30 positives, 30 negatives in LOD. And the - in the cross-reactivity and inclusivity testing that we ask for.

#### 6. Guidance on Randomization for Nasal Swab Collections

QA Block 6-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the FDA's guidance on the order of nasal swab sample collection for at-home antigen tests and reference PCR devices?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends randomizing the order of collections while avoiding bias. Typically, the layperson's self-collection should go first to prevent inadvertent training by the healthcare professional. To mitigate issues like reduced viral load, a delay of 15 minutes to an hour between collections is advisable. Alternatively, dual swabs with randomization can be performed. Further guidance should be sought from FDA reviewers.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the FDA's guidance on the order of nasal swab sample collection for at-home antigen tests and reference PCR devices?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, you do want to randomize. Okay? But you also want to make sure that the candidate device isn't at a disadvantage here. Then, the typical approach we suggest is layperson collection should go first so that the trained user isn't inadvertently training the layperson on specimen collection. However, this creates challenges like leaving less virus in anterior nares for the comparator test. The best solution is to include a delay period between collections, typically 15 minutes to an hour, to restore conditions in the nares. Alternatively, simultaneous dual swabs in both nostrils can be randomized if this ensures no bias and the comparator's design requires a professional user. Further specifics should be discussed with FDA review staff or submitted via the Templates email box.

REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 6-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the FDA expect the self-collection for the test device to occur first, followed by the healthcare professional collecting the swab for the reference PCR test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA typically suggests that layperson collection should occur first to avoid influencing the layperson's technique through observation of the professional collection. However, this may cause bias if the initial self-collection depletes material for the comparator. A recommended approach is to introduce a waiting period (15 minutes to 1 hour) between self-collection and professional collection.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA expect the self-collection for the test device to occur first, followed by the healthcare professional collecting the swab for the reference PCR test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: I think we typically ask for the layperson collection to go first so that the, you know, the trained user isn't inevitably training the layperson on specimen collection. The challenge with that is the patient collects the swab first in both anterior nares, which is typically the procedure, right? You could leave less - significantly less virus in the anterior nares for the candidate - for the comparator test. This would introduce bias there. Yes. So I've been typically thinking of having a - this be a dual self-collection procedure. But when your comparator is one that doesn't have a self-collection option that presents a challenge. Yes. You could collect after - again, after a period of time. So you could sample - the patient can sample their anterior nares first and wait a period of time. And we've - we have discussed this months ago with the RADx program and - about how they might do this. And we talked about some time periods but we didn't know what the best time period was. One would be 15 minutes I think, up to an hour. So that would be actually probably the best way to do this is to, thank you Toby, for reminding me of that previous discussion on this topic.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA does not require validation studies to use US-based samples, though it is preferred. For point-of-care devices, studies should replicate US conditions as closely as possible.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Under what conditions can non-US samples be included in the validation for an EUA application?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So we have not required for such a task that the samples be US-based. We'd like to see US-based. For point of care, I'll just say because I brought it up, it is important that the setting for point of care testing, you know, mimic the US. And it's ideal if the point of care studies can be in the US because how, you know, point of care testing is done in the US can be substantially different from other countries. And we certainly see, you know, point of care studies done in central laboratories with trained workers. So that's obviously - even though it might be a device that's amenable to point of care that's not what we're looking at. We're looking at can an untrained healthcare worker who is not a laboratorian, perform the test and get accurate results? But anyway, back to your question. Yes, we have no requirement for US samples and US testing although it's ideal.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What constitutes acceptable information about sample collection, storage, and location to avoid issues during FDA evaluation of a test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA advises capturing detailed information about samples, such as where and when they were collected and how they were stored, as this may assist in addressing unusual results and help in test evaluations, especially with the progression of variants.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What constitutes acceptable information about sample collection, storage, and location to avoid issues during FDA evaluation of a test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: That sort of thing may only come up if we see funny results and we're trying to figure out, you know, what's going on. So it's best to capture as much relevant information as you can on these samples, because we often want to know how is it - where they're collected; when were they collected; and how were they stored if they're banked? All those questions are really important. And then all the relevant important information, you know, is important as well. But, you know, I anticipate with the variants progressing, our evaluation of all the tests, is going to be more challenged. And the validation of the test might be challenged as well by variant.

VERBATIM ANSWER: But, you know, I anticipate with the variants progressing, our evaluation of all the tests, is going to be more challenged. And the validation of the test might be challenged as well by variant. So - and so…our experiences early in the pandemic may be different for serology and other tests, than they are currently or in the future.

#### 9. Developing Variant Testing Strategies for Antigen and Serology Assays

QA Block 9-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is any additional variant testing required as part of the initial EUA submission for manufacturers submitting a point-of-care nucleoprotein-based antigen test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA has not finalized requirements for additional variant testing as part of the initial EUA submission. They are exploring options like using inactivated virus for testing and will likely require monitoring for potential sensitivity loss due to key variants.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is any additional variant testing required as part of the initial EUA submission for manufacturers submitting a point-of-care nucleoprotein-based antigen test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So let me, you know, ask the question of you, because I am going to reach out to all of the EUA authorized antigen test developers. You know, can you use say even activated antigen or virus and/or a radiated virus from BEI, because this - if we can - if antigen tests can - those antigen tests that can use this and of course a lot of this is going to be comparing to the original strain that was deposited at BEI and we typically think of that as anything comparing to that. But if an antigen test is amenable for use of inactivated virus that makes all of our lives a lot easier as far as testing reactivity and inclusivity. And it's my understanding that the UK variants have been deposited BEI and I'm just going to be double checking with them that they are planning to inactivate that. So we haven't figured that all out yet. We just know that at least for key variants we're going to start wanting to know, you know, if there's any loss of sensitivity with those variants. And we're trying to figure out the very best way to do this and using live virus in a lab is not ideal. But if inactivated virus can be used then potentially panels can be distributed to developers and to tests that are already on the market.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA is working on updating templates and guidance to address monitoring of variants, focusing initially on the UK, South African, and Brazilian variants. Other variants may also impact test sensitivity or vaccine efficacy, making this a high priority for FDA.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Should we test only the UK, South African, and Brazilian variants, or how can we best keep current on the types of variants to test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So we are working through this process. So in all likelihood we'll be updating template; in all likelihood we'll be updating letters of authorization of these going forward; in how best to do this. So, and we're just at the beginning stages of thinking through this. It would be ideal if we can be using in silico analysis to some degree. We use it of course for molecular. But if we could start using it for antigen and serology tests. So we are going to start beginning to ask developers how they think they can monitor variants for variants of concern. And obviously I've mentioned three variants - South African, UK and Brazilian. But there could be - and those are important because they appear to be more infectious and could have potential impact on the vaccine efficacy. So - but there could be one or more variants out there that in accumulation, could start to depress the sensitivity of assays. There's even some cases we're thinking in serology examples, typically for neutralizing antibodies, where there could potentially be false positives. Right? So you have neutralizing antibodies to, you know, a prior infection but not to, you know, some of the variants. So all I can say right now is this is one of our top priorities if not the top priority right now, for our office and our center and the ability of the agency as well, to try to figure out how to best do this.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Do you recommend reaching out to the EUA before the template update to obtain specific guidance on variant testing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: You can, but I don't think we're ready to give recommendations right now. We're focused on, you know, we're doing it for molecular. And all molecular developers do this in the process of submitting their application. They survey the landscape. I just - since we don't have a solution that's really workable yet, for antigen and serology, I don't want to be making recommendations about that. But other than to - we want to know what your thoughts are about these. And as we develop our knowledge base and information base and as we discover ways to do this better, we may update those recommendations. But certainly, if you want to bring it up I'm not holding you back. I mean I think it's a sign of a good developer that brings up these issues. I just don't want to hold back authorization until we can figure out how to do this right.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA requires validation data for the new proprietary transport media to demonstrate its performance and equivalency to UTM, as it is unknown how the new media performs.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What additional data is required to compare the performance of a new proprietary transport media to UTM in the evaluation process?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. So it's important to validate it with the transport media you're going to use for the test. And so if you are going to - so we certainly can give, you know, a moderate or high complex authorization based on banked samples and use of UTM for transport media. But you've got a new media and we don't know how it performs at all and we don't know if it's equivalent to UTM or not. And so we do need to look at the data for the new media.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the specific guidelines on matching sample collection methods between retrospective and prospective studies (e.g., dry swabs vs. transport media)?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA requires that the sample collection method in retrospective and prospective studies match. If using dry swabs, both banked and fresh studies should use them. If using transport media, the same media must be used to ensure valid comparisons.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the specific guidelines on matching sample collection methods between retrospective and prospective studies (e.g., dry swabs vs. transport media)?
VERBATIM ANSWER: You know, if your test is dry swab then we want to see - you can have collection of frozen banked dry swabs and the fresh study needs to be in dry swabs. But if it's in transport media it needs to be in the same transport media, so that we can use the data from the banked samples to presume performance of the test with only a handful of fresh samples to prove that fresh samples work pre-market.

#### 11. Defining Asymptomatic Screening Timeframes for Antigen Testing

QA Block 11-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What timeframe would be considered appropriate to define no symptoms and no known contact with someone who is positive for antigen test asymptomatic screening?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA suggests a timeframe of at least 14 to 21 days to define no symptoms and no known contact. However, they recommend checking with the Templates email or a reviewer for confirmation of the appropriate timeframe.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What timeframe would be considered appropriate to define no symptoms and no known contact with someone who is positive for antigen test asymptomatic screening?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So the goal of this is not to enrich with people who might be pre- symptomatic, right, and if they were exposed recently. That would, you know, potentially, you know, give the candidate test an advantage and not truly test what we're looking for is an asymptomatic population. Formerly we have defined asymptomatic as at the time of testing they have no symptoms and they don't have any prior test results, positive test results or symptoms. I would think - I'm not sure if we have a specific day in mind here. But it would probably need to be in at least the 14 to 21 days. You know, I think that's something that I can't give a formal answer on because I don't have a prepared response today. So, you know, it's probably best to check with the Templates email in our email box - or if you already have the reviewer, with the reviewer for what the update of unknown symptoms should be, prior to testing, or no exposure prior to testing.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the FDA recommend a minimum or maximum number of days for no symptoms or exposure before testing to define an asymptomatic population?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends avoiding individuals who are pre-symptomatic by ensuring at least 14 to 21 days with no symptoms or known exposure before testing for asymptomatic screening. However, no formal timeframe is definitively set, and further clarification should be sought via the Templates email or from a reviewer.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the sensitivity requirement for breath test screening?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA has not yet established specific sensitivity targets for breath test screening and is actively working on recommendations. Developers should validate appropriately and consider both symptomatic and asymptomatic claims. Sensitivity or PPA relative to molecular tests is expected to meet high standards, especially for asymptomatic screening.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the sensitivity requirement for breath test screening?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. Yes. So this is an important question and in fact, our team - I've charged our team with coming up with targets for this. They promised me today and - but probably by the end of the day, and… So, you know, you could imagine - and I'll just, you know, talk a little bit philosophy on a nonstandard sort of test. First of all, we're very open to novel tests. We have no idea if breath tests, you know, truly can perform, but we're totally open to it. We do want to have them validated appropriately and since they're a newer technology we're likely to ask for more than sort of the standard technology samples. So I don't know if they gave you sample numbers yet. But we're working on them as well. You could imagine that the breath test might be used for either diagnostic purposes and/or asymptomatic screening, surveillance. You know, the FDA data for this pandemic we don't intend to regulate for surveillance. So the other thing about breath tests because there may be other breath test developers out there, is that we are concerned with potential carryover from one patient to the next. So that will be an important consideration of the safety and may not be in the recommendations yet. But I think there's going to be challenges with whether a developer wants to pursue, you know, symptomatic claims or asymptomatic claims. You know, some - there is some thought. Just to be open that, you know, we don't know if symptomatic or asymptomatic claims are necessarily the best claim to go to first, because some of the symptoms, you know, ideally might need a, you know, a test that has a longer proven track record. On the other hand, we have a huge need to expand testing into the asymptomatic in screening population. And so that might be the more ideal population. I - there's no, you know, we're open to all comers here. So if you want to come in and you want to pursue symptomatic claims, we'll look into what that looks like. But I do see the sweet spot potentially for the technology - if it can perform, in the asymptomatic population. And that it could really address some of our needs to really increase the - not only the amount of testing but the frequency so that everybody can get tested at will. So we'll want to look at in that population - in whatever population, we'll want to look at, you know, what is the sensitivity or PPA relative to a molecular test. High sensitivity in molecular test and also the specificity and/or NPA. So does it call any false positives? Now, you know, it could be that for benefit risk calculations we may, you know, decide that positives should be, you know, double checked with the molecular tests and so that is some of the thinking that we're looking at right now. However, if the NPA is - I mean if the PPA and NPV, negative predictive value, is extremely high for say people in the asymptomatic population, that could be - that could really be a win. And so I'm just thinking through all the calculations right now. So I think we're going to ask for more positives and more negatives than we typically had. And we're working with our statistician on determining what that - what our recommendations are going to be there. So stay tuned. I think we'll be able to update our thinking hopefully by next week so that we can share with developers our latest thinking on that.

VERBATIM QUESTION: When using retrospective UTM samples for validation, is a full fresh prospective enrollment study necessary with proprietary transport media for EUA submission?
