#### 3. Resolving Discordant Results in Saliva and NP Testing

QA Block 3-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the FDA EUA template include information on investigating discordant results between saliva and NP swab specimens?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends using a high-sensitivity molecular assay with extraction as the comparator when investigating discordant results between saliva and NP swabs, with a preference for NP swabs due to challenges with some saliva-based assays.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA EUA template include information on investigating discordant results between saliva and NP swab specimens?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So the NP swab when validating oral fluid or saliva, that is a recommendation using NP swab. The NP swab we recommend you use a high sensitivity molecular assay with an extraction in the procedure, as the comparator. Now you could have discordant results between saliva and that NP result. Hopefully minimal, but we've seen it in some cases and, you know, from early days. And for whatever reason, some saliva used in some assays, does - and oral fluids, does present a challenge for some assays. So that's why we continue our recommendation for NP swabs. So I think hopefully you're still on the line, you can clarify your question about how to resolve discordances between a comparator test done with the NP swab and the candidate test done with saliva.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Brian Jones
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: EUA template, Discordant results, Testing comparator methods
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 3-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is it acceptable to test a saliva-based candidate assay against another EUA-authorized test for NP swabs if it hasn't been authorized for saliva?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA advises checking with their review team if choosing to use another EUA-authorized test for NP swabs to evaluate discordant results with a saliva-based assay. Using a composite comparator may also be possible with established rules and annotations.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is it acceptable to test a saliva-based candidate assay against another EUA-authorized test for NP swabs if it hasn't been authorized for saliva?
VERBATIM ANSWER: On the other hand, if we've allowed it in the past and you want to pursue this route I would get, you know, I would get concurrence on the FDA review team through your interactions, you know, directly with the reviewer or through the Templates email address or a pre-EUA. You can use a composite - you can do discrepant resolution. I forget what our minimum recommendations are. Probably if you want to, you know, resolve FDA Townhall both positives and negatives that you do equal numbers of both. The table could be annotated if you do that, which means in the footer you can explain what the alternative method results are. It should be another high sensitivity comparator test with an extraction, molecular test. There is a way to do a composite result. So the comparator rather than being a single test could be two or more tests. If you do that for all samples you can have a composite comparator. There would need to be rules established like perhaps it's both tests could be positive or only one could be positive. Again, if you're going to go that route, I would double check with our review team.

#### 4. FDA Notification Acceptance Process and Distribution Guidelines

QA Block 4-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Could you provide an update on the notification acceptance process and timing?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA sends an automated email upon submission, reviews the notification to check key criteria, and then provides formal acceptance through a subsequent email. The process usually takes up to 48 hours or two business days. If delayed, developers are advised to follow up.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Could you provide an update on the notification acceptance process and timing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So from the beginning you get an email response that says that you had submitted, you know, it's an automated response. But our team assesses the request and makes sure that some key boxes are checked there, to make sure that it's something that we can allow to go up on our notification list. So the official response for allowing notification comes in a subsequent email. We typically try to turn that around pretty quickly. So if it is taking more than 48 hours and two business days to get a response, I would ping them again, and I would also - you can let Toby and I know, through the Templates email address and we can look into a specific situation. Hopefully that's helpful.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Does FDA ever deny distribution at the notification review stage?
VERBATIM ANSWER: …you know, some situations where developers have sent notifications for tests that are not eligible for the notification policy. And so just to clarify for everyone, obviously I don't know which test you're referring to so I don't know if this applies to you, but just to clarify, for everyone listening, you know, one of the areas especially for serology tests, is home collection with dry blood spots is not - and home collection at all, for both serology and diagnostic tests, is not eligible for the notification policy. So that is one area where we've seen a number of notifications come in that we've had to respond back to the developer to tell them that they cannot distribute yet, because that is not under the notification policy.

We review test submissions and look at to make sure that it's an accurate test, and if we can FDA Townhall authorize it, we'll authorize it. We also don't - can't really tell a developer how they go ahead and commercialize. So once we've authorized an at home test or a home collection kit that goes up on our Web site and it's really, you know, up to the test developer to figure out how they make that available to patients and consumers. In some cases the US government funds efforts to make these tests widely available and you've probably seen some press announcements about that.

#### 6. Defining High Throughput and Serology Test Prioritization

QA Block 6-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Could FDA provide a definition or description of what constitutes a high throughput test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: High throughput tests are determined fluidly. FDA recommends using the pre-EUA process or the Templates email box to confirm if a test qualifies. Additionally, high priority tests include various serology tests and neutralization tests.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can FDA provide a definition or description of what constitutes a high throughput test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So yes, high throughput is something that can be fluid. And so we haven't posted that information. But you can check through the pre-EUA process or perhaps send a question to the Templates email box if your test would qualify as high throughput. And as far as the other priorities, serology tests that are point of care; serology tests that are at home; or serology collection - home collection kits; as well as serology high throughput tests, are all high priority tests. I would also say that neutralization tests, serology neutralization tests are also currently high priority. We've only authorized one.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA acknowledges that CT values above 30 cannot determine infectivity based on guidance from CDC, APHL, and CAP. Culture methods are inadequate, and early symptom CT values can be elevated but still indicate contagiousness. Molecular testing remains the gold standard, especially within the first five days of symptoms when patients are more infectious.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How is the FDA viewing the recent studies that compare PCR to culture, specifically for CT values over 30 being considered noninfectious samples?
VERBATIM ANSWER: It is important. That's a question that we get frequently. The CDC, APHL, and CAP have all said that CTs cannot be used to determine infectivity. Culture is a notoriously insensitive method. Now if you're positive via a culture method then you would know there was intact virus that would potentially infect others. But a negative doesn't mean - well I have not seen any outcome studies relative to this hypothesis and I think it may not be ethical to put people at risk of contracting the virus just to test a hypothesis like this. I think if you searched the literature you will also see that - and we have data that's not public, that in the first five days of symptoms patients can have very high CTs on any given molecular result, a comparative result. As high as 40 and but well over 30. In fact, we often see up to 25% of the results from the first five days of symptoms, above 30. You know, someone who has symptoms in the first five days of symptoms and then has COVID confirmed by a high specificity, high sensitivity molecular assay, probably needs to be deemed potentially contagious. So that's, you know, that's just science. And, you know, that's what we're basing our decisions on. Now that said, we are encouraging all rapid to come in. Rapid tests can get authorized, you know, we've authorized tests that have only been examined in the first five days of symptoms. And, you know, if they perform well in those first five days when people were generally thought to be more infectious, compared to molecular tests, which is comparisons made there for accuracy. FDA Townhall We want to know if patients in the first five days of symptoms, really have COVID or not. And, you know, molecular is the gold standard to tell us that. We are not looking at whether an antigen test is accurate, you know, two weeks out or three weeks out. So we believe this is a very reasonable recommendation for validation. The other thing is that, you know, we just don't know for sure although I think there's some data that's creeping out. You know, what the initial - when someone first begins to shed virus, you know, is it really high amounts or could it be really low amounts? And we look forward to seeing what that portends. But we would love to see a direct diagnostic test perform very well in those early days of viral shedding. So hopefully that addresses the question.

QA Block 8-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is it relevant to compare antigen to PCR in populations with a CT value over 30 given these studies?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Comparing antigen to PCR in populations with high CT values is not supported strongly due to inconsistent infectivity determination using CTs and lack of quantitative assay validation. FDA emphasizes molecular tests over rapid tests for early, accurate detection during initial contagious phases.

QA Block 8-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the FDA's stance on the reliability of CT values as a marker for infectivity?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA does not consider CT values reliable for determining infectivity, as stated by CDC, APHL, and CAP. Culture methods are insensitive, and CT values vary widely, particularly in the first five days of symptoms. Patients can still be infectious even with high CT values.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the FDA consider culture methods an effective way to validate infectivity in diagnostic testing?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA considers culture methods to be insensitive. While a positive culture indicates intact, potentially infectious virus, a negative result does not confirm the absence of infectivity. There are no outcome studies supporting this approach, and ethical concerns exist around testing this hypothesis.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: How does the FDA evaluate antigen test performance specifically for the first five days of symptoms?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA evaluates antigen test performance for the first five days of symptoms based on comparisons to molecular tests, which are considered the gold standard. Tests performing well during this period, when individuals are thought to be more infectious, can be authorized. The focus is not on accuracy at later stages of the illness.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Why does the FDA view respiratory samples as inconsistent for reliable quantitative viral load monitoring?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA finds respiratory samples unreliable for quantitative viral load monitoring due to inconsistent virus shedding throughout the day or over multiple days.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Why does the FDA view respiratory samples as inconsistent for reliable quantitative viral load monitoring?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The challenge with that is even if you have a quantitative molecular assay, a very good molecular assay, it's pretty clear to me at least, and I think many people, that a respiratory sample from a swab, you know, is just not something that is going to be consistent throughout a day or over time.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Do you have any general recommendations for bridging studies to leverage existing data and integrate it with US centers?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. So I don't, you know, bridging studies are done on the same sample but in - on different devices. You know, so - but it may be that you've already had some point of care studies done outside the US. And if it's, you know, through discussion with the FDA review team, if those are relatively closely mimic what a point of care site would be in the United States, you know, I'll leave it up to the review team to assess that. But it could be that you add to what you already have; you don't necessarily repeat everything that we would ask for, in the US, that we would ask for, for a point of care study. So again, it's situational. The team will want to look into, you know, your technology; what you've done; and look at the sites that - and the characteristics, the sites where you did the point of care study, to assess that.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA will assess how non-US point of care study sites closely mimic US settings. Criteria such as the technology used, existing data, study sites, and their characteristics will be evaluated, and a review team will determine acceptability.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are there specific characteristics or criteria FDA uses to assess whether non-US point of care study sites closely mimic US settings?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. So I don't, you know, bridging studies are done on the same sample but in - on different devices. You know, so - but it may be that you've already had some point of care studies done outside the US. And if it's, you know, through discussion with the FDA review team, if those are relatively closely mimic what a point of care site would be in the United States, you know, I'll leave it up to the review team to assess that. But it could be that you add to what you already have; you don't necessarily repeat everything that we would ask for, in the US, that we would ask for, for a point of care study. So again, it's situational. The team will want to look into, you know, your technology; what you've done; and look at the sites that - and the characteristics, the sites where you did the point of care study, to assess that.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can data from point of care studies conducted in central labs with fully trained laboratorians be used in FDA submissions, and under what conditions?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Fully trained laboratorian data collected in central labs is not acceptable as point-of-care data. Developers can submit a pre-EUA to propose alternative approaches for review by the FDA.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can data from point of care studies conducted in central labs with fully trained laboratorians be used in FDA submissions, and under what conditions?
VERBATIM ANSWER: And we've clearly seen FDA Townhall some developers do "point of care" study in, you know, central labs with trained - fully trained laboratoriansAnd that's obviously not. And that may be where point of care testing is done in some countries. But it's not where it's done in our country. So that is our recommendation.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: How does FDA evaluate the relevance of point of care study data collected under non-US healthcare practices?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends conducting point of care studies in the US due to challenges in comparing foreign healthcare settings to US practices. Developers may discuss with the review team to determine if non-US data is acceptable, potentially supplementing with additional US-focused studies.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How does FDA evaluate the relevance of point of care study data collected under non-US healthcare practices?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So we do recommend that point of care studies and home studies are done in the US. It's sometimes very challenging to assess how closely settings outside the US would mimic settings inside the US. And we've clearly seen FDA Townhall some developers do "point of care" study in, you know, central labs with trained - fully trained laboratoriansAnd that's obviously not.

#### 11. FDA Authorization Requirements for Home Test Reporting Mechanisms

QA Block 11-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Would FDA grant authorization for a prescription at-home test if mechanisms were not in place to report results back to the prescribing healthcare provider?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA does not require mechanisms to report results back to the prescribing provider as a condition for authorization of prescription at-home tests, but they encourage users to share results with their clinicians.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Would FDA grant authorization for a prescription at-home test if mechanisms were not in place to report results back to the prescribing healthcare provider?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So if it's by prescription there's automatically some relationship between the prescriber and the patient. They are somehow connected, right? And the reporting that we recommend but don't - let me say this. I mean we encourage - I think and usually the labeling of a test that we've authorized in this setting, we do suggest that the home test user relay their results to their clinician and discuss the results with them. But the FDA has no way of enforcing that. And we don't make it a requirement for authorization of point of care tests and/or home tests that there is a mechanism prior to authorization, of reporting results. we do ask in the templates, what are your plans to allow that reporting? The - we - and just so folks on the call know, there is a vast under reporting of point of care results in the US. And in home, home use tests.

VERBATIM QUESTION: If tests were purchased by a university and distributed to students under a standing order from a healthcare provider, would it be acceptable for results to not be shared with the prescribing healthcare provider?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So if you look at the tests that we've authorized, we make - there's labeling in there that suggests that results should be reported. If you're in a school setting, I think you want to know - the school wants to know those results. Right? So you want to know that - you're having them do testing for a reason. So, you know, as far as the details go, I don't know that it's under the purview of the FDA. It's more under the practice of medicine. And that's governed more by state and local rules and laws. So what we ask for prescription tests is that they are prescribed and then we have our labeling that we authorize in the tests for suggestions on what to do. And there are flexibilities there. You know, someone is doing a blanket clinical order for testing, they can provide information in addition to what information you can get from the tests, in the test kit, or even the patient in healthcare provider fact sheets that the FDA posts online. A prescriber can, you know, say hey, you know, if you're positive do this; if you're negative do this, don't do this, or whatever. So it's really up to the prescriber. Tests by prescription for this very purpose, have another mitigation that allows us to have a lower bar for prescription tests if a clinician is involved and can advise their patient, you know, about these things.

#### 12. Pooling Validation Requirements for Asymptomatic Molecular Testing

QA Block 12-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does pooled testing of asymptomatic individuals require both asymptomatic and pooling schemes to be validated as per the template?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Pooling of asymptomatic individuals requires validating both pooling and asymptomatic use according to FDA standards, and developers should ensure the test's accuracy through data submission or a clinical study.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does pooled testing of asymptomatic individuals require both asymptomatic and pooling schemes to be validated as per the template?
VERBATIM ANSWER: That's getting into the weeds. But we certainly encourage a pooling. We think it's a great way to expand testing. It's a great - it's great if kit manufacturers validate pooling so that their customers don't have to validate anything themselves. They simply follow the pooling instructions in the authorization. Pooling can be launched without prior - prior to an FDA authorization. So developers of a kit can validate pooling, you know, in launch and within Toby, 15 business days to submit - no, no, rather they have to submit but they don't have to have a decision on the pooling scheme. They can launch right away. So make your - validate your pooling, submit it to the FDA, then you can launch. With asymptomatic we do want to see enough asymptomatic to know that the test is accurate, the conjoining of pooling and asymptomatic. Because if something's not authorized for pooling and there are no limitations - there are some tests, rare tests that are limited to symptomatic patients only, there's - we haven't given that limitation. We're, you know, we're not objecting to prescriptions for off-label use by clinicians if they want to use a test that's authorized for asymptomatic. But it's really a question of asymptomatic pooling. I think, you know, that's best, you know, interacted with our team. But, you know, we're going to look at what are - from your particular tests what are the CT distribution of your asymptomatic population? FDA Townhall We're going to look at the CT distribution for your symptomatic population and we're going to look at what the impact of your pooling scheme is on CTs for positives that are pooled. And we probably can make an assessment about whether the data is adequate to be authorized.

#### 13. Evaluating Test Accuracy Against Emerging COVID-19 Variants

QA Block 13-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the current thinking regarding the ability of QPCR tests to detect new highly infectious variants?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA issued a safety alert regarding variants and emphasises that QPCR test developers should evaluate test performance against known variants like South African, Brazilian, and UK. Developers are encouraged to check their assays for mutations above 5% prevalence and design tests targeting multiple conserved viral regions to minimize performance degradation from mutations. Tests unable to detect prevalent variants may face approval risks.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the current thinking regarding the ability of QPCR tests to detect new highly infectious variants?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We issued a safety alert around the variants. We described three tests that we saw that there was impact - potential impact based on variants. We describe that some - I think that from the beginning we've been asking developers to take a look at the sequence in the database and do an in silico analysis. We would specifically call out anything that we know is in the database at a percent above 5%, especially in recent weeks and months. Because we see that as potentially even one mutation if it's 5% or above, could really degrade performance. And we want to know for our new submissions, know what the impact on the test is. And we would also look to the known key important variants out there like South African, Brazilian and UK, and look at and assess performance. I can't pre-judge what our teams would say because there could be simply a limitation that says they can't detect the UK variant or it can't detect South African. But I think both of those are increasing rapidly in our population and would probably - if a test, a new submission could not detect those, it would put that submission at risk. I do recommend that - or I do encourage, not necessarily recommend, that all developers consider this. That all developers look at their assays now. But in the development of the assays that they look at this potentiality. We know that assays that target multiple parts of the virus are going to - especially the multiple very conserve parts of the virus, are going to be less impacted going forward, by accumulation of more mutations than the virus and variants of importance.

FDA advises test developers to use this method to assess the ability of their tests to detect key variants.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is an in silico analysis and how should COVID-19 test developers utilize it for variant assessment?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We described three tests that we saw that there was impact - potential impact based on variants. We describe that some - I think that from the beginning we've been asking developers to take a look at the sequence in the database and do an in silico analysis. FDA Townhall We would specifically call out anything that we know is in the database at a percent above 5%, especially in recent weeks and months. Because we see that as potentially even one mutation if it's 5% or above, could really degrade performance. And we want to know for our new submissions, know what the impact on the test is. And we would also look to the known key important variants out there like South African, Brazilian and UK, and look at and assess performance.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What steps does the FDA recommend developers take to assess the performance of their tests against key variants?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA advises developers to conduct in silico analyses using database sequences, focusing on variants with 5% frequency or higher. Developers should assess their tests against key variants like South African, Brazilian, and UK strains. Assays targeting multiple conserved viral regions are less likely to be impacted by mutations.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can a test authorized under EUA for NP swabs be used for saliva validation by comparing saliva and NP swab performance using the same assay?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA prefers using a different NP comparator test than the candidate assay being validated. However, using the same assay has been allowed in the past, subject to confirmation with the FDA review team. A composite comparator involving multiple tests can also be used with predefined rules. Verify with the FDA review team for guidance.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can a test authorized under EUA for NP swabs be used for saliva validation by comparing saliva and NP swab performance using the same assay?

It's a little bit cleaner that way as far as, you know, a good - it may be in earlier days we didn't have many options too, so we may have allowed them. On the other hand, if we've allowed it in the past and you want to pursue this route I would get, you know, I would get concurrence on the FDA review team through your interactions, you know, directly with the reviewer or through the Templates email address or a pre-EUA.

The table could be annotated if you do that, which means in the footer you can explain what the alternative method results are. It should be another high sensitivity comparator test with an extraction, molecular test. There is a way to do a composite result. So the comparator rather than being a single test could be two or more tests. If you do that for all samples you can have a composite comparator. There would need to be rules established like perhaps it's both tests could be positive or only one could be positive. Again, if you're going to go that route, I would double check with our review team. Okay? Hopefully that's helpful. But it's certainly allowed to do resolution of those discrepants.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Do you need to conduct pooling using asymptomatic samples during the validation of asymptomatic testing?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA encourages pooling to expand testing. While pooling can be launched without FDA authorization, enough data on asymptomatic samples must be provided to show accuracy for authorization. Pooling and asymptomatic testing must align, and developers should contact the FDA for guidance.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Do you need to conduct pooling using asymptomatic samples during the validation of asymptomatic testing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: That's getting into the weeds. But we certainly encourage a pooling. We think it's a great way to expand testing. It's a great - it's great if kit manufacturers validate pooling so that their customers don't have to validate anything themselves. They simply follow the pooling instructions in the authorization. Pooling can be launched without prior - prior to an FDA authorization. So developers of a kit can validate pooling, you know, in launch and within Toby, 15 business days to submit - no, no, rather they have to submit but they don't have to have a decision on the pooling scheme. They can launch right away. So make your - validate your pooling, submit it to the FDA, then you can launch. With asymptomatic we do want to see enough asymptomatic to know that the test is accurate, the conjoining of pooling and asymptomatic. Because if something's not authorized for pooling and there are no limitations - there are some tests, rare tests that are limited to symptomatic patients only, there's - we haven't given that limitation. We're, you know, we're not objecting to prescriptions for off-label use by clinicians if they want to use a test that's authorized for asymptomatic. But it's really a question of asymptomatic pooling. I think, you know, that's best, you know, interacted with our team. But, you know, we're going to look at what are - from your particular tests what are the CT distribution of your asymptomatic population? FDA Townhall We're going to look at the CT distribution for your symptomatic population and we're going to look at what the impact of your pooling scheme is on CTs for positives that are pooled. And we probably can make an assessment about whether the data is adequate to be authorized. So it's a little bit hard to pre- judge, but once we have the data or you want to run a clinical trial or a clinical study and SOP bias, you can do that as well.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Is there any requirement for tests already on the market to demonstrate their ability to detect the new variants?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We described three tests that we saw that there was impact - potential impact based on variants. We describe that some - I think that from the beginning we've been asking developers to take a look at the sequence in the database and do an in silico analysis. FDA Townhall We would specifically call out anything that we know is in the database at a percent above 5%, especially in recent weeks and months. Because we see that as potentially even one mutation if it's 5% or above, could really degrade performance. And we want to know for our new submissions, know what the impact on the test is. And we would also look to the known key important variants out there like South African, Brazilian and UK, and look at and assess performance. I can't pre-judge what our teams would say because there could be simply a limitation that says they can't detect the UK variant or it can't detect South African. But I think both of those are increasing rapidly in our population and would probably - if a test, a new submission could not detect those, it would put that submission at risk. We do - I do recommend that - or I do encourage, not necessarily recommend, that all developers consider this. That all developers look at their assays now. But in the development of the assays that they look at this potentiality.
