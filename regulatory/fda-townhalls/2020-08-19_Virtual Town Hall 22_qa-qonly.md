#### 1. Updates on FDA Testing Guidelines and Authorizations

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What changes were made in the recent FAQ updates regarding screening and asymptomatic testing?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA updated its FAQs to clarify expectations for manufacturers and laboratories developing screening tests, emphasizing the need for EUA submissions for such claims. Healthcare providers may order tests for screening regardless of specific labeling, with considerations for test performance, turnaround time, and program integration provided in the FAQs.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What changes were made in the recent FAQ updates regarding screening and asymptomatic testing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So first we updated a couple of our FAQs regarding screening and asymptomatic testing. The intent of these updates was to make a more clear distinction between what we expect from manufacturers and laboratories that are offering the - a test for screening versus what health care providers can order. So we indicated in our FAQs that we do expect developers of tests both commercial manufacturers and clinical laboratories to consult our templates for validation recommendations and to submit an EUA for theirs tests when they want to make claims regarding screening of asymptomatic individuals. And then we also indicated in our FAQ that healthcare providers may order tests that are not specifically labeled for screening. They may order such tests for screening even if they're not labeled that way. And we include in our FAQ some considerations for healthcare providers including considering the performance of the tests that they're ordering considering the turnaround time and considering different testing approaches depending on the performance of the tests and the overall testing program that they're incorporating a test into.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)

QA Block 1-5
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How does the FDA categorize self-tests as 'non-lab' or 'at-home' tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA categorizes self-tests as 'non-lab' or 'at-home' based on their authorization for home use, which includes self-testing at various non-home and non-lab locations without personnel involvement.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How does the FDA categorize self-tests as 'non-lab' or 'at-home' tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We had originally referred to this as at-home testing and we had changed our terminology to non-lab to try to be more clear that these tests may not strictly be performed in an individual's home but it looks like we may have caused more confusion. So we're working to clarify that. And we have had conversations with our CMS colleagues about this as well and we're on the same page there. The tests that we're referring to here are tests that FDA authorizes for home use. And when we refer to home use, we're really referring to self-testing. So the self-testing can take place in an individual's home or at another setting. So that's why we had referred to it as non-lab because the - an individual who is self-testing could do so at a school or at an airport or a sporting event or any other sort of non-home and non-lab setting where there is not personnel from that facility that's involved in the testing.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: Self-testing categorization, Non-lab tests, FDA terminology
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-6
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the specific CLIA requirements for non-lab or self-testing scenarios discussed by the FDA?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA clarified that self-testing, previously referred to as non-lab or at-home testing, can occur at various non-lab settings such as schools or events, without facility personnel conducting or interpreting the tests. These are designed to be entirely self-administered.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the specific CLIA requirements for non-lab or self-testing scenarios discussed by the FDA?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We got some questions after the town hall last week about the reference to non-lab testing and how that matched up with the CMS CLIA requirements for testing to be done in labs that are certified by CLIA. And so I wanted to make sure to provide a little bit more information around that and what we mean by non-lab testing. We had originally referred to this as at-home testing and we had changed our terminology to non-lab to try to be more clear that these tests may not strictly be performed in an individual's home but it looks like we may have caused more confusion. So we're working to clarify that. And we have had conversations with our CMS colleagues about this as well and we're on the same page there.

So what I mean by that is you know someone at a facility like a school or a or a sporting event for example could hand an individual a test but that facility personnel could not be involved in the sample collection or the performing of the test or the interpretation of the results. But if, you know, if there were - if we were to get to the point where we had a test that was simple enough for an individual to just, you know, perform themselves while standing outside of a building before they go in and that individual can provide the sample themselves, do whatever needs to be done to perform the testing and, you know, read and interpret the results themselves, that is what we would consider to be a self-test or an, you know, at home or non-lab test. And that's why we have put together that template for such tests that would not be performed within a CLIA laboratory.

VERBATIM QUESTION: IMPLICIT
VERBATIM ANSWER: Someone at a facility like a school or a sporting event could hand an individual a test, but that facility personnel could not be involved in the sample collection or the performing of the test or the interpretation of the results. If there were to be a test simple enough for an individual to perform themselves while standing outside of a building before going in, where the individual can provide the sample, perform the testing, and interpret the results themselves, that is what would be considered self-testing or a non-lab test.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Is the non-laboratory template suitable for tests performed outside home environments, such as schools or workplaces?
VERBATIM ANSWER: All right. For, you know, diagnostic or screening situations outside of a CLIA waive environment I'll just add a little bit more color to what Toby already has said about the non-lab setting. It can absolutely be a test that can be performed by a consumer or if it's prescription by under prescription by the individual outside of a lab setting. There's going to be situations where that need some of these tests may be authorized for testing kids and so, you know, a guardian or a parent or another a person given permission by the guardian or parent to administer the test outside of a lab situation we'll be considering those populations and those authorizations. So that - in that case it's not the person doing it on themselves but it's the person doing it on a child who's not capable of doing it on themselves. And we've looked at the safety situation there as far as the actual sample collection and all the reagents that are with the test. But to expand that there will be situations in these non-lab settings like workplace, obviously home, school. FDA Webinar So this is really anywhere there's not a - going be a CLIA certificate available. And we do want to make these tests available in those settings as well both by prescription and by over the counter. And the non-lab template is for - what it sounds like as long as you're going for screening or diagnostic indications is a good one for you to look at. And it is just to add color to what Toby said it is can be outside of the home environment as well.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Do pharmacies need a CLIA waiver certificate if their personnel assist in COVID-19 testing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. A lot of pharmacies do have certificates of waiver from CLIA and if they - if the personnel at that facility at the pharmacy are assisting in the testing then, my understanding from CMS is that they would expect the facility to have a CLIA certificate. If they are simply providing a self-test that the individual performs on themselves and interprets themselves then the facility would not need a certificate.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the specific requirements for obtaining a CLIA certificate of waiver for non-traditional testing environments like workplaces or schools?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: CLIA certificates of waiver can be obtained from CMS, and schools can acquire them for district-wide use. If personnel like school nurses conduct tests, a waiver is required. However, testing by individuals without facility assistance falls under the non-laboratory use template.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the specific requirements for obtaining a CLIA certificate of waiver for non-traditional testing environments like workplaces or schools?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Typically those would be certificates of waiver which are fairly straightforward to take out from CMS. If it is, you know, in a school we do have, you know, we have had discussions with the CLIA program at CMS and they do provide CLIA certificates of waiver to schools. They have programs in place to do that, you know, on a broad, you know school district level for example. And if it is a situation where, you know, as you suggested perhaps the school nurse is providing the test and performing the test, that is a situation where CMS would expect the school to have a certificate of waiver to provide that testing. But if it is a situation where the individual or perhaps or their parent or guardian is performing the testing without the assistance of a personnel from the facility that would be - that would fall under the new non-laboratory use template.

VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the process for assigning a test submission into the triage program and how does a test submission get out of it?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, I can take a crack at that and Toby can fill in. So are our reviewers are obviously their desks and plates are very full with submissions and reviews. And in order to get through them as quickly as possible we have a program that when we receive an application we want to make sure it's not something that requires an EUA to launch that is if there's a notification pathway for the test and/or it doesn't have - it meets one of our other definitions for something that would be put into a high priority category. And then if it doesn't meet any of those categories and perhaps even if it does if our reviewers' plates are full, there is a triage program or I wouldn't call it triage. There's just a program that puts applications with somebody who can keep in contact with the developer and give them a status update at least on a weekly basis as to where their application is in the process. And as soon as a space opens up on reviewers' plates then we put in those submissions based on the kinds of priorities that I discussed onto the next open reviewers' slot that they are carrying a number of applications all at once and then the beginning of a true interactive review can happen. So typically those happen for tests that can be launched through the notification pathway prior to an EUA authorization.

QA Block 7-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is the prioritization based on CDC categorization of how a test will be used or by some other method?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Prioritization is based on whether a test is for point-of-care use, which requires EUA authorization, making it a higher priority.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is the prioritization based on CDC categorization of how a test will be used or by some other method?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So, you know, anything that's the point of care if it's truly going to be used at point of care does require an EUA authorization to deem it as CLIA waived or non-lab or home collection situations. So those all require EUAs and so they aren't allowed to launch for those indications until they have that EUA authorization. So those are the ones in greatest need to be able to offer that test in the US. So those and those do get a higher priority because of that requirement.

VERBATIM QUESTION: What specific information is required for a point-of-care test application to ensure prioritization under the review process?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So, you know, anything that's the point of care if it's truly going to be used at point of care does require an EUA authorization to deem it as CLIA waived or non-lab or home collection situations. So those all require EUAs and so they aren't allowed to launch for those indications until they have that EUA authorization. So those are the ones in greatest need to be able to offer that test in the US. So those and those do get a higher priority because of that requirement. So if all the point of care test information is in the application for the reviewer to review then they would receive - that would receive a higher priority in our review process because they can't notify and launch point of care.

#### 10. Challenges and Validation of Saliva-Based COVID-19 Testing

QA Block 10-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How did the Yale team and others address the issue of inconsistencies with saliva in direct antigen tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA acknowledges challenges with saliva inconsistencies in direct antigen tests due to variability in performance compared to nasopharyngeal or mid-turbinate swabs. Despite limited understanding, FDA has authorized multiple methods and expects further authorizations for saliva testing in expanded testing scenarios.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How did the Yale team and others address the issue of inconsistencies with saliva in direct antigen tests?

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the FDA recommendations on the distribution of viral load ranges needed for saliva test validation?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends using a normal distribution of viral loads, from high to low, as measured by swab samples when validating saliva tests. Overloading with exclusively high or very low viral loads could distort performance evaluation.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the FDA recommendations on the distribution of viral load ranges needed for saliva test validation?
VERBATIM ANSWER: ...and it's putting pressure on swabs and transport media. And so we absolutely see utility in using saliva.

#### 11. Defining Point of Care Test Requirements and Validation

QA Block 11-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How does the FDA determine complexity for a point of care test to deem it sufficient for point of care designation?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA determines the complexity of point of care tests by ensuring they are easy to perform by non-laboratorians in a CLIA-waived setting using basic equipment. Simplicity, accuracy, and interpretation are key factors. Additionally, the FDA authorizes devices under CLIA-waived status during EUA reviews but makes the final formal categorization later through a normal submission process. Devices need sufficient validation to show they can be accurately performed under expected conditions.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How does the FDA determine complexity for a point of care test to deem it sufficient for point of care designation?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes so at a high level just to, you know, establish a baseline of understanding here, a point of care test should be easy to perform in a CLIA waived lab - a CLIA waived setting by non-laboratorians right, so anything that may require say precision pipetting or more advanced equipment that's not usually present or can't be provided in that setting. It - so it should be easy to perform. It should be something that also gives accurate results that can be easily read and easily interpreted okay? And it does loosely - we do loosely if that - now, you know, consider the point of care checklist that you referred to. But one thing to make clear is that we are not - we are deeming the CLIA waived status with authorizations. We are not making a final CLIA waiver decision or CLIA category decision for a particular device. Once that device is converted to a normal submission and we make a decision through the normal 510k de novo pathways then the formal CLIA categorization will be applied to that. One of the reasons for that is that we are - the bar here for sufficient clinical testing and performance is so much lower than our normal bar. And we want to make sure that when we make that final decision on the final device at conversion meets our CLIA performance considerations. So if you look at what we've authorized already, some of them were on instruments that we have previously waived. And as long as the workflow hasn't changed that would introduce any more challenges to the point of care setting, we have not required additional point of care studies. It's - but a device that has never been waived prior to the pandemic. We are asking for some very, you know, less - a lower bar as far as the amount of FDA Webinar validation goes for the CLIA waived setting to show that it can be easily and accurately performed and interpreted. And that includes any steps that there are - that there's appropriate guard band studies I call them but basically flex studies that look at if you shift time of reading, time of incubations beyond the package insert what is the what is the effect on result.

FDA's standards for point of care tests are reduced compared to typical lab diagnostics to ensure accuracy and ease of use in simpler settings.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are certain assay types more difficult to make a point of care case for than others?

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Would the FDA consider a 96 well plate-based assay for point of care testing if it met the criteria?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA noted that 96 well plate assays often involve precision steps unsuitable for non-laboratorians and may be prone to contamination. However, they remain open to evaluating specific tests, though such point of care assays are challenging to develop.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Would the FDA consider a 96 well plate-based assay for point of care testing if it met the criteria?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. So something that involves a 96 well plate usually involves precision typesetting something that a non-laboratorian would not be trained in. And I'm not going to say, you know, no until we see more details about a specific test. But it would be very challenging. Those lab environments are not set up to prevent cross-contamination, monitoring contamination -- things like that. So typically these point of care assays need to be self-contained so that disposal is easy and doesn't result in contaminating the work area where the testing is performed. So I'd encourage you to come in with some ideas, absolutely interested in point of care. They are - I have had experience developing point of care devices. They are and getting moved to the FDA. And they are before I joined the FDA and they are a bit more challenging to develop. We understand that. But you will see you will see more and more point of care tests authorized in this pandemic and hopefully in the near future that don't require instrumentation.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is the bar higher in terms of validation for a test to qualify as point of care compared to a lab-based assay or is it comparable or lower?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA has lowered the bar for point-of-care diagnostic devices compared to central lab tests, allowing for reduced sensitivity (e.g., 80% PPA for direct antigen tests) to prioritize rapid identification of high viral load or symptomatic patients.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is the bar higher in terms of validation for a test to qualify as point of care compared to a lab-based assay or is it comparable or lower?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The percent positive agreement or sensitivity and specificities are basically the same that we would allow - we have authorized the direct antigen test. Some of them at least initially were say at the 80% PPA or sensitivity mark in carry. And some of them I think still do carry a presumed negative claim. So, you know, we typically we think of a central lab saying molecular test as being able to do much better than an 80% PPA or sensitivity. But we do - we FDA Webinar have lowered the bar to these point of care devices as I mentioned sort of in the beginning of this call. If it's down to 80% for a point of care say direct antigen test and a molecular test we would authorize as well but there would be a limitation that the negatives might not really be negative. And so we have lowered the bar relative to what normally people think of as a central lab test. And one of the reasons for that is identifying this population of patients that have very high viral loads that are likely to be infectious or they're symptomatic and you want to know right away in a point of care center setting do they, you know, are they positive?

CLARIFIED ANSWER: Point of care tests must be easy to perform in a CLIA-waived setting by non-laboratorians, without requiring precision pipetting or advanced equipment. They should also provide accurate, easily read, and interpreted results. The FDA considers a lower bar for clinical testing during EUA authorization but applies formal CLIA categorization after full review.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the FDA's requirements for devices seeking point of care authorization to demonstrate they are easy to perform by non-laboratorians?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes so at a high level just to, you know, establish a baseline of understanding here, a point of care test should be easy to perform in a CLIA waived lab - a CLIA waived setting by non-laboratorians right, so anything that may require say precision pipetting or more advanced equipment that's not usually present or can't be provided in that setting. It - so it should be easy to perform. It should be something that also gives accurate results that can be easily read and easily interpreted okay? And it does loosely - we do loosely if that - now, you know, consider the point of care checklist that you referred to. But one thing to make clear is that we are not - we are deeming the CLIA waived status with authorizations. We are not making a final CLIA waiver decision or CLIA category decision for a particular device. Once that device is converted to a normal submission and we make a decision through the normal 510k de novo pathways then the formal CLIA categorization will be applied to that. One of the reasons for that is that we are - the bar here for sufficient clinical testing and performance is so much lower than our normal bar. And we want to make sure that when we make that final decision on the final device at conversion meets our CLIA performance considerations.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: How does the FDA evaluate instruments that have not been waived prior to the pandemic for point of care testing?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA uses a lower bar for validation of devices that have not been waived prior to the pandemic, focusing on whether they can be easily and accurately performed and interpreted in a CLIA-waived setting. This includes conducting guard band or flex studies to assess the impact of timing variations.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How does the FDA evaluate instruments that have not been waived prior to the pandemic for point of care testing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: It's - but a device that has never been waived prior to the pandemic. We are asking for some very, you know, less - a lower bar as far as the amount of FDA Webinar validation goes for the CLIA waived setting to show that it can be easily and accurately performed and interpreted. And that includes any steps that there are - that there's appropriate guard band studies I call them but basically flex studies that look at if you shift time of reading, time of incubations beyond the package insert what is the what is the effect on result. So hopefully that's helpful.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What criteria does the FDA use during the EUA review process to determine if a device qualifies for point of care testing?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA considers whether the test can be easily performed in a CLIA waived setting by non-laboratorians, provides accurate and interpretable results, and aligns with a looser consideration of the point of care checklist. However, full CLIA categorization is deferred until a formal submission through the 510(k) or de novo path. Clinical testing requirements for EUA are less stringent than for final approvals.

And we want to make sure that when we make that final decision on the final device at conversion meets our CLIA performance considerations. So if you look at what we've authorized already, some of them were on instruments that we have previously waived. And as long as the workflow hasn't changed that would introduce any more challenges to the point of care setting, we have not required additional point of care studies. It's - but a device that has never been waived prior to the pandemic. We are asking for some very, you know, less - a lower bar as far as the amount of FDA Webinar validation goes for the CLIA waived setting to show that it can be easily and accurately performed and interpreted. And that includes any steps that there are - that there's appropriate guard band studies I call them but basically flex studies that look at if you shift time of reading, time of incubations beyond the package insert what is the what is the effect on result. So hopefully that's helpful. Those who are seeking point of care tests here we - you can come in with the pre EUA and ask specific questions about whether your device, you know, in development would potentially meet the criteria for that. And then of course we make that decision during the formal EUA review process.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Under what conditions could devices that usually require laboratory settings, such as those utilizing 96-well plates, be considered for point of care authorization?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Devices involving 96-well plates face challenges being authorized for point of care due to their reliance on precision handling and contamination risks. However, FDA recommends submitting specifics to assess feasibility.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Under what conditions could devices that usually require laboratory settings, such as those utilizing 96-well plates, be considered for point of care authorization?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. So something that involves a 96 well plate usually involves precision typesetting something that a non-laboratorian would not be trained in. And I'm not going to say, you know, no until we see more details about a specific test. But it would be very challenging. Those lab environments are not set up to prevent cross-contamination, monitoring contamination -- things like that. So typically these point of care assays need to be self-contained so that disposal is easy and doesn't result in contaminating the work area where the testing is performed. So I'd encourage you to come in with some ideas, absolutely interested in point of care.

#### 12. FDA EUA Notification Process and Application Clarifications

QA Block 12-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is there a limit to how long a test can be on the notification pathway without substantive review or authorization by the FDA?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: There is no limit to how long a test can remain on the notification pathway. FDA's process involves triaging applications to prioritize public health needs and addressing any risks or missing elements before advancing to review.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is there a limit to how long a test can be on the notification pathway without substantive review or authorization by the FDA?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Well there is no limit. And what we do when we receive applications is, we have our expert review staff take a quick look at it and they do a couple of really key things when they take a good look at it. First of all does it fall into one of FDA Webinar these higher priority buckets that requires or would benefit, public health would really benefit from an authorization coming sooner than later? And then second are there any issues that we see? And that is, are there any performance characteristics, issues that would suggest there would be any sort of risk to public health? If there is that does get put into a higher priority bucket so that we can reach out to the developer and likely ask for some more information about what's going on. And, you know, and deal appropriately with the response that we get. And we have denied a number of assays that have fallen into that category already. And we maintain some of that list on our Web site. So the other thing they - we want them to do is note if there's any missing pieces to the application. And then they give that over to the assigned contact and that contact can provide that feedback to the developer. That is okay your application, you know, looks complete and we're in a holding pattern right now. And if you notified then you have confirmation of notification from us. That will happen. That doesn't have to wait on a reviewer. But also that contact can say, "Oh we took a look at it. We don't necessarily have many concerns at the moment but we noticed that you have these missing elements so that you can work on those." And those can be provided because we actually probably in most cases won't hand that application over to a reviewer until we think that the application is complete so the reviewer's making the most efficient use of their time and as rapidly as possible reaching authorization decisions for the items that are on their plate and they're not holding in holding patterns with a number of different developers. So hopefully that's helpful and answers your question.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: After submitting a test for notification, will we receive confirmation of notification if missing elements are identified by the triage reviewer, or only after the application is administratively complete?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA will provide confirmation of notification and work with you if missing elements are identified. A quick review will take place after submission to address prioritization, missing elements, or public health concerns.
VERBATIM QUESTION: After submitting a test for notification, will we receive confirmation of notification if missing elements are identified by the triage reviewer, or only after the application is administratively complete?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Well if we see any elements that are missing as called out in the guidance as far as what's allowed via an allowed notification option, we would work with you on that to make sure that those things are - have been validated for example. So if there's clearly something missing like, you know, there's no - but again the notification process can happen before the submission right. So we're - this is the honor system that you notify us that you've validated your test and then you have a certain period of time to submit the EUA.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the notification process for a test carry the same weight as announcing an EUA authorized test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA states that point-of-care tests requiring EUA authorization are prioritized, as they cannot launch without it. Tests eligible for the notification process carry less priority compared to those requiring EUA for specific settings.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the notification process for a test carry the same weight as announcing an EUA authorized test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So, you know, anything that's the point of care if it's truly going to be used at point of care does require an EUA authorization to deem it as CLIA waived or non-lab or home collection situations. So those all require EUAs and so they aren't allowed to launch for those indications until they have that EUA authorization. So those are the ones in greatest need to be able to offer that test in the US. So those and those do get a higher priority because of that requirement. So if all the point of care test information is in the application for the reviewer to review then they would receive - that would receive a higher priority in our review process because they can't notify and launch point of care.
