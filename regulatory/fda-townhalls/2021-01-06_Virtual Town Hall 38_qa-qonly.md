#### 1. FDA Updates on SARS-CoV-2 Testing and Variant Impact

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the key priorities for test submissions to receive expedited feedback during the EUA process?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA prioritizes tests with the greatest public health impact, including home tests, home collections, point-of-care tests, and high-volume central lab tests. Complete, clear submissions with necessary data, protocols, and demographic details are essential for expedited feedback.
VERBATIM QUESTION: IMPLICIT
VERBATIM ANSWER: We of course want to continue just to make clear what our priorities are. They're focused on those things that can have the greatest public health impact. So home tests, home collections, point of care tests and super high volume central lab tests. All, you know, primarily the diagnostic tests but obviously we look at serology tests as well. So, you know, these are our priorities. And if an application comes in and it's complete and picks one of these boxes, we will make it a priority to give you feedback as soon as possible and try to authorize these tests as soon as possible. We do continue to ask that the submissions are complete. That they're well written and clear so that our folks can rapidly assess the submission. We also need Why Missing data submitted in a common spreadsheet so that we can look at the data very quickly. We don't have to ask for this because we will ask for this. And really it's considered incomplete unless we have that Why Missing data which should have the results plus any demographics of the candidate test plus the comparative tests in enough detail. We also want to see your protocols for your clinical examination study - important and a detailed one. It's important to know how you selected samples, how you collected samples, how you tested samples, how you did the comparator assay. These are all really important questions. And we really can't make our assessment without them. So it only slows us down if we don't have complete information about these things.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Expedited feedback for EUA submissions, Test submission priorities, Submission completeness
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What specific data formats and spreadsheets does the FDA require for submissions to be considered complete?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA requires submissions to include clear and well-written data, specifically "Why Missing" data in a common spreadsheet format. This must include test results, demographics of the candidate test, and details of comparative tests. Submissions lacking this are deemed incomplete.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What specific data formats and spreadsheets does the FDA require for submissions to be considered complete?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We do continue to ask that the submissions are complete. That they're well written and clear so that our folks can rapidly assess the submission. We also need Why Missing data submitted in a common spreadsheet so that we can look at the data very quickly. We don't have to ask for this because we will ask for this. And really it's considered incomplete unless we have that Why Missing data which should have the results plus any demographics of the candidate test plus the comparative tests in enough detail.

REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What level of detail is expected in clinical examination study protocols submitted to the FDA?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA requires clinical examination study protocols to include detailed information on sample selection, collection, testing, and the comparator assay. Incomplete information will delay the assessment process.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What level of detail is expected in clinical examination study protocols submitted to the FDA?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We also want to see your protocols for your clinical examination study - important and a detailed one. It's important to know how you selected samples, how you collected samples, how you tested samples, how you did the comparator assay. These are all really important questions. And we really can't make our assessment without them. So it only slows us down if we don't have complete information about these things.

SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: clinical study protocols, FDA submission requirements, test validation
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How should developers ensure their molecular tests account for sequencing variants like the UK and South African mutations?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA advises developers to use whole genome sequencing tests and authorized resources like the Illumina Kit. Developers are asked to evaluate the potential impact of known variants on their tests' performance during the authorization process, and FDA uses bioinformatics to monitor mutations.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How should developers ensure their molecular tests account for sequencing variants like the UK and South African mutations?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We do have an interest in sequencing-based tests that can provide a whole genome sequence. Of course we've already authorized at least one such kit. That's the Illumina Kit. It is authorized and has within it reagents to sequence the entire genome. And that's been a great step forward that we authorized quite a long time ago before we really knew how important the mutations would be. The other thing that the FDA has been doing is on a regular basis of course with all applicants especially for the molecular assays we've been asking them at least twice during the authorization process to check the known sequences of variants and explain any challenges with their primer and probe sets that we have with those variants that are in the database. In addition the FDA has bioinformatics capability. We have the list of all EUA authorized primers and probes for molecular assays. And we have been interrogating the sequence databases to see if there are any mutations that could impact test performance. We have done this for the UK variant. We have done this for the South African variant. And we have done this prior to these variants for any variant that's seen in the database that was at 5% of the sequences in the database or above. In all cases we reach out to the test developers. We ask for their assessment of the impact of these mutations on the performance of the test. We do our own evaluation of what we anticipate might be a significant potential performance alteration. And work with the developers to assess the potential impact.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Sequencing for variants, Molecular test adjustment, UK and South African mutations
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-5
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What actions does the FDA recommend if an S gene dropout is detected in molecular assays?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends sequence verification of S gene dropout samples. Access sequencing through Illumina's EUA authorized assay, state/local public health labs, or the CDC for public health labs following their procedures.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What actions does the FDA recommend if an S gene dropout is detected in molecular assays?
VERBATIM ANSWER: For the time being at least sequence verification of S gene dropout samples is something that we would recommend. Hopefully you have access to sequencing. As I mentioned there is an EUA authorized sequencing assay from Illumina that can suit this purpose. Also you can reach out to your state and local public health labs and they may or may not have a sequence capability. Some of them do and/or they can guide you in what is the best process to assess this. If you're a public health lab the CDC has asked that those isolates, those samples be sent to the CDC for sequencing. And so follow the CDC procedures and, you know, I would refer the public health labs to the CDC for any further questions on that.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: S gene dropout, FDA recommendations, Sequencing verification
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-6
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How can test developers access resources for sequencing verification of variants such as the Illumina assay?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Test developers can use the EUA-authorized Illumina sequencing assay, contact state or local public health labs for guidance, or send samples to the CDC following its procedures.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How can test developers access resources for sequencing verification of variants such as the Illumina assay?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Hopefully you have access to sequencing. As I mentioned there is an EUA authorized sequencing assay from Illumina that can suit this purpose. Also you can reach out to your state and local public health labs and they may or may not have a sequence capability.

TOPICS: Sequencing assay resources, Variant verification, CDC procedures
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-7
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the FDA's recommendations for single-gene target assays to address potential variant impacts?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends considering the possible impact of mutations on single-gene target assay performance, as these assays are more vulnerable compared to multi-gene assays. Multi-gene assays are generally less affected by mutations during the pandemic.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the FDA's recommendations for single-gene target assays to address potential variant impacts?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Obviously there are assay design issues that could be impacted by mutations particularly if an assay is a single gene target assay. And there are a number of single gene target assays that we have authorized. So it goes without saying that multi-gene assays are going to be less impacted by mutations as they continue to propagate in this pandemic. And will have an advantage over single gene target assays. Some technologies don't lend themselves well to multi-gene targets. We understand that completely. There's nothing wrong with the single gene assay. However there is a little bit more pressing need to understand, you know, how variants might impact performance with single gene assays.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Single-gene assays, Variant impacts, Assay design
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-8
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How should antigen test developers prepare for CDC testing of their kits against variants like the UK variant?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA stated that CDC will test EUA-authorized antigen tests against the UK variant and will request test developers to send 75 to 100 kits for evaluation.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How should antigen test developers prepare for CDC testing of their kits against variants like the UK variant?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The CDC has graciously agreed at least for the UK variants which they are now culturing to test the EUA authorized antigen tests at the CDC for their ability to detect the UK variant. So we will be reaching out to all of the EUA authorized antigen tests and asking them to send their kits. I think we need to be looking at 75 to 100 test's worth to send to the CDC because they do multiple levels and multiple replicates even for just a single variant such as the UK variant.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: antigen tests, UK variant, CDC testing
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-9
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What steps are needed to evaluate the impact of variants on serology tests if immune serum or plasma becomes available?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA needs immune plasma or serum from variant-specific patients to assess the impact of variants on serology tests. Requests have already been made for such samples, and assessments will proceed if variants become more prevalent.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What steps are needed to evaluate the impact of variants on serology tests if immune serum or plasma becomes available?
VERBATIM ANSWER: And finally I did want not mention serology tests. Obviously they can be impacted as well. And we will need to await the availability of immune serum or plasma from certain variant patients in order to assess the impact on serology. We have put requests out already for such samples. Obviously and thankfully at the moment there aren't that many in the U.S. of the UK variant and the South African variant. But if they do become more prevalent we expect to be able to access immune plasma or serum to assess performance in serology tests.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: impact of variants on serology tests, immune serum or plasma availability, test evaluation steps
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-10
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How should test developers respond to FDA requests for performance assessments regarding primers, probes, or other test components in light of emerging variants?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Test developers should assess the impact of variants on their test performance when contacted by FDA and collaborate in evaluating potential performance issues. The FDA will share relevant information with the community when significant conclusions are reached.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How should test developers respond to FDA requests for performance assessments regarding primers, probes, or other test components in light of emerging variants?
VERBATIM ANSWER: In all cases we reach out to the test developers. We ask for their assessment of the impact of these mutations on the performance of the test. We do our own evaluation of what we anticipate might be a significant potential performance alteration. And work with the developers to assess the potential impact. As soon as all that work has reached a point where we feel like it's important to share any information with the community we will.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE

REVIEW FLAG: True


#### 3. Guidance on Antigen Test Performance and Validation Criteria

QA Block 3-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What CT cutoff would be appropriate for reporting purposes and would it correlate with infectivity?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA does not use a CT cutoff or infectivity threshold as CT values vary widely. Rapid antigen tests have shown CTs up to 40 within the first five days of symptoms. The performance of antigen tests is primarily assessed within the first five to seven days of symptom onset.
VERBATIM QUESTION: For reporting purposes what CT cutoff would be appropriate and would it correlate with infectivity?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Okay. So what we ask is that you use the EUA authorized comparator test as its developed and that you report all results to us in alignment. We are not using a CT cutoff or some sort of infectivity cutoff because in fact CTs vary widely. For rapid antigen tests we have seen CTs as high as 40, four zero, in the first five days of symptoms. And exactly why that happens, don't know yet. But we very clearly see a healthy or an unhealthy number of high CT results in the first five to seven days of symptoms. And so we feel it's important that when someone has symptoms that we know the true performance of the antigen test. Now we do recommend that direct antigen tests - that their inclusion and exclusion criteria for their clinical study appropriately. We don't really expect the antigen tests are going to perform well after five to seven days depending on the test. Some tests do a little bit better than that. The bulk of tests have been authorized in the five to seven-day symptomatic period. And we want to understand symptomatic people who are confirmed positive to be SARS positive, you know, what is the detection rate of those people with the antigen test.

REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 3-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: For clinical validation as a screening test, what is the recommended minimum number of positive and negative PCR cases?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: For clinical validation as a screening test, at least 30 positives are generally required for an asymptomatic claim in a first study. For some pathways, a minimum of 10 positive cases may be acceptable. Equal numbers of negatives should also be included.
VERBATIM QUESTION: For clinical validation as a screening test, what is the recommended minimum number of positive and negative PCR cases?
VERBATIM ANSWER: If you're going for a screening claim -- an asymptomatic screening claim - and if you're doing it as your first and only study, then I believe you need 30 positives. If you're adding it there are a couple of different options for you whether you're adding it to an already authorized test or you are doing it in line with seeking your first EUA authorization. We have a minimum I believe depending on the pathway at 10 positive asymptomatic patients premarket or pre-authorization. If you're doing this with an antigen test I would recommend that you perform a study that will maximize our understanding of your true performance in the asymptomatic population that makes sense. So as I said antigen tests are at their peak performance in the first five to seven days of symptoms. Virus peaks - virus levels and shedding peak in that - typically peak in that window. And it may be, you know, earlier on in that window than later on in that window. We really, you know, know that after a week of somebody shedding the virus that antigen test performance will fall. And, you know, whereas a molecular test may be very - a good molecular test may be, you know, quite positive after 14 days. But, you know, well beyond perhaps the days of symptomatology if someone would be having symptoms. So sort of the best study design that will give you the best chance for showing excellent performance with an antigen test will be to link up with one of the serial testing programs. There's many on college campuses, maybe in workplaces, maybe in schools. And, you know, screening at a minimum say of every week with a molecular comparator that can be used for the comparator of record for your asymptomatic study. And you can enrich, you know, so you can wait until somebody identifies positives with that screening program. You can contact the individuals and see if they're willing to test with your test. And then we'll also want you to throw in an equal number at least of negatives to keep everybody honest. So that's probably the best way to enrich for asymptomatic at levels of virus level that we expect to see the antigen tests perform well in. I'll pause there in case you have any questions about that study design.

QA Block 3-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What factors should be considered when determining inclusion and exclusion criteria for clinical studies of rapid antigen tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends designing clinical studies for rapid antigen tests with inclusion and exclusion criteria that focus on the first five to seven days of symptoms when antigen tests perform best, while acknowledging variability in CT values.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What factors should be considered when determining inclusion and exclusion criteria for clinical studies of rapid antigen tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We are not using a CT cutoff or some sort of infectivity cutoff because in fact CTs vary widely. For rapid antigen tests we have seen CTs as high as 40, four zero, in the first five days of symptoms. And exactly why that happens, don't know yet.

QA Block 3-5
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Why does the performance of antigen tests decrease after five to seven days of symptoms?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The performance of antigen tests decreases after five to seven days because virus levels and shedding typically peak within this window. After a week, virus shedding decreases, leading to reduced detection by antigen tests.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Why does the performance of antigen tests decrease after five to seven days of symptoms?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We don't really expect the antigen tests are going to perform well after five to seven days depending on the test. Some tests do a little bit better than that.

QA Block 3-6
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What strategies can be used to optimize the design of a clinical study for asymptomatic screening claims?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: To optimize the design of a clinical study for asymptomatic screening claims, FDA recommends gathering at least 10 to 30 positive cases depending on the authorization pathway. Antigen test performance peaks in the first 5-7 days of symptoms, so it is suggested to collaborate with serial testing programs, such as at colleges or workplaces, to identify asymptomatic positives efficiently. Equal numbers of positive and negative cases should be included to balance the study.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What strategies can be used to optimize the design of a clinical study for asymptomatic screening claims?
VERBATIM ANSWER: If you're going for a screening claim -- an asymptomatic screening claim - and if you're doing it as your first and only study, then I believe you need 30 positives. If you're adding it there are a couple of different options for you whether you're adding it to an already authorized test or you are doing it in line with seeking your first EUA authorization.

QA Block 3-7
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How can serial screening programs facilitate the enrichment of asymptomatic samples for antigen test validation?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Serial screening programs, such as those in colleges or workplaces, can facilitate antigen test validation by identifying positive cases with molecular testing. Participants can then be contacted to test with the antigen test, while including a comparable number of negative cases to ensure accurate evaluation of test performance.

#### 4. FDA Guidance on Serology Testing and Vaccination

QA Block 4-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Could you clarify the priority of different COVID-19 diagnostic tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA prioritizes point-of-care tests, home tests, and in-home collection diagnostics, specifically molecular and antigen tests, followed by serology tests in those categories. High-throughput central lab testing on automated systems is also prioritized to reduce test result turnaround times.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Could you clarify the priority of different COVID-19 diagnostic tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Oh yes just briefly. Point of care tests, home tests, in-home collection are primarily focused on diagnostic tests. So those would be molecular and antigen tests. But we will also make serology tests in these categories a priority. And then high throughput central lab testing that can really help drive down turnaround times for test results. These are usually on automated platforms or automated systems and those are the priorities.

TOPICS: COVID-19 diagnostic test priority, Molecular and antigen tests, Central lab testing
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 4-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the FDA's guidance on the use of serology tests in vaccinated individuals with COVID-19 infection?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA has not authorized serology tests for use in vaccinated individuals to assess vaccine effects, immunity, or need. Existing serology tests should be used cautiously and not to determine immunity. Developers may submit clinical study designs for potential authorization, but such studies are likely large and complex.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the FDA's guidance on the use of serology tests in vaccinated individuals with COVID-19 infection?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Well first of all vaccines are reviewed by a different center. They are reviewed by CBER - C-B-E-R. And I would refer any questions you might have to them as well. The data needed to show that serology can be predictive in any way would be important for us to be able to review for any submission related to vaccine. There is no prohibition in any of the serology tests that we've authorized for use by clinicians to try to assess them. But we do always urge caution because we have not authorized any serology tests for use with vaccines for any purpose either to determine whether a vaccine is needed or determine if a vaccine has taken effect and provides any sort of immunity. In fact we haven't even authorized the serology tests around an immunity claim. We have authorized semi-quant serology tests and a neutralizing antibody serology test. Those perhaps could be more useful in assessing at least the question of immunity not necessarily that anybody can use them right now to declare immunity. That would be something that I think would be a bit dangerous right now.

TOPICS: Serology tests in vaccinated individuals, FDA authorization and guidance, Use of tests to assess immunity
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 4-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How do serology tests perform in individuals immunized with vaccines for COVID-19, especially regarding false positives?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA has not authorized serology tests for assessing performance in vaccinated individuals or for determining false positives. Authorization would require extensive studies, and the FDA is open to evaluating study proposals from developers.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How do serology tests perform in individuals immunized with vaccines for COVID-19, especially regarding false positives?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We have not authorized the test for that. To get authorized for that purpose to allow marketing would require, you know, a potentially significant study, you know, in conjunction with the vaccine study or trial. So we're open to developers who want to pursue this. We would ask that you draft a clinical study plan and send it to us and we would assess its ability to answer the question and allow an authorization. I do believe these are going to be very significantly large studies. And, you know, it's a bit dangerous for the FDA to say oh you've developed antibodies and the vaccine and now this is what it means you know? And so developing antibodies to a vaccine is potentially very similar to developing antibodies to the actual SARS infection. So, you know, but if someone who wants to pursue, a developer wants to pursue specific claims we're open to looking at the design. We would review this in conjunction of course with CBER.

SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: serology tests, vaccines, false positives
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 4-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can a serology test determine if someone has developed antibodies after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA has not authorized any serology tests to determine antibody development after vaccination. Any authorization for this purpose would require significant clinical studies. FDA is open to reviewing proposals in collaboration with CBER.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can a serology test determine if someone has developed antibodies after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We have not authorized the test for that. To get authorized for that purpose to allow marketing would require, you know, a potentially significant study, you know, in conjunction with the vaccine study or trial. So we're open to developers who want to pursue this. We would ask that you draft a clinical study plan and send it to us and we would assess its ability to answer the question and allow an authorization. I do believe these are going to be very significantly large studies. And, you know, it's a bit dangerous for the FDA to say oh you've developed antibodies and the vaccine and now this is what it means you know? And so developing antibodies to a vaccine is potentially very similar to developing antibodies to the actual SARS infection. So, you know, but if someone who wants to pursue, a developer wants to pursue specific claims we're open to looking at the design. We would review this in conjunction of course with CBER.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What kind of data is needed to show that serology tests can be predictive in vaccinated individuals?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA advises that data would need to show how serology tests can be predictive in vaccinated individuals, but no serology tests are currently authorized for assessing vaccine impact or immunity. Semi-quantitative and neutralizing antibody tests could potentially help with immunity questions; FDA urges caution in interpreting such results.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What kind of data is needed to show that serology tests can be predictive in vaccinated individuals?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The data needed to show that serology can be predictive in any way would be important for us to be able to review for any submission related to vaccine. There is no prohibition in any of the serology tests that we've authorized for use by clinicians to try to assess them. But we do always urge caution because we have not authorized any serology tests for use with vaccines for any purpose either to determine whether a vaccine is needed or determine if a vaccine has taken effect and provides any sort of immunity. In fact we haven't even authorized the serology tests around an immunity claim. We have authorized semi-quant serology tests and a neutralizing antibody serology test. Those perhaps could be more useful in assessing at least the question of immunity not necessarily that anybody can use them right now to declare immunity.

#### 5. Guidance on Controls and Screening for Antigen Tests

QA Block 5-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is there a guidance document or recommendation on how to approach controls for antigen tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends the use of endogenous controls for quality assessment but does not require them for EUA. For unobserved home collection samples, controls are critical to ensure self-collected sample quality. FDA reviews test performance even without controls but requires data for new home collection devices.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is there a guidance document or recommendation on how to approach controls for antigen tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: You know I mean it's obviously nice to have controls especially endogenous control that could assess the quality of the sample. But it's not a requirement for EUA authorization. We will assess test performance without such. The only requirement regarding such controls or the only recommendation for controls has been to date with unobserved home collection samples. Where we just have no idea if a patient has self-collected a sample well enough for performance in an assay that doesn't have endogenous controls. We have updated authorizations for some developers after they had already launched with an endogenous control and assessed performance in their home test looking at literally thousands of data points and have been able to back off on the requirement for endogenous controls in some cases. But for right now for a new developer with a new home collection we would like to see that data.

#### 6. Evaluating Enrichment Strategies for Rapid Antigen COVID Testing

QA Block 6-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are acceptable enrichment strategies for a rapid antigen test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA acknowledges that enrichment strategies for a rapid antigen test may include asymptomatic population testing with serial testing to improve test performance. However, for symptomatic populations, enrichment is generally unnecessary due to high positivity rates, and such study designs are not recommended.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are acceptable enrichment strategies for a rapid antigen test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. Well we might be amenable to that. I would send in, you know, a pre-EUA requesting the input on that. I don't think it's a particularly good study design. I'm just being honest. I mean the positivity rates out there are sky high. And, you know, you don't have to run a lot of tests in the clinics that's seeing patients with symptoms to get your minimum 30 positives. And yes you'll have, you know, a number of negatives. But unfortunately the virus is running pretty hot out there right now. And that kind of enrichment I don't believe is needed and there are some challenges. We have expressed flexibility for enrichment around asymptomatic testing just because to do this well for an antigen test I believe it should be a population that is serially tested as they'll give the antigen test the best opportunity to show its excellent performance in the first five to seven days of shedding a virus. But for those that have symptoms the virus is just, you know, hot out there. But if you really want to pursue that send in a request for a study review and a pre-EUA and we'll look at it.

#### 7. Evaluating Antigen Tests for UK Variant Reactivity

QA Block 7-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Would the CDC's testing for existing EUA tests be available for developers in the process of developing an antigen test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The CDC testing for EUA tests could be available for developers after assays are locked down. Developers may use alternative measures, such as pseudo virus constructs, for early assessments. The FDA suggests reaching out after assay development to evaluate test reactivity for the UK variant.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Would the CDC's testing for existing EUA tests be available for developers in the process of developing an antigen test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So, you know, I think that there is the right timing to do that. It would probably be after the assays have locked down. There may eventually be live virus of the UK variant positive in BEI bank and/or irradiated or heme activated virus. There also are pseudo virus constructs you can make to assess on your own. But I think we don't necessarily want to inundate the CDC in early stage of development. We're hoping that none of the antigen tests are impacted but it is important. And we'll get a good idea I think with the first tests we look at. Frequently it's the N gene that's targeted by antigen tests. And that probably is a bit more conserved in some respect than the spec protein, okay? But once you've locked it down and you're going to come in with submission I would reach out and check the status of this situation because I think, you know, it's probably going to be beneficial for us to, you know, at this moment I would say it would be beneficial for us to know what the reactivity is of a developed test that's being evaluated through FDA for the UK variant.

There may eventually be live virus of the UK variant positive in BEI bank and/or irradiated or heme activated virus. There also are pseudo virus constructs you can make to assess on your own. But I think we don't necessarily want to inundate the CDC in early stage of development. We're hoping that none of the antigen tests are impacted but it is important. And we'll get a good idea I think with the first tests we look at. Frequently it's the N gene that's targeted by antigen tests. And that probably is a bit more conserved in some respect than the spec protein, okay? But once you've locked it down and you're going to come in with submission I would reach out and check the status of this situation because I think, you know, it's probably going to be beneficial for us to, you know, at this moment I would say it would be beneficial for us to know what the reactivity is of a developed test that's being evaluated through FDA for the UK variant. We each want to time that correctly in your development process.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Would a validation study appropriate for EUAs also be applicable for a 510k clearance?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Yes, a validation study appropriate for an EUA may also apply to a 510k clearance. FDA focuses on differences for SARS-related tests and recommends looking at recent decision summaries. They are drafting guidance for transitions between EUA and 510k.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Would a validation study appropriate for EUAs also be applicable for a 510k clearance?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Oh yes. Yes, so, yes let me just talk about the transition a little bit from EUA to 510ks or de novos if you're the first one in. And this applies to anything SARS related. And even for, like, some categories, like, molecular they'll be at the bare minimum. A single target SARS - a single virus assay, like, SARS only category. And then there will be a panel category. Those each would be separate de novo submissions. Once a de novo is authorized within one of the categories every follow on assay will be a 510k submission. For those developers who want to know about what is required for the - what is recommended for the conversion we are working on a guidance document that would be a draft at first. But it may not go into enough detail across the board for all EUA type products. And so I have asked our team to draft some information that we can share with developers. Primarily it's going to be what is different about SARS from a standard say antigen in infectious disease, in a respiratory infectious antigen serology and/or molecular test. So our feedback is going to be focused on what's different because we're just swamped with work and submissions. And so we want to focus on the things that are truly different about SARS and our responses. And then for, you know, the more common, factors for any of these categories of tests, you know, we would urge you to look at our recent decision summaries for de novos and 510ks including any special controls for all the sort of commonly asked questions about a respiratory virus test. But we'll focus on the things that are different. The other thing is there is - I do not perceive a need to rush to converting EUA. We still have so many EUA applications to process. And we get so many new ones every week. It's really, you know, an unprecedented volume and continued volume. And so our focus is really going to be primarily on getting the EUAs authorized. And, you know, until the emergency ends which I don't perceive this happening anytime soon, EUA submissions are going to be allowed, EUA tests are going to be allowed. And even if it were to end at some point we're drafting guidance that will allow a very reasonable transition timepoint, a timeline so that there will not be something that we believe is unreasonable insofar as time goes to convert these. But I do understand that, you know, we are going to ask more for conversion. And it probably is wise for all developers to start thinking about those conversions. And it leads to collecting the samples now when SARS is prevalent to be able to do those conversion studies if that's interesting and important to you to convert at the point where it's important to convert.

What I will say is that as soon as we have confirmed the potential impacts on a test whether it be molecular, antigen or serology, we will endeavor to make that information public as soon as possible. So certainly the primers and probes sequences for the CDC assay are published and people can look at, you know, mutations and see how they might affect those primers and probes.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA have any recommendations regarding the use of endogenous or exogenous controls for antigen tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: You know I mean it's obviously nice to have controls especially endogenous control that could assess the quality of the sample. But it's not a requirement for EUA authorization. We will assess test performance without such. The only requirement regarding such controls or the only recommendation for controls has been to date with unobserved home collection samples. Where we just have no idea if a patient has self-collected a sample well enough for performance in an assay that doesn't have endogenous controls. We have updated authorizations for some developers after they had already launched with an endogenous control and assessed performance in their home test looking at literally thousands of data points and have been able to back off on the requirement for endogenous controls in some cases.
