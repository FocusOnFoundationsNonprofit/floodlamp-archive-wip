#### 2. Factors Affecting EUA Approval Timelines

QA Block 2-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are some of the circumstances that might allow one company to receive EUA approval after six weeks versus other companies that have been waiting for over 100 days?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA uses a triage system to prioritize EUA submissions based on factors such as completeness of the submission, importance to national response (e.g., home tests, point-of-care tests, high-throughput testing), and compliance with required data submission. Developers are encouraged to ensure submissions are complete and communicate with FDA to clarify triage status.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are some of the circumstances that might allow one company to receive EUA approval after six weeks versus other companies that have been waiting for over 100 days?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So we do have a triage system Adam. If you think that triage system I mean or you think you're - where you are in the triage is not appropriate for your developed test, if you haven't already done so please communicate with us. I know we have our - some sponsor specific, developer specific conversations going on. And we'll continue those to make sure that they're properly triaged. And we clearly have stated recently that those EUAs submissions that require EUA authorization before they can be implemented like any sort of home collection, home tests of course, point-of-care tests, they can't be point-of- care unless we've reviewed and authorized and deemed it as point-of-care and then in addition those things that substantially add to the ability for our national response in terms of throughput, high throughput testing. The other thing is, you know, those submissions that are incomplete may not be triaged higher on the list. So every submission in my direction has a contact within two weeks in the office. So if you want to check that your submission is complete you can ask that contact. You can also ask that contact to double check your triage status and make sure that they understand the features of your tests and how it might be a higher priority. But, you know, from the beginning we've received over 2400 applications, EUA applications as of last month. We've authorized going on 300 tests. We've authorized over 200 amendments to EUA authorized tests and we've denied something on the order of 100 tests. So we are making decisions as soon as we can. Those who have serology tests that are amendable for testing at NCI we are encouraging all developers to submit their tests to NCI. And we are - there is still a backlog although of those that we've prioritized at NCI, the backlog is shrinking and then once we get data from NCI we try to make our decision as quickly as possible. And obviously we share the NCI data with - that we receive with the sponsor so hopefully that helps.

#### 5. FDA Guidance on Laboratory Developed Test EUAs

QA Block 5-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are laboratories required to submit their EUA applications within 15 days of validation if those applications are not going to be reviewed?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA guidance documents are nonbinding, and while prior recommendations suggested submitting EUA applications within 15 days of validation, current FAQs take precedence, especially considering that FDA is not prioritizing LDT reviews and HHS has stated no premarket review is required.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are laboratories required to submit their EUA applications within 15 days of validation if those applications are not going to be reviewed?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So the guidance document I believe is what you're referring to. That was issued well before the HHS statement. And the FAQ that you're referring to. And, you know, as I'm sure you're aware, guidance documents are nonbinding. So the recommendations in the guidance were our recommendations at the time that that was issued. And we, you know, as we've now said that we would, that we're generally not prioritizing review of LDTs and HHS has said that FDA will not require premarket review of LDTs the, you know, the current FAQ is, I would say, more current than the portion of the guidance the you're referring to.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Kimberly Zunker
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: EUA application timelines, Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs), FDA guidance vs FAQ
REVIEW FLAG: True
NOTES: The QA block addresses a real point of confusion: the original FDA guidance recommended submitting EUA applications within 15 days, but newer FAQs—and the HHS statement—suggest that LDT reviews are not currently being prioritized and premarket review is not required. Because Toby Lowe explicitly indicates that FDA is “working on some additional clarification” and acknowledges a discrepancy between “existing guidance and the FAQs,” _there is an inherent uncertainty in the final, official position._

QA Block 5-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the FDA's stance on the binding nature of guidance documents versus FAQs?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA considers guidance documents nonbinding, representing recommendations at the time of issuance. Current FAQs are more relevant than earlier guidance regarding LDTs and premarket reviews.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the FDA's stance on the binding nature of guidance documents versus FAQs?
VERBATIM ANSWER: And, you know, as I'm sure you're aware, guidance documents are nonbinding. So the recommendations in the guidance were our recommendations at the time that that was issued. And we, you know, as we've now said that we would, that we're generally not prioritizing review of LDTs and HHS has said that FDA will not require premarket review of LDTs the, you know, the current FAQ is, I would say, more current than the portion of the guidance the you're referring to.

#### 6. New Submissions for High-Throughput EUA Modifications

QA Block 6-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: If you have an existing EUA for a high-throughput capacity test and want to add new analytes, are you recommending an amendment to the existing EUA or is a new submission required?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends a new submission for adding new analytes to an existing EUA for high-throughput capacity tests, as it allows maintaining separate records of validation and ensuring SARS is not impacted.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If you have an existing EUA for a high-throughput capacity test and want to add new analytes, are you recommending an amendment to the existing EUA or is a new submission required?
VERBATIM ANSWER: That typically would be a new submission, a new test and not an update, unless you're going to sunset the other test, but even so it's probably for our records best to keep that as a separate submission. And we've provided some pretty good recommendation in our molecular template for that. I believe also the - we've authorized the first antigen, undirect antigen test with the panel. But I don't know that our current template is updated for our panel test that's obviously in the works as well to provide updated recommendation. But if you have a direct antigen test and you want to move to a panel for those listening, just approach us and ask us for our current recommendations on how to do that. So yes so the short answer is I think that's best handled by a new submission and new assay and a new record of validation because even for SARS we would want to make sure that SARS is not impacted by the additional panel members that analyze that you're adding.

#### 8. FDA Position on Off-Label Antigen Testing for Screening

QA Block 8-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the FDA have an updated position on the off-label use of antigen testing for asymptomatic screening?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA acknowledges mixed data on off-label use of antigen tests for asymptomatic screening and cannot provide blanket recommendations due to uncertainties. Developers seeking claims for screening must submit supporting data, with several pathways available for authorization. Off-label use is permissible when prescribed by clinicians.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA have an updated position on the off-label use of antigen testing for asymptomatic screening?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, the data we've received -- and I can't go into all of it because much of it is confidential -- is mixed. Some studies seem to say that the viral levels at least as determined by cycle thresholds which is an imperfect way of determining virus thresholds or virus levels are similar in some cases and others very different. And we don't understand why that is. So and when they're different the asymptomatic population usually has a lower viral load than the symptomatic population. And that could be from a variety of reasons as well. And we make decisions based on data and since it's - since the data are unclear, the science is unclear now, it's difficult to sort of say make blanket recommendations about this. So we have asked developers if they want a claim for screening, specifically asymptomatic patients that they come in with data. We've given them large number of options for doing that and we've offered - obviously authorized some already and we're very interested in authorizing others. You know, and typically, you know, we ask for a small number of patients who are known to be asymptomatic and do a comparison study from the test that's being submitted with another high sensitivity EUA authorized test and then there's also the ability to use bank samples. There's also the ability to look at for where it's applicable to historical data where you have data from both types of patients and it shows comparable cycle thresholds. I'm trying to think of the other ways that we've been allowing a claim. But we very clearly as stated in our FAQs and other communications that most of the IUs that we - writing in the IU and the instructions for use, indications for use, we've clearly stated those suspected of COVID-19. And that can be people who have symptoms but it can also be some - many patients who are without symptoms but… are known to have an exposure where you want to make sure they don't - they are carrying the virus.

QA Block 8-6
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the FDA guidance on off-label test use for asymptomatic patients include specific recommendations for handling false positives in low-incidence populations?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends a secondary orthogonal test to confirm positive results in low-incidence populations, as false positives are more likely due to test specificity limits.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA guidance on off-label test use for asymptomatic patients include specific recommendations for handling false positives in low-incidence populations?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The specific issue that I know was seen in Nevada and many other nursing homes recently and certainly whenever there's a complaint about say a false positive, we look at those complaints and we do an investigation as required and determine whether or not there's a device issue. Then the challenge is that in those populations it doesn't even matter what particular test, whether it's authorized for asymptomatic testing or not, no test is perfect, no test is 100% specific. And so if you have - and that includes molecular tests by the way. Those are not 100% specific. They may be very high, maybe even higher than direct antigen tests but they're not 100% specific. That's sort of impossible to reach. And so when you have a very low incident population of positive results the chance of having a false positive is very high. And therefore if it matters whether that's a true positive or not whether it's in somebody who's staffing the nursing home or it's a healthcare worker in another environment or it's an actual patient that you're interested in knowing when the population you're looking at is very low incident you want to double check that result. So I would send it off for a different orthogonal test. This is very clearly stated in the current CDC FAQs and our guidance and it applies not to just to direct antigen tests but also to all tests.

QA Block 8-9
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How does population incidence affect the reliability of a test, especially in terms of false positives?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: In low-incidence populations, the likelihood of false positives increases even with high-specificity tests. For example, a 99% specificity means one in 100 negatives will be false positives, which can outnumber true positives in very low-incidence populations. FDA recommends confirmatory tests in such cases.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How does population incidence affect the reliability of a test, especially in terms of false positives?
VERBATIM ANSWER: When you have a very low incident population of positive results the chance of having a false positive is very high. And therefore if it matters whether that's a true positive or not whether it's in somebody who's staffing the nursing home or it's a healthcare worker in another environment or it's an actual patient that you're interested in knowing when the population you're looking at is very low incident you want to double check that result. So I would send it off for a different orthogonal test. This is very clearly stated in the current CDC FAQs and our guidance and it applies not to just to direct antigen tests but also to all tests. And just to go back and just talk about this a little bit, so if you have a test that is 99% specific that is a fixed number. It doesn't matter what the incidence is in the population. It means on average one out of every 100 negative patients will test positive with that test. And I think most people would agree that a 99% specific test is pretty high. So, if you suddenly have a population that has significantly less than 1% incidence of true positive results it means that there will be more false positives than true positives.

#### 9. Regulatory Pathways for Marketing VTM Collection Kits

QA Block 9-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the options for a company that wishes to market viral transport media (VTM)?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA confirms that marketing viral transport media (VTM) during a public health emergency follows an immediately-in-effect guidance. Generally, swabs are Class 1 exempt but transport media requires a 510k unless using the enforcement discretion policy. This policy is not limited to SARS-CoV-2 and applies broadly.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the options for a company that wishes to market viral transport media (VTM)?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So yes you - what you've outlined sounds pretty much correct. The - so what - when you're saying that there's a, you know, EUA for saliva collection devices we don't actually have a template specific to saliva collection devices. We have authorized EUAs for two, I believe saliva collection devices at this point. Those are standalone collection devices. They are not home collection kits. We have also authorized several home collection kits that include there are some that are saliva and some that are nasal swabs. And for VTM separately we do have the immediately in effect guidance. So many swabs are Class 1 exempt if it's just the swab and the transport media is what bumps it up to needing the 510k. So generally those do need 510k and we are not generally looking at EUAs for transport media specifically because we do have the - this guidance document out with the policy that allows for enforcement discretion for the 510k's that are required for that transport media. So if you want to use and to so to market transport media during the public health emergency you can take a look at that policy and the guidance and that is not limited to SARS CoV-2 testing. That is for the distribution of transport media during the public health emergency but it is for more broad testing for molecular testing I believe.

VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the key performance requirements for authorizing a home test under an EUA?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes so there's, you know, there's the three main things that we look for. So let me just, you know, at a high level say absolutely we're totally supportive of authorizing home tests and home direct antigen tests.

I've looked at various developers for SARS tests in both these categories that you have talked about. And it doesn't really matter the readout method as long as it can be clearly understood by the home user and then the results clearly interpreted…and they read the test as being positive negative or didn't work invalid. And then do they know what the results of that test means, you know, positive what does that mean, if negative what does it mean, if invalid what does it mean. And that the performance is such that we're now missing more than overall in whatever scheme you use you could have two tests that they use, day one, day two, day one day three, that we are able to detect the vast majority of home users that are have - are shedding virus that could potentially infect others. I usually talk about the first five to seven days of shedding of virus in a newly infected patient. That may overlap symptoms or not. It doesn't really matter. That's what we're looking for. We want to see - we don't want to miss we don't want to miss 50% or more clearly of people who could transmit the virus to somebody else. And we've set the bar at 80% I think that's pretty good. It's still means that we could be missing 20% of patients who could infect others. And going lower than that seems not the right thing to do. So but we will work with developers if they have different schemes so basically serial testing schemes are amenable if they're successful in getting that sensitivity PPA to a level that consumers and others can have confidence in a result. If it's negative then it's most likely negative. If it's positive there most likely and positive.

VERBATIM ANSWER: And that the performance is such that we're now missing more than overall in whatever scheme you use you could have two tests that they use, day one, day two, day one day three, that we are able to detect the vast majority of home users that are have - are shedding virus that could potentially infect others. I usually talk about the first five to seven days of shedding of virus in a newly infected patient. That may overlap symptoms or not. It doesn't really matter. That's what we're looking for. We want to see - we don't want to miss we don't want to miss 50% or more clearly of people who could transmit the virus to somebody else. And we've set the bar at 80% I think that's pretty good. It's still means that we could be missing 20% of patients who could infect others. And going lower than that seems not the right thing to do. So but we will work with developers if they have different schemes so basically serial testing schemes are amenable if they're successful in getting that sensitivity PPA to a level that consumers and others can have confidence in a result. If it's negative then it's most likely negative. If it's positive there most likely and positive. That's really important okay?

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are there specific sensitivity thresholds that need to be met for home-based COVID-19 tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA supports authorizing home-based tests but sets an 80% sensitivity threshold to ensure early detection of contagious cases. Tests that miss 50% or more are unacceptable, and testing schemes like serial testing must ensure confidence in results.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are there specific sensitivity thresholds that need to be met for home-based COVID-19 tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes so there's, you know, there's the three main things that we look for. So let me just, you know, at a high level say absolutely we're totally supportive of authorizing home tests and home direct antigen tests. And in fact I've, you know, well I've noted on previous calls here that we haven't received a submission for a home test whether it be molecular or direct antigen where we can even review to authorize so that's why I continue to encourage it. I've also let our staff know that I would be very interested in authorizing a good home test as soon as possible. So they know when they see one if it's good that we want to do our best to get that authorized the soonest possible. I've looked at various developers for SARS tests in both these categories that you have talked about. And it doesn't really matter the readout method as long as it can be clearly understood by the home user and then the results clearly interpreted…and they read the test as being positive negative or didn't work invalid.

#### 12. FDA Standards for Prescription vs. Nonprescription Test Authorization

QA Block 12-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the FDA's considerations when comparing EUAs for tests requiring a physician prescription versus those that do not?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA considers the involvement of a clinician a mitigation of risk for prescription tests, allowing for a lower sensitivity threshold (80%). Nonprescription tests require a higher sensitivity threshold (90%) due to the user needing to independently choose, perform, and interpret the test without medical guidance. These factors are discussed in the home test template.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the FDA's considerations when comparing EUAs for tests requiring a physician prescription versus those that do not?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes so obviously under prescription well, you know, everything essentially, I don't think we've authorize the nonprescription test yet for an EUA. And the reason for that is we can lower the bar a little bit when a clinician is involved because that's a mitigation of risk. They - if they're involved then they can assess the clinical situation and assess whether a positive is sounds right or a negative sounds right and instead of a patient or a consumer being left entirely on their own and not having the relevant medical background to make an assessment. So when it's OTC we generally expect the bar to be a little bit higher. So for direct antigen test for example in an OTC where someone can just go to a drugstore and pick it up off the shelf, go to a cashier or self-check out, you know, go home and test and not have any interaction with a medical professional at all we expect that the PPA or sensitivity for such a device is 90% for like a direct antigen test. But if it's by prescription our bar of 80% is sufficient because that additional loss of sensitivity if a clinician's involved we know that they can assess the situation and get repeat testing if warranted. And this is also discussed in the home test template a little bit there is some discussion about prescription versus nonprescription because as Tim was saying, you know, it's important that for nonprescription test the user needs to be able to identify that that's the correct test for them to take. They need to be able to perform the test themselves and get the results and interpret the results themselves. So those are all factors that we look at.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: How is the information expected from developers different for prescription and nonprescription COVID-19 tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: For prescription tests, FDA permits a lower sensitivity threshold since clinicians can mitigate the risk by interpreting results and deciding on further steps. Nonprescription tests require higher sensitivity (e.g., 90% for OTC direct antigen tests) because users must independently handle and interpret results, making accuracy more critical.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: Dry swabs can be added as an approved sample type if the resuspension is validated. The FDA does not currently require a bridging study to wet swabs.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Do you consider dry or direct swabs as an approved sample type at this point?
VERBATIM ANSWER: I'm not sure I totally understand the question. So you can add dry swabs if you validate the resuspension. There are different ways to validate that resuspension obviously. But we are not requiring a bridging study to a wet swab for a dry swab.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Christie Bergerson
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: approval of dry swabs, validation of resuspension, bridging study requirements
REVIEW FLAG: False
