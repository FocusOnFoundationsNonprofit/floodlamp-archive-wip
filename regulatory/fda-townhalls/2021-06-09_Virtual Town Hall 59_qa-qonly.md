Due to the evolving nature of data regarding long COVID, FDA encourages developers to engage through pre-EUA processes to discuss specific technologies, claims, and validation approaches.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the FDA's stance on the development of tests for conditions related to long COVID?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Generally the tests that we have authorized so far are intended for use in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus as an aid in the diagnosis of infection with the virus. If you're developing an NGS test for that type of indication, we would want to engage with you through a pre-EUA since the NGS validation is a little more nuanced than some of the other test types. And we would prefer to discuss with you about your specific test and claims and technology. So we can work with you on a validation approach that's most appropriate. And in terms of a test specifically for long COVID, we are interested in learning more about the etiology and the reports of individuals who have been stricken with COVID-19 but don't recover fully over a period of weeks. And if you're developing a test to diagnose or monitor long COVID, we would also be interested in discussing that through a pre-EUA. The data and studies are still kind of in progress and data's being generated for these types of individuals. And if there are approaches that folks have for kind of predicting this or helping this kind of area then I think we're definitely interested in speaking with you in the pre-EUA.

QA Block 11-7
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How does the FDA assess whether a test with a resubmitted EUA becomes a priority for review?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA does not use a rigid first-in, first-out model for reviews. Revised submissions that include improvements to the test can increase priority, but overall prioritization depends on various factors evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
VERBATIM QUESTION: IMPLICIT
VERBATIM ANSWER: So, you know, the tests that are awaiting review are, you know, not necessarily in a sort of first in first out type of queue. So it's not necessarily that, you know, it's not like we're going to send you to the back of the line if you submit something to add to your submission. The - adding something to your submission would not, you know, like I said, it's not going to put you to the back of the line. If anything, if it's, you know, if there's something about what you add to your submission that like you said, improves the test or, you know, adds something that is considered to be a priority for FDA review then it would potentially bump your submission higher up on the queue. But, you know, generally there are a variety of factors that impact the, you know, where a test is in terms of priority for review. And so the details of each submission would be considered as we determine what is sort of next steps for review as reviewers become available.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: EUA review prioritization, Submission improvements
REVIEW FLAG: False

VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA have guidelines for an NGS test for long COVID?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The next question we have is regarding any guidelines that the FDA might have for an NGS test for long COVID. And so generally the tests that we have authorized so far are intended for use in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus as an aid in the diagnosis of infection with the virus. If you're developing an NGS test for that type of indication, we would want to engage with you through a pre-EUA since the NGS validation is a little more nuanced than some of the other test types. And we would prefer to discuss with you about your specific test and claims and technology. So we can work with you on a validation approach that's most appropriate. And in terms of a test specifically for long COVID, we are interested in learning more about the etiology and the reports of individuals who have been stricken with COVID-19 but don't recover fully over a period of weeks.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can manufacturers commercialize a molecular point of care COVID-19 device while the EUA is under review?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Manufacturers can commercialize a molecular point of care COVID-19 device if they follow the notification policies outlined in the FDA guidance, which requires notification of successful assay validation and submission of a completed EUA request within 15 business days. However, the notification policy is specific to high complexity CLIA-certified laboratories; it typically does not apply to point-of-care devices unless covered by a high complexity CLIA certificate.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can manufacturers commercialize a molecular point of care COVID-19 device while the EUA is under review?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So just to clarify, there are - this question appears to be referring to the notification policies that are included in the guidance document, the policy for Coronavirus Disease 2019 Test during the public health emergency. And that policy guidance document does include the notification policies that, you know, puts together a process for a manufacturer following completion of their assay validation to notify FDA that their assay has been validated and that they intend to begin distribution or use of the test. Generally, FDA would acknowledge receipt of the notification and add the name of the test developer and the test to our Web site listing. We do have a list of all notified tests on the FAQ pages. And, you know, in the guidance document it outlined a process for the test developer to submit a completed EUA request within 15 business days of the notification to FDA that the assay has been successfully validated. And if that's not done we generally removed the test from the Web site and may take additional action as appropriate. There are a couple of important things to note here. One is that submission of an EUA request is not the same as notifying under the policies in the guidance. A test developer that intends to use the notification policy must specifically notify per the process outlined in the guidance and should not assume that they're considered to be notified simply because they submitted an EUA request. And then another thing that I want to note is that this question specifically mentioned the point of care device. And the notification policy is specific to tests being used in high complexity CLIA-certified laboratories. Tests that are not yet authorized are - under CLIA, are limited to use in high complexity CLIA-certified laboratories. So that would generally not apply to point of care devices unless that point of care setting is - falls under a CLIA-certified laboratory - a high complexity CLIA-certified laboratory certificate.

#### 10. CLIA Waivers Transition Process and Future Categorization Insights

QA Block 10-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Do you have any preview on the cost side for CLIA waivers during or post-transition?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA cannot provide specific cost details for CLIA waivers during or post-transition as the guidance is still being developed. The transition guidance will allow for stakeholder comment before finalization. Tests authorized for point-of-care use during the emergency will not retain CLIA-waived status post-EUA and will need to undergo a normal submission process for permanent categorization.

But, you know, with that said, you know, you're correct that tests are deemed to be CLIA waived when they're authorized for use at the point of care during the emergency. That is not a CLIA categorization. It will not, you know, be in place after the EUA is terminated. So, you know, I would suspect that it will be, you know, somewhat of a normal process, you know, depending on whatever the transition plan is that's put into place, you know, to get that sort of permanent categorization. We would go through, you know, a similar process to what we normally go through for submissions.

VERBATIM ANSWER: Sure. Yes. I think it's likely going to be acceptable. You know, you're going to want to see some sort of bridging study if appropriate. You know, just established that the buffer, is you know, kind of behaving in a predictable manner. But I suspect that we would want to kind of see this written out a little bit more detailed because obviously the devil is always in the details. But I think, you know, on its face again, it seems acceptable.
