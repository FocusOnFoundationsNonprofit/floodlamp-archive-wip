#### 1. FDA Update on COVID-19 Test Authorizations and Validation Guidance

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Would FDA consider the use of contrived influenza specimens for an EUA submission with the expectation that a prospective clinical study would be conducted post-authorization?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA primarily recommends using archived clinical specimens, though developers facing challenges in obtaining them can discuss specific situations with the agency. Prospective studies with actual clinical specimens are generally expected.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Would FDA consider the use of contrived influenza specimens for an EUA submission with the expectation that a prospective clinical study would be conducted post-authorization?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We do know that there's been some concerns with the ability to obtain archived specimens. And if you are, you know, running into that roadblock, we encourage you to reach out to us to discuss your specific situations. But for the most part, we do continue to recommend the use of archived positive and negative clinical specimens rather than contrived. We know that, you know, they may be difficult to obtain, but that perspective testing is going to be with those, with actual clinical specimens is going to be generally what we expect for those types of studies.

REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 2-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are there challenges in accessing the BioFire as a predicate since it is the only de novo predicate for a SARS-CoV-2 test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recognizes challenges with using BioFire as the only de novo predicate for a future 510K. Test developers can use EUA authorized comparators for clinical studies, while BioFire remains the predicate for submission. Additional options like data from EUA-authorized tests and reference panel testing can support 510K submissions, but a prospective clinical study is strongly recommended.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are there challenges in accessing the BioFire as a predicate since it is the only de novo predicate for a SARS-CoV-2 test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We also briefly discussed just a little bit last week but there's a question about the BioFire being challenging to have access to as a predicate since it's the only de novo currently in the - the only predicate for a future 510K for a SARS-CoV-2 test. And we did talk last week that you can use an EUA authorized test as a comparator for your clinical studies even though BioFire would e your predicate for the submission itself. The question also was asking about whether there are other options such as testing to the reference panel to support a 510K. And while we do consider another EUA authorized comparator to the acceptable we do really want to see the perspective clinical study in your 510K submission. You can also include reference panel results and the clinicals that are from your authorized EUA if you have one and leverage those but they would not be, generally they would not be considered to be sufficient on their own to support a 510K clearance.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: BioFire access, Predicate challenges, 510K submissions
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 2-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can an EUA-authorized test be used as a comparator for clinical studies despite BioFire being the predicate for submission?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA considers an EUA-authorized test an acceptable comparator for clinical studies, even if BioFire is the predicate for the 510(k) submission. Prospective clinical studies are encouraged. Reference panel results and EUA clinical data can be included but are typically insufficient alone for clearance.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can an EUA-authorized test be used as a comparator for clinical studies despite BioFire being the predicate for submission?
VERBATIM ANSWER: And we did talk last week that you can use an EUA authorized test as a comparator for your clinical studies even though BioFire would be your predicate for the submission itself.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the FDA's expectation regarding a proposal for a serial testing plan and the post-authorization study in an EUA request?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA expects to see a proposal for a serial testing plan and a post-authorization study in the EUA request. FDA will discuss details, like the statistical plan, during the review process.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the FDA's expectation regarding a proposal for a serial testing plan and the post-authorization study in an EUA request?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Generally we would want to see your proposal for a serial testing plan and the post- FDA Webinar authorization study in your EUA request. And we would discuss that with you during the review particularly the statistical plan which is what this question is focused on. We would want to go through that with you in detail. So we can't really get into too many details on the specific book on this call because it will be specific to each individual test and each approach that you're looking to take as a test developer to validate your test.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: Serial testing plan, Post-authorization study, EUA request requirements
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 3-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What additional data does the FDA expect to see for serial screening using the supplemental template?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA generally does not expect additional validation data for asymptomatic serial screening if no other factors, such as patient population or usability, are changing. Requirements are reviewed case-by-case.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What additional data does the FDA expect to see for serial screening using the supplemental template?
VERBATIM ANSWER: And so, you know, the way that supplemental template is laid out is that it is there as an approach sot that if you have symptomatic validation data and you've been authorized for testing symptomatic individuals, that template allows you to expand your or to request expanding your claims to asymptomatic serial screening without doing that additional asymptomatic validation ahead of time. That would be the post-authorization condition. So generally, you know, for most cases as long as nothing else is changing, so you're not changing your patient population such as point of care to at home or other changes that might impact the usability. We would not expect to see additional validation clinical or usability as long as nothing is changing except for going from symptomatic to serial screening. And we could discuss that on a case-by-case basis if there are things that are changing whether there is additional data that we would need to see.

TOPICS: serial screening requirements, FDA supplemental template, asymptomatic claims
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 3-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What does the FDA recommend regarding moving a test from prescription to over-the-counter use?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends using the non-laboratory use template for OTC molecular and antigen tests. Tests moving to OTC should include an asymptomatic claim for screening, appropriate labeling, and usability for lay users. The supplemental template can support this transition.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What does the FDA recommend regarding moving a test from prescription to over-the-counter use?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We do have recommendations in the template for OTC use that's in the non-laboratory use template for molecular and antigen tests. The supplemental template that we've been talking about also can support this FDA Webinar move from prescription to over-the-counter because one of the requirements for over-the-counter is that there is an asymptomatic claim. We generally would not authorize a test for over-the-counter use if it does not have that broad asymptomatic screening claim since that's how we would expect it to be used over the counter. And so if you are able to use the supplemental template to get that asymptomatic claim, as long as everything else about your test is appropriate for over-the-counter use and has appropriate labeling, usability user comprehension for a lay user then we would be able to do that over-the-counter labeling for you as well in that same EUA request.

And so if you are able to use the supplemental template to get that asymptomatic claim, as long as everything else about your test is appropriate for over-the-counter use and has appropriate labeling, usability user comprehension for a lay user then we would be able to do that over-the-counter labeling for you as well in that same EUA request.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: From a regulatory perspective, pooled testing is considered a diagnostic test. While screening refers to testing asymptomatic individuals broadly, it is a subset of diagnostic testing.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is pooled testing considered a diagnostic or a screening test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: And that question was also asking about whether pooled testing is considered a diagnostic or a screening. And I do want to clarify that we, you know, we have talked a lot about diagnostic testing and screening testing. And we talk FDA Webinar about screening when we're talking about testing asymptomatic individuals that have no reason to suspect that they have COVID-19 and doing that broad screening to capture those asymptomatic individuals. But really a screening test is a subset of a diagnostic test. It is looking to get an individual result and to identify individuals who have SARS-CoV-2 present and has that, had COVID-19. So it is considered to be a diagnostic test from a regulatory perspective. We just generally refer to it as screening to be clear about the implication that we're talking about with the patient population.

VERBATIM ANSWER: We have accepted data from outside of the US for clinical studies. We generally for point of care want those studies to be done in the US because we have found some issues with making sure that point of care studies done outside the US are truly applicable to a US setting. So in that case we would want to see them done here, but for central lab tests, we would definitely be able to considering data from outside the US and we would be interested in talking to about that approach and how, you know, how it is applicable to a US population. You may also want to consider including in your submission some information on the prevalence rates in different, you know, where it was studied as well as the circulating variants.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: Antigen tests are not required to have a mobile app preauthorization, but a post-authorization plan for reporting to public health authorities is typically established within an agreed timeframe.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are antigen tests required to have a mobile app four months after EUA approval?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So the appreciate is something that we've included as a post-authorization condition for some of - for tests that did not have reporting capabilities generally. So this is, for the most part, related to having the ability to report results to public health authority. So for laboratories there is a requirement for labs to report results to public health authorities, that requirement does not exist for home tests. But obviously reporting to public health authorities is very important for monitoring the pandemic. So the mobile app is one way to enable that reporting from a home test to the public health authorities. So that's something that we have not required preauthorization as an authorization requirement for these at-home tests but we have worked with the developers to put a plan into place to get those, to get that reporting capability worked out within an agreed upon time frame after authorization.

VERBATIM QUESTION: When does the FDA decide not to reissue a letter of authorization despite making changes to an EUA?
VERBATIM ANSWER: There are certain changes that we can grant through what we refer to as a granting letter. And those are included on the EUA table as you look at a specific test. There's often a little plus sign next to the row and if you click that some of them will have other documents and those will be a letter granting an EUA amendment in many cases. And a lot of times those are for smaller changes like an update to the labeling that would not change the intended use in any way. We also sometimes update labeling for things like adding the reference panel results. And so those are some of the changes that would get updated on our website, but don't require a reissuance of the letter of authorization.

QA Block 14-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: If a home collection device is authorized under EUA, could it be expanded for use with other EUA authorized molecular assays without additional testing?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA would need to evaluate specific validation data to determine if a broad claim for a dried blood spot collection device could be supported or if the device needs test-specific validation.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If a home collection device is authorized under EUA, could it be expanded for use with other EUA authorized molecular assays without additional testing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: For dried blood spot, there are some assay-specific issues. So we would have to look at the specific validation and whether there, you know, is a broad claim that could be considered or whether it would need to be validated specifically with each test. But that's something that we could have further conversations about specifically about that.
