#### 1. FDA Updates on COVID-19 Test Development Guidance

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What should EUA holders review in their letter of authorization with regard to distributors and changes to labeling?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: EUA holders should review their letter of authorization's conditions to see when they need to notify FDA and obtain concurrence. Typically, they must inform the FDA about new distributors and receive concurrence for updated labeling but do not need concurrence for adding distributors without labeling changes.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What should EUA holders review in their letter of authorization with regard to distributors and changes to labeling?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Generally, we recommend that all EUA holders refer to their conditions of authorization in their letter of authorization to determine what needs to be sent to FDA and in which cases they need concurrence from FDA prior to implementation. In general, the conditions of authorization typically state that an EUA holder must tell the FDA of any new distributors and must have concurrence from FDA prior to implementation of any updated labeling, including any new brand names. So, the concurrence is generally only if there is updated labeling. If you are adding a new distributor without changing any labeling, we will generally acknowledge receipt, but you do not need to wait for concurrence. And that is, again, dependent on what is in your letter of authorization, but that is the typical situation for most EUAs.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE

#### 4. FDA Perspective on At-Home COVID Throat Swab Testing

QA Block 4-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What does the FDA require to demonstrate the safety of throat swabs for at-home COVID-19 diagnostics?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is open to the use of throat swabs for at-home COVID-19 diagnostics if safety concerns are addressed. However, data shows lower sensitivities compared to nasal swabs and risks such as gagging and contamination. These challenges, along with variant-specific considerations, make throat swabs less favorable.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Will FDA consider throat swabs for at-home COVID-19 diagnostic tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The CDC does recommend that throat swabs be collected only by trained health care providers. While the FDA is open to the sample type for rapid tests with data demonstrating that the safety concerns have been addressed, there has been some new evidence published. That's a UCSF paper preprint that is on the slide deck and can be referred to. I will briefly outline the key findings from that paper. They examined the use of an oral cheek swab and what they call a throat swab, which I believe is an oropharyngeal swab, for use with one of the EUA-authorized rapid antigen tests. And they compared it to nasal swab and did have a PCR comparator as well. They found that either the cheek swab or the oropharyngeal swab alone had sensitivities that were considerably below the nasal swab alone. And when they obtained a combo nasal and oropharyngeal swab, the slight sensitivity improvement was, in their opinion, did not benefit testing enough considering the risks of oropharyngeal swabs, both to health care workers who might be performing it and to the user. There is frequently gagging and even throwing up. This can potentially spread disease within the health care environment, and obviously, would also be a problem at home in obtaining an adequate sample. Also, omicron may be unique in its tissue where it replicates more readily versus the other viral variants. For example, the previously mentioned South African paper showed for delta that a nasal swab was better than saliva in their hand. So it would be a lot of work to go through and validate something that may not be the best thing for patients or for care. And then you have the next variant come along and it returns it to being the nasal swab being the best. So I think that pretty much covers our thoughts on throat swabbing, so thank you.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What qualification procedures should labs follow when using RUO reagents from non-qualified lots for a modified version of the CDC assay?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Labs using non-qualified lots of RUO reagents for a modified CDC assay should qualify each lot using CDC's procedures, which can be requested from FDA via the EUA mailbox. They should also follow the November 15 guidance to determine whether an EUA submission is needed.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What qualification procedures should labs follow when using RUO reagents from non-qualified lots for a modified version of the CDC assay?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So CDC, as we've discussed here before, has stopped qualifying lots for IDT to sell. They have stopped supporting their SARS-CoV-2-only assay. But they have also provided recommendations for laboratories that are using that CDC-- the original SARS-CoV-2 CDC assay to transition to another FDA authorized COVID-19 test. Laboratories that intend to continue performing testing using the RUO reagents, the non-qualified lots of reagents from IDT, should include qualification procedures for qualifying each lot of reagents that they purchase. CDC has provided their qualification procedures to FDA, and we're able to provide those to laboratories that need them. Excuse me. If you do need them, you can email the EUA mailbox and ask for those. Generally, since the CDC test is an authorized test, they still hold an EUA. Even though it is not being distributed any longer, labs may offer a modified version of the test under the modification policy that's included in the November 15 guidance. And so we do recommend that laboratories should consider the policies discussed in that November 15 version of the guidance the policy for coronavirus disease 2019 tests to determine whether they need to submit a new EUA request to the FDA.

#### 6. Criteria for Symptom Inclusion in Antigen Clinical Studies

QA Block 6-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: For an over-the-counter antigen all-comers clinical study, is it acceptable to exclude individuals for symptom onset greater than a certain number of days to exclude individuals with lingering symptoms?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends recording symptom information but not excluding individuals based on symptoms for an all-comers study. Data from outside the intended-use date range should not be included in primary performance determinations.
VERBATIM QUESTION: For an over-the-counter antigen all-comers clinical study, is it acceptable to exclude individuals for symptom onset greater than a certain number of days to exclude individuals with lingering symptoms?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So if you're performing an all-comers study including symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, you should not exclude anyone based on their symptoms. Instead, you should record this information, including for symptomatic individuals, the days since symptom onset. And you should also record any known exposures. Samples that are outside of the specified date range that you're requesting for your intended use should not be included in your primary determination of the agreement between your device and the comparator test. For example, if you're proposing an intended use for symptomatic individuals seven days post-symptom onset, then we would want to see performance data to support that intended use, and other data should be excluded from your primary determination of NPA and CPA.

VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, if you have-- if you have purchased lots that were qualified by either of the two sources while the CDC was still qualifying them. Those were all sold, well, I think the last sales were on and around or before September of 2021. Just check with whoever you purchase them from, IDT or Biosearch, and determine if your lots were qualified by the CDC or not. The CDC EUA remains in force, and those tests can continue to be used, although the CDC has recommended that labs move away from that because those qualified lots are going on-- those qualified tests are going away.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What should laboratories do to qualify unqualified lots of reagents distributed by IDT or Biosearch?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Laboratories must qualify unqualified reagent lots distributed by IDT or Biosearch themselves, as the CDC no longer qualifies those lots.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What should laboratories do to qualify unqualified lots of reagents distributed by IDT or Biosearch?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Since CDC is no longer supporting that assay, they are no longer qualifying lots that are distributed by IDT. But IDT is continuing to distribute unqualified lots or RUO lots. And so in that situation, a laboratory would have to qualify those lots themselves. And I would just add that in the early days, Biosearch also had lots that were qualified by the CDC, but they have also ceased distributing those qualified lots.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Are CDC-qualified lots still being distributed for any SARS-CoV-2 assays?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The CDC announced that they were no longer supporting their SARS-CoV-2 single analyte test. They announced this last summer. While they were supporting the test, they were qualifying lots of reagents that were sold by IDT, which is a reagent manufacturer. And so, private labs could purchase those qualified lots of reagents from IDT and been able to offer or to perform the CDC assay as authorized. Since CDC is no longer supporting that assay, they are no longer qualifying lots that are distributed by IDT. But IDT is continuing to distribute unqualified lots or RUO lots. And so in that situation, a laboratory would have to qualify those lots themselves. And I would just add that in the early days, Biosearch also had lots that were qualified by the CDC, but they have also ceased distributing those qualified lots. And just to add that the CDC is still supporting the multi-analyte test so there are still qualified lots for that test being sold. But I don't believe they're being sold independently. I could be wrong. I don't think the CDC was ever qualifying those tests to be made by other manufacturers, those multi-analyte meaning flu and SARS-CoV-2 are only being distributed to public health labs.

#### 19. CLIA Lab Responsibilities for EUA Test Validations

QA Block 19-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the responsibility of a CLIA certified lab in confirming that an EUA is still valid and not revoked for tests they have been using?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: EUAs are rarely revoked. If revoked "for cause," there will be an announcement and likely recall notification. Other revocations are typically due to manufacturer withdrawal and are posted on the FDA EUA website. Labs should check the website to ensure authorization remains valid; companies will notify customers of any active revocations.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the responsibility of a CLIA certified lab in confirming that an EUA is still valid and not revoked for tests they have been using?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah, so the EUAs are not revoked often. If an EUA is revoked "for cause," quote unquote, because an issue is discovered, that would be-- there would be an announcement about that. And we would also likely ask the company to perform a recall, so to notify all of their customers. Other revocations are typically for when the manufacturer has decided that they no longer want to support their test. And so they ask us to revoke it. Those are all posted on our website. So if you look on our EUA website, as long as the test that you're using is there, there's nothing that you should be concerned about. And if anything is revoked that's in active distribution, generally an announcement will be sent by the company to their customers.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Under what circumstances does an EUA holder require FDA concurrence for changes to labeling or distributors?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA generally requires EUA holders to refer to their letter of authorization for specifics, but concurrence is typically needed for updated labeling, including new brand names. Adding a new distributor without changing labeling usually only requires FDA acknowledgment.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Under what circumstances does an EUA holder require FDA concurrence for changes to labeling or distributors?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Generally, we recommend that all EUA holders refer to their conditions of authorization in their letter of authorization to determine what needs to be sent to FDA and in which cases they need concurrence from FDA prior to implementation. In general, the conditions of authorization typically state that an EUA holder must tell the FDA of any new distributors and must have concurrence from FDA prior to implementation of any updated labeling, including any new brand names. So, the concurrence is generally only if there is updated labeling. If you are adding a new distributor without changing any labeling, we will generally acknowledge receipt, but you do not need to wait for concurrence. And that is, again, dependent on what is in your letter of authorization, but that is the typical situation for most EUAs.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Will FDA consider throat swabs for at-home COVID-19 diagnostic tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is open to considering throat swabs for at-home tests if safety concerns are addressed, though they face challenges such as lower sensitivity compared to nasal swabs, safety risks during sample collection, and potential variability between variants. Current evidence suggests nasal swabs remain more effective.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Will FDA consider throat swabs for at-home COVID-19 diagnostic tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Thank you, Joe. Short answer is yes, but let me go into some detail. As stated in the previous Town Hall meeting, the CDC does recommend that throat swabs be collected only by trained health care providers. While the FDA is open to the sample type for rapid tests with data demonstrating that the safety concerns have been addressed, there has been some new evidence published. That's a UCSF paper preprint that is on the slide deck and can be referred to. I will briefly outline the key findings from that paper. They examined the use of an oral cheek swab and what they call a throat swab, which I believe is an oropharyngeal swab, for use with one of the EUA-authorized rapid antigen tests. And they compared it to nasal swab and did have a PCR comparator as well. They found that either the cheek swab or the oropharyngeal swab alone had sensitivities that were considerably below the nasal swab alone. And when they obtained a combo nasal and oropharyngeal swab, the slight sensitivity improvement was, in their opinion, did not benefit testing enough considering the risks of oropharyngeal swabs, both to health care workers who might be performing it and to the user. There is frequently gagging and even throwing up. This can potentially spread disease within the health care environment, and obviously, would also be a problem at home in obtaining an adequate sample. Also, omicron may be unique in its tissue where it replicates more readily versus the other viral variants. For example, the previously mentioned South African paper showed for delta that a nasal swab was better than saliva in their hand. So it would be a lot of work to go through and validate something that may not be the best thing for patients or for care. And then you have the next variant come along and it returns it to being the nasal swab being the best. So I think that pretty much covers our thoughts on throat swabbing, so thank you.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: How should labs using a modified version of the CDC assay handle the use of the RUO (Research Use Only) reagents from IDT for testing?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Labs using RUO reagents from IDT should include qualification procedures for each lot of reagents. CDC's qualification procedures can be obtained through FDA's EUA mailbox. Labs may offer a modified CDC assay under the November 15 policy but should consider submitting a new EUA request.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How should labs using a modified version of the CDC assay handle the use of the RUO (Research Use Only) reagents from IDT for testing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So CDC, as we've discussed here before, has stopped qualifying lots for IDT to sell. They have stopped supporting their SARS-CoV-2-only assay. But they have also provided recommendations for laboratories that are using that CDC-- the original SARS-CoV-2 CDC assay to transition to another FDA authorized COVID-19 test. Laboratories that intend to continue performing testing using the RUO reagents, the non-qualified lots of reagents from IDT, should include qualification procedures for qualifying each lot of reagents that they purchase. CDC has provided their qualification procedures to FDA, and we're able to provide those to laboratories that need them. Excuse me. If you do need them, you can email the EUA mailbox and ask for those. Generally, since the CDC test is an authorized test, they still hold an EUA. Even though it is not being distributed any longer, labs may offer a modified version of the test under the modification policy that's included in the November 15 guidance. And so we do recommend that laboratories should consider the policies discussed in that November 15 version of the guidance the policy for coronavirus disease 2019 tests to determine whether they need to submit a new EUA request to the FDA.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Do we need to sequence every patient sample to confirm the omicron strain?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA generally wants sequence confirmation for omicron strain identification. If a clinical study has not been done yet, samples should be sequenced. Any study done currently will likely involve omicron, but sequencing confirms this. Those with existing submissions should coordinate with their lead reviewer to address required sample numbers.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Do we need to sequence every patient sample to confirm the omicron strain?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Eventually we'll want-- Yeah, eventually we want sequence confirmation, but it depends on the situation. So if you've not done your clinical study yet, yes, go ahead and sequence your clinical study samples. Omicron, last time I looked, was about 99% or greater in the US. So any study that's done right now is going to most likely be omicron, and the sequencing will confirm it. Just make sure the sequencing method has been validated in some way. If somebody is already in with a submission and we're now asking for omicron information, they should work that out with their lead reviewer about the number of samples we want to see because they may have already completed a study with delta and the other information we need about those samples prior to making an authorization decision.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are there specific requirements for a CLIA lab to confirm EUA validity for tests they've already been using?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA clarified that EUAs are rarely revoked, and when an EUA is revoked, announcements are made, and customers are usually notified by the manufacturer. Labs should verify the EUA status on the FDA EUA website.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are there specific requirements for a CLIA lab to confirm EUA validity for tests they've already been using?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah, so the EUAs are not revoked often. If an EUA is revoked "for cause," quote unquote, because an issue is discovered, that would be-- there would be an announcement about that. And we would also likely ask the company to perform a recall, so to notify all of their customers. Other revocations are typically for when the manufacturer has decided that they no longer want to support their test. And so they ask us to revoke it. Those are all posted on our website. So if you look on our EUA website, as long as the test that you're using is there, there's nothing that you should be concerned about. And if anything is revoked that's in active distribution, generally an announcement will be sent by the company to their customers.
