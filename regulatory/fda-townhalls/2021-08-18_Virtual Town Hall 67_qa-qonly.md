#### 1. FDA Priorities for SARS-CoV-2 Test Development

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What review pathway does the FDA recommend for an antigen test for SARS-CoV-2, either the EUA review pathway or the traditional premarket review pathway?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends the EUA review pathway as the fastest and least burdensome option for antigen tests addressing public health needs, though sponsors may also pursue full marketing authorization via the de novo or 510(k) pathways.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What review pathway does the FDA recommend for an antigen test for SARS-CoV-2, either the EUA review pathway or the traditional premarket review pathway?
VERBATIM ANSWER: And, similar to what we've said on previous calls about both molecular and antigen tests, for tests that will most benefit the current public health needs, EUA does remain the fastest and least burdensome route to authorization. Sponsors interested in pursuing full marketing authorization through a de novo or a 510K are also welcomed to do so.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: EUA review pathway, Traditional premarket review, Antigen tests
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What additional clinical performance requirements are there for traditional premarket review pathways, such as 510K or de novo, compared to an EUA request?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA expects higher-powered, prospective clinical studies and analytical studies for traditional premarket review pathways compared to an EUA. Referencing the SARS-CoV-2 BioFire de novo summary provides insights into FDA expectations for full marketing authorization.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What additional clinical performance requirements are there for traditional premarket review pathways, such as 510K or de novo, compared to an EUA request?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Since we've not yet authorized an antigen SARS-CoV-2 test for full marketing yet, we would generally recommend a pre-submission. Typically, for full marketing authorization, we're likely to expect a higher-powered, prospective clinical study, so more positive than negative, than what we would expect to support an EUA, as well as analytical studies of course. And, while it is specific to molecular, the decision summary for the SARS-CoV-2 BioFire de novo, which is the only SARS-CoV-2 test that has received full marketing authorization at this time, might give some insight into FDA's thinking about what we're looking for full marketing authorization.

#### 3. Sample Size Considerations for Antibody Test Development

QA Block 3-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the inclusion of both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals change the sample size considerations for a total antibody test clinical trial?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Inclusion of both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals can pose a challenge, especially for detecting true positives due to potential overlap in post-vaccination and post-infection antibody presence. However, it is still feasible to meet sample size requirements. For negatives, pre-pandemic banked samples can be considered if challenges arise in finding true negatives.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the inclusion of both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals change the sample size considerations for a total antibody test clinical trial?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So, for the positives, you know, vaccinated individuals would present a challenge for total antibody tests because the spike protein will be detected. And you won't know if you're detecting post-vaccination or post-infection. Unfortunately, there is a huge percentage of those in the US now who are not vaccinated and who are acquiring COVID infection. And so it really shouldn't be a challenge to get 30 positives. The 30 that are not vaccine-- or are vaccine naive. The negatives, as we increase the numbers of US citizens who are-- or folks in the US who are either vaccinated and/or post-infection, the latest estimates I've seen is that somewhere just shy of 10% of those in the US-- and I think numerous publications, high-quality publications, note this is somewhere shy of 10% have been infected in the US based on seroprevalence. And then, of course, somewhere around 50% of the people in the US have gotten somewhere around one vaccine at least. So that unfortunately leaves about somewhere around 40% of the folks who are both vaccine naive and potentially have not been infected. You can also use pre-pandemic banked negative samples for the negative pool. Don't know how pre-pandemic banks are doing as far as available volumes to provide to test developers, but that's certainly an option. I see that serology test developers will be having an increasing challenge to find true negative, let's say, fresh samples, during the pandemic samples. And, when you run into those sort of problems, just chat with our review staff. You know, eventually, we are likely to have to move to a different comparator method establishing, initially, probably sooner on the negative side and then, eventually, potentially on the positive side, as we unfortunately move to 100% either post- infection and/or post-vaccination population. But, for right now, we think it's still doable. The numbers are relatively small at 30 and 75.

SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Sample size considerations, Total antibody test, Vaccinated vs. unvaccinated participants
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 3-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the FDA have a recommendation on the distribution of positive and negative samples required if both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals are included?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA acknowledges challenges in recruiting vaccinated individuals for antibody tests because vaccination may affect test results. It advises using vaccine-naive individuals for positives and allows using pre-pandemic negative samples if supply issues arise. FDA advises consulting review staff in case of difficulties.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA have a recommendation on the distribution of positive and negative samples required if both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals are included?
VERBATIM ANSWER: For the positives, you know, vaccinated individuals would present a challenge for total antibody tests because the spike protein will be detected.

SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: OTC home-use antigen test evaluation, visual vs. smartphone app interpretation
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 4-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does interpreting a test with a smartphone app require the device to capture and analyze an image to determine results?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA considers a test to be interpreted by a smartphone app when the device's camera captures an image, performs image analysis, and determines whether the test result is positive or negative. Simply recording a visually-read result on the app does not count as interpretation by the app.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does interpreting a test with a smartphone app require the device to capture and analyze an image to determine results?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah. So, when we talk about a smartphone app interpreting the test, it's not recording. It's not having the patient record the result on the smartphone manually. It's you have a camera function. And you have a camera function, and the camera records an image. And it is image analysis, and the smartphone image analysis is deciding whether the test is positive or negative. It's when the smartphone is doing all of that that we need to see a separate 30 positive and 30 negative in the OTC environment. But, if all of the smartphone is doing is having the patient record the result that they visually read, that is part of the user testing and the clinical study. And you don't need to have a separate study to analyze that.

TOPICS: Smartphone app test interpretation, Clinical study requirements
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 4-5
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the difference between a smartphone app capturing and analyzing an image versus a user manually recording the result?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: A smartphone app interpreting the test involves the camera function capturing an image, followed by image analysis to automatically determine the test result. In contrast, manually entering a visually interpreted result into the app does not count as smartphone interpretation and does not require a separate study.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the difference between a smartphone app capturing and analyzing an image versus a user manually recording the result?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah. So, when we talk about a smartphone app interpreting the test, it's not recording. It's not having the patient record the result on the smartphone manually.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: Artificial saliva is not acceptable; fresh saliva is preferred. Frozen banked saliva might be considered if validated through fresh/frozen studies to ensure freezing does not affect the sample.
VERBATIM QUESTION: For a saliva COVID test intended for the CLIA setting with freshly collected saliva, would it be acceptable to use artificial saliva or another commercial source of saliva where the saliva isn't fresh?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah, that's a really specific question. And I think it's best to work with our review staff. So artificial saliva, no, that's not going to be acceptable. We see saliva continuing to be a very challenging sample type. Some recent publications imply that the viral levels can be lower, and shedding can be for shorter periods of time. I don't know what the truth is, other than we have directly observed that there's some challenges with saliva. And that doesn't allow us to authorize that sample type. So it needs to be real. Potentially, frozen banked could be used, but, in all likelihood, we'd ask you to do a fresh/frozen study to make sure that freezing the sample neither degrades or frees up additional virus and might artificially increase the sensitivity of the test. So, potentially, it's OK, but I think that's a detailed enough question, best left to our front-line review staff to help you out. Hopefully, that's somewhat helpful to you.

#### 9. Evolving Standards for Immunity Assessment and Antibody Testing Challenges

QA Block 9-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the FDA's view on the importance and priority of antibody testing and immunity assessment in light of recent CDC data on vaccine efficacy?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is monitoring clinical trials on immunity determination but emphasizes caution in relying on serology tests due to challenges in defining precise immunity levels for SARS-CoV-2, given mutations and variability. Progress depends on conclusive data and alignment with international standards.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the FDA's view on the importance and priority of antibody testing and immunity assessment in light of recent CDC data on vaccine efficacy?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah, so there's more than a dozen ongoing clinical trials of immunity determination, all on ClinicalTrials.gov, that we're monitoring. The FDA is not running them. And we're looking forward to seeing the results of that before we look to offer pathways to seek- - clear pathways to seek immunity or protection claims for serology tests. If we look at other situations where the FDA has authorized serology tests for this sort of purpose, rubella is a really good example. There is a fully quantitative rubella serology tests traceable to international standard so that all the tests are in agreement when you get IUs per mL. And all the longitudinal studies have helped us understand-- helped all of us understand what a sterilizing level of antibodies are for rubella. So you know precise cutoffs above and below which you make clinical decisions about. That was the hope for SARS-CoV-2. And we are still looking forward to seeing the results of those outcomes studies. And, if they're able to define such a level that can be traceable to an international standard, in all likelihood, a fully quantitative test may be needed. Then we will move forward. And, any device that's already authorized and can meet that standard, we will update-- very willing to update their authorization without them, those developers, having to do their own outcome studies. We will not-- because we can link-- if we can link things to an international standard, then it takes away the need for all the separate serology devices that may be able to meet the need to have to do their own outcome studies. That would be very-- that would not be in the best interests of public health. However, I do want to caution listeners that we don't do serology testing for some viruses, for example, for flu. And there is a reason for that. And, due to the variants, which occasionally now appear to have breakthrough infections, even in fully vaccinated people, like Delta, it's quite clear that, when you take into account variants and mutations, that there are differing levels of-- when you measure neutralizing ability, different levels, whether you got vaccinated, or you have natural infection and what variant you got natural infection from. And then, when you look at other variants, what is the neutralizing level of antibody? And they're not-- the current data, my read of the current data-- and it's just my read-- but our team of serology experts at the FDA has been examining this and keeping track of this. So we're seeing concerning signs that it may be challenging to define a precise and accurate level of immunity or protection that would cover potentially all scenarios, whatever you were infected with or whatever you were vaccinated with and then all the current circulating mutations and vaccines. So I'm just urging caution here. We will be driven by the results of data. And, if the data supports it, the FDA will absolutely support those claims in the manner that I addressed.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the eight-month booster recommendation apply uniformly across individuals, and could serology tests help determine personal immunity status?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The eight-month booster recommendation is likely moving toward a universal public health level guidance similar to annual flu vaccines. Currently, FDA does not recommend using serology tests to determine individual immunity as the data is complex, and valid clinical interpretations for individuals are still being studied.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the eight-month booster recommendation apply uniformly across individuals, and could serology tests help determine personal immunity status?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah, as I said on our recent national call with infectious disease docs and clinicians, you know, I think we're looking at not who shouldn't get vaccinated, but rather who should be vaccinated and/or get a booster. The feeling that I'm getting-- and this is a feeling, and it's a gestalt of all the literature I'm reading-- is that we're moving towards a recommendation at the public health level, and it's not my decision, but more like flu, which you're supposed to get an annual flu vaccine. But, again, I'm not speaking for the FDA or the vaccine group here. I'm addressing the question of the utility and clinical validity of using serology tests here. And I will say that the benefit/risk for serology testing, as just sort of espoused by you and others that I've talked to, we don't want serology tests to be misused. And we don't want the wrong interpretations to be made on the basis of a serology test because, as I said, it's very complex. How did you gain an antibody response specifically? And have we done all of the work to find what it means for you down to the individual? I mean, population studies are one thing. And getting a p-value of less than 0.05 is one thing. But knowing what to give you as a patient, a specific recommendation, that's really what the FDA is focused on, not on population studies. We look at what is the best way to inform individual patients of their health. So to be honest, it's very complex. And we're very open to it. And I'm giving you my personal, not FDA, speak here on vaccines. And I don't want to confuse that. I really want to make sure that's in the transcript. That's just kind of the way we're looking at it. And, when I'm reading what others are recommending, I think that's what they're saying, but, again, and that's why they're making this recommendation probably for eight months to get boosters after your first vaccination.

The FDA's focus is on individual patient guidance rather than population-level studies.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How does the complexity of interpreting antibody responses influence FDA guidelines or recommendations for serology use?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah, as I said on our recent national call with infectious disease docs and clinicians, you know, I think we're looking at not who shouldn't get vaccinated, but rather who should be vaccinated and/or get a booster. The feeling that I'm getting-- and this is a feeling, and it's a gestalt of all the literature I'm reading-- is that we're moving towards a recommendation at the public health level, and it's not my decision, but more like flu, which you're supposed to get an annual flu vaccine. But, again, I'm not speaking for the FDA or the vaccine group here. I'm addressing the question of the utility and clinical validity of using serology tests here. And I will say that the benefit/risk for serology testing, as just sort of espoused by you and others that I've talked to, we don't want serology tests to be misused. And we don't want the wrong interpretations to be made on the basis of a serology test because, as I said, it's very complex. How did you gain an antibody response specifically? And have we done all of the work to find what it means for you down to the individual? I mean, population studies are one thing. And getting a p-value of less than 0.05 is one thing. But knowing what to give you as a patient, a specific recommendation, that's really what the FDA is focused on, not on population studies. We look at what is the best way to inform individual patients of their health. So to be honest, it's very complex. And we're very open to it. And I'm giving you my personal, not FDA, speak here on vaccines. And I don't want to confuse that. I really want to make sure that's in the transcript.

#### 10. RT-PCR Comparators in Serology Clinical Testing Explained

QA Block 10-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Would you be utilizing the RT-PCR to screen and enroll for the serology clinical testing people who are positive at their initial visit?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA uses RT-PCR to determine whether a patient was infected with SARS-CoV-2 and evaluate serology test performance by days after the infection. They aim for high sensitivity within two to three weeks after infection while maintaining specificity.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Would you be utilizing the RT-PCR to screen and enroll for the serology clinical testing people who are positive at their initial visit?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So we want the RT-PCR test to establish the closest thing to truth about whether that patient was infected or not with SARS-CoV-2. And then we're looking at the day after symptoms and/or after the molecular test to look at how soon is the test, the serology test, able to detect an antibody response to that infection. And then we list performance, as you've seen in all the prior authorizations, by days after ranges. And we really want to see that, in the two to three week range, performance achieves expectations as far as sensitivity and while maintaining adequate specificity. Hopefully, that addressed your question.

#### 13. FDA's Role in Serial Testing and Long COVID

QA Block 13-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How is the FDA policing the serial testing to prevent people from misinterpreting usage instructions and reporting positives incorrectly?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA does not have resources to ensure home users perform serial testing as labeled. The agency relies on proper labeling and recognizes risks associated with OTC use without clinician involvement. OTC authorizations are assessed cautiously, considering benefits and risks.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How is the FDA policing the serial testing to prevent people from misinterpreting usage instructions and reporting positives incorrectly?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So, unfortunately or maybe fortunately, we don't have the resources to check that home OTC users are doing serial testing. That's how the devices are labeled, and that's how we want them to test. But there's really-- we don't expect the manufacturers to ensure that their users are following that. What we expect is that the labeling is good, instructs them on what to do, and then we understand that, when things go to an OTC environment, that they could be used in all sorts of different ways. And that is a risk of OTC when a clinician is not involved. And it's why really the FDA is a lot more cautious in authorizing OTCs. Now, obviously, we've done it numerous times, but those are the-- when we do our likely benefit to likely risk calculations for every EUA, for OTC, that goes into the hopper. And we compute that at least with brain power.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is the FDA assisting clinicians in diagnosing or monitoring post-COVID syndrome cases?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recognizes some post-COVID cases lack prior diagnostic confirmation and relies on existing biomarkers and serology tests to support clinicians in evaluating potential long-COVID cases. The FDA is open to reviewing new diagnostic technologies but cannot provide standardized recommendations due to the diversity in approaches.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is the FDA assisting clinicians in diagnosing or monitoring post-COVID syndrome cases?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So we know that at least some of these cases did not have an original documented diagnostic test confirmation of COVID with, say, an antigen test or an RT-PCR test. And so clinicians are seeing symptoms of an overactive immune system. And they look at various biomarkers that are on the market to assess that. As part of that workup, we understand that those clinicians are using a serology test to confirm whether or not those individuals have had prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and developed an antibody response. So that can be very helpful in the assessment of those kids. And, certainly, there is interest in developers. And we've had ongoing conversations about additional tests that may help assess whether or not it is long COVID in kids or in others or not. And so the FDA is committed to taking a look at those ideas and those applications and assessing them for their benefit/risk in this pandemic response. So they really-- it's not something that we can easily come up with a template and a set of recommendations for because these technologies really are all over the map in ideas. And so it's not something like, we know what the virus is, and we're going to detect it with molecular means, antigen means, or serology means. Those are a lot more standard sort of ways to assess infection or prior infection. And so we take these one off. We assess them one by one. And, certainly, as I said, we would be open to assessing these technologies for their benefit in the pandemic response. Hopefully, that addresses your question.

Yeah, so we have discussed this on this call previously, although it would probably be several weeks back if you wanted to go look at the transcript. But yeah, we have talked about this that BioFire is the formal predicate, as it is the only test that is legally marketed beyond an EUA.

QA Block 15-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can serology differentiate between natural infection and vaccination, such as through neutralization antibodies versus spike protein antibodies?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Clinicians can use serology tests to determine if antibodies indicate vaccination (spike protein-only antibodies) or natural infection (antibodies to other virus parts like N protein). A positive spike protein and negative N protein signal vaccination, while both being positive suggests natural infection possibly combined with vaccination.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can serology differentiate between natural infection and vaccination, such as through neutralization antibodies versus spike protein antibodies?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, we put out some communication. Toby can correct me here. So clinicians can definitely use the appropriate serology test or tests to assess whether just spike protein antibodies have been formed versus some other part of the virus that other assays, but the vaccines don't target. So, obviously, positive on spike protein and negative on, say, N protein would suggest vaccination only. But, if you were to also see and confirm N protein antibodies as well, then it would suggest that there had been a natural infection plus or minus vaccine.

REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 15-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can clinicians use serology tests to distinguish between different viral proteins not targeted by vaccines?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Clinicians can use serology tests to determine if spike protein antibodies, associated with vaccination, are present or if N protein antibodies indicate natural infection, with or without vaccination.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can clinicians use serology tests to distinguish between different viral proteins not targeted by vaccines?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, we put out some communication. Toby can correct me here. So clinicians can definitely use the appropriate serology test or tests to assess whether just spike protein antibodies have been formed versus some other part of the virus that other assays, but the vaccines don't target. So, obviously, positive on spike protein and negative on, say, N protein would suggest vaccination only. But, if you were to also see and confirm N protein antibodies as well, then it would suggest that there had been a natural infection plus or minus vaccine.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What does it mean for a test to be interpreted using a smartphone app?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: A test interpreted using a smartphone app involves the camera capturing an image, using image analysis to determine if the test is positive or negative. Manually recording results on the smartphone does not constitute interpretation by the app.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What does it mean for a test to be interpreted using a smartphone app?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah. So, when we talk about a smartphone app interpreting the test, it's not recording. It's not having the patient record the result on the smartphone manually. It's you have a camera function. And you have a camera function, and the camera records an image. And it is image analysis, and the smartphone image analysis is deciding whether the test is positive or negative. It's when the smartphone is doing all of that that we need to see a separate 30 positive and 30 negative in the OTC environment. But, if all of the smartphone is doing is having the patient record the result that they visually read, that is part of the user testing and the clinical study. And you don't need to have a separate study to analyze that.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Is it necessary to update the EUA for all app changes of the product already granted EUA?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah, so, if it doesn't affect the performance, the sensitivity, specificity, usability of the test, then we're unlikely to ask for any data. But I would bring that up in the initial review process of your test and address that question with our front-line review staff.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is the FDA doing anything related to the post-COVID-19 syndrome?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA acknowledges that many post-COVID cases lack documented diagnostic confirmation. Clinicians use serology tests to identify prior exposure, and FDA actively evaluates potential tests to diagnose and monitor long COVID, though recommendations vary by technology.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is the FDA doing anything related to the post-COVID-19 syndrome?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So we know that at least some of these cases did not have an original documented diagnostic test confirmation of COVID with, say, an antigen test or an RT-PCR test. And so clinicians are seeing symptoms of an overactive immune system. And they look at various biomarkers that are on the market to assess that. As part of that workup, we understand that those clinicians are using a serology test to confirm whether or not those individuals have had prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and developed an antibody response. So that can be very helpful in the assessment of those kids. And, certainly, there is interest in developers. And we've had ongoing conversations about additional tests that may help assess whether or not it is long COVID in kids or in others or not. And so the FDA is committed to taking a look at those ideas and those applications and assessing them for their benefit/risk in this pandemic response. So they really-- it's not something that we can easily come up with a template and a set of recommendations for because these technologies really are all over the map in ideas. And so it's not something like, we know what the virus is, and we're going to detect it with molecular means, antigen means, or serology means. Those are a lot more standard sort of ways to assess infection or prior infection. And so we take these one off. We assess them one by one. And, certainly, as I said, we would be open to assessing these technologies for their benefit in the pandemic response. Hopefully, that addresses your question.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are two additional EUA-approved or FDA-approved devices still required as comparators for a respiratory panel molecular test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: BioFire Respiratory Panel 2.1 is the formal predicate device for 510K pathway assays but does not have to be the comparator. Other EUA-authorized tests may be used if BioFire is not available.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are two additional EUA-approved or FDA-approved devices still required as comparators for a respiratory panel molecular test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah, for the 510K pathway follow-on molecular assays that can follow that reg, the BioFire assay is the formal predicate device. That does not mean that it has to be the comparator. And Toby, I know you're a little bit more fluent in this. And maybe I can have you finish our response. Sure. Yeah, so we have discussed this on this call previously, although it would probably be several weeks back if you wanted to go look at the transcript. But yeah, we have talked about this that BioFire is the formal predicate, as it is the only test that is legally marketed beyond an EUA. But you can still use other EUA-authorized tests as your comparator since we know that BioFire may not be available to all developers as a comparator.
