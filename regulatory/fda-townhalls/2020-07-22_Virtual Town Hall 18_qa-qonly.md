#### 1. FDA Updates on COVID-19 Testing Policies and Guidance

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What templates are currently being worked on, and how can developers provide feedback?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA is updating several templates, including those for non-laboratory molecular testing, multi-analyte tests, and pooling methodologies. Developers can email the FDA template address for feedback or questions.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What templates are currently being worked on, and how can developers provide feedback?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We are working on a number of template additions and updates. And unfortunately, they're not publicly available yet although if any developer has any questions on any of these topics send us an email to the template email address box. And we've given quite a bit of thought to most of these already and can provide feedback. So that includes what we used to call home testing for molecular diagnostics indirect antigen. That will be transitioning to being called a non-laboratory testing because the setting may not always be home could be schools or places, et cetera. We're working on updates to the regular molecular template to include more information about pooling, more information about simple, or Dorfman pooling as well as what to do if you want to pool swabs. We're also updating language having to do with development of multi-analyte tests including things, like, Flu A, Flu B in addition to SARS. We are working on finalizing what used to be called the serology home collection which will now be the non-laboratory serology collection template. We are working also a little bit further out will be what we used to refer to as serology home testing which will now be serology non-laboratory testing. And then finally we've been requested to update our direct antigen template to allow for recommendations for multi-analyte testing. So just like molecular with direct antigen you can put more than one target on the direct antigen test so you could for example look at Flu A and B again in addition to SARS.

QA Block 1-10
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What prompted the FDA's decision to revoke the umbrella EUA for serology tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA revoked the umbrella EUA for serology tests as an administrative decision, finding it more efficient to individualize EUAs for each test to allow broader and more specific authorizations. This shift streamlines the process and does not change EUA submission expectations.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What prompted the FDA's decision to revoke the umbrella EUA for serology tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We have revoked the umbrella EUA for serology tests. From our perspective we see this as fairly administrative. In the three months since we issued that umbrella EUA no tests have been added to it because we found that it is more appropriate for us to individualize the EUAs for each specific test so that we can allow for a broader indication for scopes of authorization on individualized conditions of authorization that are specific to each unique test. So this is - we had intended for the umbrella EUA to remind the administratorNWX-FDA OC US of progress from our end. But it turns out that doing individual EUAs is actually the more streamlined process for us. So this does not change anything from the perspective of what we expect to see in EUA requests. We're still using the NCI data to inform our decisions for the individual EUAs as we have been doing and we will continue to do that.

#### 2. Neutralizing Antibody Assays and FDA EUA Preparation

QA Block 2-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Do you think the data outlined is sufficient for the initial pre-EUA discussion for a neutralizing assay and an acidity assay, and are there other data your team might want to see in the application?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA believes the outlined data is sufficient for the initial pre-EUA discussion and acknowledges the preparation, specifically regarding the proposed methods, correlation data, and linearity testing. They aim to develop more detailed templates as criteria evolve.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Do you think the data outlined is sufficient for the initial pre-EUA discussion for a neutralizing assay and an acidity assay, and are there other data your team might want to see in the application?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, I think so. I think you're very well prepared for the first conversation. And you've hit on all the important points for neutralizing tests. Those could either be, like, you said the PRNT which is considered by us to be the gold standard method for determining neutralizing antibody. Or it could be as you said for your - sounds, like, for your assay that you're developing an assay that could correlate to results on the same samples with a neutralizing reference method. And absolutely open to that. We are looking for those strong correlations. We also realize that semi-quant or quantitative serology assays are going to be required probably to do this well of course. And so you talked about linearity there, dynamic range, how you calibrate, how you quantify, is all going to be important information. And we've been working with our other federal agency colleagues to understand this landscape to adopt new criteria that we can use to assess these technologies. So we are making substantial progress on being prepared to review these submissions. And of course as soon as we are thinking it's more crystallized, we'll do a template that will deal with semi-quant, quant and neutralizing type for serology assays.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are there specific validation guidelines or criteria for using BLI technology as a gold standard in the K on and K off measurements for acidity assays?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA does not have sufficient expertise to comment on BLI technology as a gold standard for K on and K off measurements but recommends discussing with their team for informed guidance.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are there specific validation guidelines or criteria for using BLI technology as a gold standard in the K on and K off measurements for acidity assays?
VERBATIM ANSWER: I'm not expert enough in that kind of test validation method. You know I'm fairly familiar with bicore and other technologies, like, that. But not actually measuring that in an assay. So - and seeking EUA authorization for that it sounds very intriguing and, you know, perhaps could be important to not just measure the presence of neutralizing antibodies. But maybe the strengths of those bonds. But - and I don't know yet. It's the first time, you know, that I've been thinking about this. The team's probably thought about this already. So I would defer to the team on this. And so I'm not even familiar with the technology mentioned. I'll have to look it up. But it sounds, like, you're very knowledgeable so I expect you're going to have a very well-informed discussion with the FDA. And I look forward to following your progress.

#### 4. Guidelines for COVID-19 Serology Screening and CLIA Regulations

QA Block 4-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can healthcare providers purchase properly labeled IgM and IgG fingerstick tests from a distributor and use them for screening but not diagnosis at the point of care?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Healthcare providers cannot use IgM or IgG fingerstick tests for point-of-care screening unless authorized with a CLIA waiver. Such tests are currently restricted to high-complexity CLIA labs.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can healthcare providers purchase properly labeled IgM and IgG fingerstick tests from a distributor and use them for screening but not diagnosis at the point of care?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So we consider screening - it's not really a diagnostic for serology. But we'd consider that governed by FDA regulation.

#### 5. EUA Submission Process and Reporting Responsibilities Explained

QA Block 5-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the process of EUA template submission, including the review timeline and type of response to expect?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA reviews EUA submissions, starting with tests already validated and notified. Marketing can begin after validation while submissions are reviewed for completeness, public health concerns, and priority status. High-priority applications are expedited, others receive updates and contact for queries. Reviews aim to be completed in about two weeks, with faster timelines expected as backlogs are cleared.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the process of EUA template submission, including the review timeline and type of response to expect?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Okay serology. So serology are allowed to submit or at least validate and notify us. And then we'll review that notification and we can decide to post that notification on our Web site. And then if you certified that you validated for the intended purposes following the guidelines you can begin marketing that test while we review that submission. We will do an initial assessment of that submission to make sure there are no public health concerns. To make sure that it is complete. And to assess whether it is one of the high priorities. The reason for high priority is we've gotten so many applications needing so many high priority applications that especially those that require EUA authorization to be able to market the test versus a serology test that can be marketed following notification. You know we want to get to those applications first that require our review and authorization. So and both assessments will be done. If there's any concerns whether it's incomplete or we think the data doesn't look good we will reach back out to you. If it is classified as a high priority as soon as there is room on the reviewer's plate, they'll move that in ahead of lower priority application. And if you're deemed to be a lower priority application you will still be given a contact to keep you updated weekly on your submission and be able to ask questions, and get any sort of reassurances that you need about where things stand. I've directed the office that within two weeks of those EUAs, hopefully a lot sooner than that now that we've cleared some backlog because there's hundreds NWX-FDA OC US of applications, that we can get to that much quicker than two weeks. So you should hopefully get an assignment - a user, reviewer or somebody that you can otherwise contact to get a status update. Hopefully that clarifies that process.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Will the new pooling guidelines in the updated template affect our upcoming EUA submission or should we not worry about it?
VERBATIM ANSWER: It should not. We're basically providing some more helpful information. The criteria are essentially the same. So we're adding, for example, if you want to pool swabs there's some additional studies that would be important, you know, if you put multiple swabs in one VTM you would accumulate potentially more mucin which can inhibit DTR reaction. Also you could have really, really high virus. If the members of the pool all had high virus and then suddenly you have a sample that has a lot more virus than a normal sample would be which can potentially inhibit the reaction as well. Well not necessarily inhibit the reaction but use up the reactants more quickly than expected and potentially give you a false-negative result. As far as simple Dorfman pooling or even combinatorial pooling the guidance, recommendations aren't going to really change. What we're doing is providing some more helpful information to those labs that want to develop this.

#### 7. Sensitivity Requirements for Isotypes in Multiplex Reporting

QA Block 7-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the sensitivity requirement for A and M when reporting isotypes separately in a multiplex test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA has not yet authorized tests for IgA, making it difficult to establish a specific sensitivity requirement. For IgM, the sensitivity must be 90% when tested alone, and 70% when combined with IgG. FDA recommends engaging with their team regarding the sensitivity of potential A-M combinations via the Pre-EUA or EUA pathways.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the sensitivity requirement for A and M when reporting isotypes separately in a multiplex test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So we haven't - I don't know that we've authorized an A yet. For M we have authorized M within a multiplex. And we've also authorized M alone. So M in the presence of an IgG say we are allowing it to be down in the 70 percent range for positive — percent positive agreement or sensitivity whereas IGG, those same devices are expected to be 90%. We're really wanting serology and then IGM alone, we set the bar at 90% because we're really wanting to hit the 90% bar for sensitivity to make these tests as useful as possible. We think that's importantly clinically to not have false negative for serology and otherwise it lowers the usefulness of those tests. For IGA like I said we haven't authorized it so it's probably best for me to say that it's good to engage in a dialogue here because A-M combination is not something that we've authorized yet. I would expect that we still want to see one — at least one of those analyzed to be positive at the 90% level. But again I think it's best because it's not something that we've — made a public decision on yet, that you engage with our team through either the Pre-EUA pathway or the EUA pathway.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: For IgM, the FDA requires 90% sensitivity when reported alone and 70% when in combination with IgG. IgA has not been authorized yet, and sensitivity requirements for IgA remain undecided. Engagement with FDA via Pre-EUA or EUA pathways for further clarity is encouraged.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the general sensitivity requirement for M and A when reporting separately?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So we haven't - I don't know that we've authorized an A yet. For M we have authorized M within a multiplex. And we've also authorized M alone. So M in the presence of an IgG say we are allowing it to be down in the 70 percent range for positive — percent positive agreement or sensitivity whereas IGG, those same devices are expected to be 90%. We're really wanting serology and then IGM alone, we set the bar at 90% because we're really wanting to hit the 90% bar for sensitivity to make these tests as useful as possible. We think that's importantly clinically to not have false negative for serology and otherwise it lowers the usefulness of those tests. For IGA like I said we haven't authorized it so it's probably best for me to say that it's good to engage in a dialogue here because A-M combination is not something that we've authorized yet. I would expect that we still want to see one — at least one of those analyzed to be positive at the 90% level. But again I think it's best because it's not something that we've — made a public decision on yet, that you engage with our team through either the Pre-EUA pathway or the EUA pathway.

QA Block 15-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can samples using days post symptom onset and days post PCR confirmation be used together in the same analysis?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA will assess submissions with both sample types but prefers days post symptom onset as the key metric. Submissions with only days post PCR confirmation may be evaluated but are more challenging to assess due to variability.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can samples using days post symptom onset and days post PCR confirmation be used together in the same analysis?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Well we'll do our best but if you don't have days past symptoms in the sample it's going to be really hard for us unless you have — we'll take a look at different categories I'm imagining. I can't pre-speak. So submit what you have — if that's what you have then we'll assess the adequacy of that information and the adaquacy of the performance. And you know, we'll do our best to work with you but it'll be a little bit more challenging if you don't have days from symptoms on all samples. It doesn't matter at all about days with PCR because PCR can be done at any point after symptoms and it's variable.

QA Block 15-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What specific information from the serology template should developers review to address combining days post symptom onset and days post PCR confirmation data?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends developers review the serology template for details on combining data. Days post symptom onset are emphasized because they are critical to assess test performance, aiming for maximum sensitivity after 14 days. Days post PCR are also useful but less critical.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What specific information from the serology template should developers review to address combining days post symptom onset and days post PCR confirmation data?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So yes. The serology template has some details on that and if it's not clear enough you can go to our template. Well, go to your direct contact for that submission, whoever your contact is at our office. So the most important date that we if you have days post PCR that's good. NWX-FDA OC US Please include it. The most important date in the way that we assess performance is post symptom and that is because we expect certain performance by certain days after symptoms. Basically, after 14 days, the test should have maximal PPA or sensitivity but prior to 14 days, the serology test may not have that. It's very important for us to know the days past symptoms in order to assess accurately and adequately assess the performance, and not bias against data that might be prior to 14 days that is falsely negative.

VERBATIM QUESTION: How do samples without days post symptom onset data impact performance evaluation?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Well we'll do our best but if you don't have days past symptoms in the sample it's going to be really hard for us unless you have — we'll take a look at different categories I'm imagining.

QA Block 15-5
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Why does the FDA prioritize days post symptom onset over days post PCR confirmation for performance assessment?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA prioritizes days post symptom onset because it is the most reliable way to assess test performance. After 14 days, tests should reach maximal sensitivity, while earlier data may not reflect true performance. Days post PCR can vary and are less indicative.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Why does the FDA prioritize days post symptom onset over days post PCR confirmation for performance assessment?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The most important date in the way that we assess performance is post symptom and that is because we expect certain performance by certain days after symptoms. Basically, after 14 days, the test should have maximal PPA or sensitivity but prior to 14 days, the serology test may not have that. It's very important for us to know the days past symptoms in order to assess accurately and adequately assess the performance, and not bias against data that might be prior to 14 days that is falsely negative. Its days post symptom that we've really been centering on to assess performance because those are — that's the most reliable way of assessing performance one test to another because that's why the patient symptoms not by when a particular PCR test is done.

REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 15-6
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How should developers handle cases where data on days post symptom onset is incomplete or missing?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA advises submitting all available data, as they will review its adequacy. However, the absence of data on days post symptom onset makes evaluation more challenging. Days with PCR are less relevant for performance assessment.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How should developers handle cases where data on days post symptom onset is incomplete or missing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Well we'll do our best but if you don't have days past symptoms in the sample it's going to be really hard for us unless you have — we'll take a look at different categories I'm imagining. I can't pre-speak. So submit what you have — if that's what you have then we'll assess the adequacy of that information and the adaquacy of the performance. And you know, we'll do our best to work with you but it'll be a little bit more challenging if you don't have days from symptoms on all samples. It doesn't matter at all about days with PCR because PCR can be done at any point after symptoms and it's variable.

QA Block 15-7
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the implications of submitting serology test data that includes falsely negative results from samples collected prior to 14 days post symptom onset?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA uses the post-symptom onset timeline to assess serology test performance. After 14 days, tests should show maximal sensitivity, but earlier samples might appear falsely negative. Including days past symptom data ensures accurate performance evaluation.

#### 16. FDA Revocation Policy Clarification and Impact on Testing

QA Block 16-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Has the revocation of IGG IGM tests affected the Abbott test authorized on April 26?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The revocation of IGG IGM tests has not affected the Abbott test authorized on April 26. The FDA did not revoke any assays, just an umbrella policy designed to streamline internal processes. This change has not impacted approval criteria or testing methods.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Has the revocation of IGG IGM tests affected the Abbott test authorized on April 26?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Not at all. We didn't revoke any assay. We simply revoked an umbrella policy that was put in place to make our work easier. It's internal to the FDA paperwork saving situation. If something fits under an umbrella basically there's fewer — there's less review that has to happen because all the conditions have seen pre-set for authorization so it is simply an efficiency internal to the FDA efficiency, our criteria for what is — what the bar is for something that's an accessible test has not changed at all. Our great use of NCI testing hasn't changed at all. In the case of central lab tests currently we're not able to really assess central lab tests via the NCI because it would require to split panels — blinded panels to send out and we're — and those samples could get really well-annotated samples that perform well, that have been vetted extremely well by our process is a bit of an onerous task so until we catch up with basically the amount of — with the huge volume of backlogging NCI with the current serology test there it's — that's our focus right now. Hopefully that puts you at ease. Anything — nothing with the revocation on the 21st no tests were revoked at all. It's just the policy that was revoked.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Do you think using BLI technology as the gold standard for K on and K off measurement in an acidity assay will be acceptable?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA is not familiar enough with this validation method to provide a definitive answer. It will defer to the team for evaluation, but the approach appears intriguing and potentially useful.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Do you think using BLI technology as the gold standard for K on and K off measurement in an acidity assay will be acceptable?
VERBATIM ANSWER: I'm not expert enough in that kind of test validation method. You know I'm fairly familiar with bicore and other technologies, like, that. But not actually measuring that in an assay. So - and seeking EUA authorization for that it sounds very intriguing and, you know, perhaps could be important to not just measure the presence of neutralizing antibodies. But maybe the strengths of those bonds. But - and I don't know yet. It's the first time, you know, that I've been thinking about this. The team's probably thought about this already. So I would defer to the team on this. And so I'm not even familiar with the technology mentioned. I'll have to look it up. But it sounds, like, you're very knowledgeable so I expect you're going to have a very well-informed discussion with the FDA. And I look forward to following your progress.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the sensitivity requirements for IgM when it is included as part of a multiplex test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: For IgM, the sensitivity requirement in a multiplex test including IgG can be 70%, but IgM alone must meet a 90% sensitivity requirement.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the sensitivity requirements for IgM when it is included as part of a multiplex test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: For M we have authorized M within a multiplex. And we've also authorized M alone. So M in the presence of an IgG say we are allowing it to be down in the 70 percent range for positive — percent positive agreement or sensitivity whereas IGG, those same devices are expected to be 90%. We're really wanting serology and then IGM alone, we set the bar at 90% because we're really wanting to hit the 90% bar for sensitivity to make these tests as useful as possible. We think that's importantly clinically to not have false negative for serology and otherwise it lowers the usefulness of those tests.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: How should we calculate days post PCR confirmation versus days post symptom onset for a serology application?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA considers days post symptom onset to be the most important metric for assessing performance, as it aligns with expected performance timelines like reaching maximum sensitivity after 14 days. Days post PCR confirmation is considered less reliable for this purpose but should still be included in the application.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How should we calculate days post PCR confirmation versus days post symptom onset for a serology application?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The serology template has some details on that and if it's not clear enough you can go to our template. Well, go to your direct contact for that submission, whoever your contact is at our office. So the most important date that we if you have days post PCR that's good. NWX-FDA OC US Please include it.
