#### 2. FDA Criteria for Neutralizing Antibody Assay Validation

QA Block 2-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What criteria does the FDA use or plan to use to assess assays for neutralizing antibodies, especially assays that involve binding of spike proteins to its receptors as a surrogate to the use of live virus?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is welcoming EUA applications for neutralizing antibody tests to determine potential donors for convalescent plasma. Tests can include routine serology correlating to a neutralizing reference method or direct testing methods that are often semi-quantitative or quantitative. Comparisons to validated reference methods are necessary. FDA encourages early dialogue to establish performance and introduce guidance in future templates.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What criteria does the FDA use or plan to use to assess assays for neutralizing antibodies, especially assays that involve binding of spike proteins to its receptors as a surrogate to the use of live virus?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Okay. Yes, so we're very welcome of EUA applications for neutralizing antibody tests. Obviously, there's health determined among other things, folks who might be good donors for convalescent plasma. And there are two types of assays that include say neutralizing claims. One is a routine serology test that then - or not routine. One that is say quantitative or tittered and makes a correlation to a neutralizing reference method. And notes that at a certain titer or a certain cut off that there's a certain overlap between the detection of antibodies in a patient and a high level of neutralizing antibodies. And so that's not a direct sort of neutralizing antibody assay. And then there are various ways to do this testing more directly and that is often also semi-quant or quantitative in order to make that assessment. It may be that a minimum titer is required for the significant neutralizing antibodies present. In both cases you want to compare ultimately to a validated reference method. How do we know that an assay is truly neutralizing or correlates to a truly neutralizing antibody? And then there's the added addition of making this semi-quant or quantitative. And so, for semi-quants or quantitative assays, I don't believe our current templates go into a lot of detail about how to validate that. So, we do ask you that you approach us and describe that. But in many cases, in order to be - to have a good precision and accuracy FDA Townhall around quantitation, that there is a calibrator or calibration that goes into effect. And then of course an appropriate validation of that quantification portion of the assay. So that's about all I can say right now, are the things that we're thinking about. For more details, you know, ask questions. The more details you can provide, sending an email to our template email address, the better, so we can provide more information. This is a relatively new area of review for us and before we provide a more definitive feedback and recommendations that would be put into a template, we want to understand the assays that we first see in submissions, understand their performance, understand that we can establish truth to a reference assay, and develop the recommendation based on those early applications. And then we'll, presuming that there'll be more and more, we'll make a template available, a template addition available for the them, OK.

QA Block 2-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How is the FDA going to determine titers as part of the assay for neutralizing antibodies?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA welcomes EUA applications for neutralizing antibody tests. Two general types of assays are considered: one correlating to a neutralizing reference method and another for directly measuring neutralizing activity, often semi-quantitative or quantitative. Validation typically requires comparison to a reference method, potential calibration, and establishing precision. Current templates have limited details, so applicants should consult FDA directly during submission.

And I'm not saying that's easy to establish or that that's taken as truth right now and just talking about the potential for such tasks. But we certainly don't have any recommendations yet for how you would FDA Townhall validate that. So, anybody who is interested in developing a saliva-based antibody test, it's not so much a serology test that we usually think about it, as a blood-based or a blood-derived anolyte.

#### 5. Regulations for Importing and Selling RUO Test Kits

QA Block 5-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the challenges with obtaining FDA clearance to import and sell RUO (Research Use Only) rapid serology kits for research use only in the US?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Distributing RUO test kits in the US is challenging, particularly complete kits, since they should not be sent to clinical labs as RUO. The FDA advises reviewing its guidance, which clarifies that RUO-labeled products cannot be promoted for clinical laboratory-developed test validation.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the challenges with obtaining FDA clearance to import and sell RUO (Research Use Only) rapid serology kits for research use only in the US?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. So that's a potentially challenging area and Toby, do you - are you prepared to address this, because you've thought a lot about this. Yes. So RUO is a little challenging especially for complete test kits. Complete test kits should really not be distributed to clinical laboratories as an RUO. I would encourage you to take a look at the guidance document that we have on distribution of IVD products labeled for RUO. And as noted in that guidance document, it's not appropriate to label a product as RUO and then promote it to clinical laboratories with the intent that the laboratory validate the test and offer FDA Townhall it for clinical diagnostic use as a laboratory-developed test.

QA Block 5-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Would we need to provide any official notification to the FDA prior to submitting a pre-EUA to import and sell RUO kits?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA considers this a gray area and encourages submitting an EUA if data is ready. While notification is possible, submitting EUA data directly is recommended.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Would we need to provide any official notification to the FDA prior to submitting a pre-EUA to import and sell RUO kits?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. So, I mean I think that's a gray area. We're not encouraging labs to buy RUO kits for this purpose. There are now some authorized kits that they can use. And there are notified kits that they can use and to go ahead and purchase RUO when there are so many notified tests and already quite a few authorized tests, doesn't really make a lot of sense to us. So, if you've got, you know, data for a EUA submission I would just encourage you to, you know, notify us if you want and or just submit the data.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: Yes, multiplex testing requirements can be addressed during the pre-EUA process. FDA templates provide guidance for validation by isotype and antigen, but specifics on aggregation and overall data reporting depend on the developer. Extensive interaction with the FDA may not be necessary if templates are followed.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Should multiplex testing requirements be discussed during the pre-EUA process to gain better clarity on requirements for multiplexing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. The more you can propose what your validation would be the easier. But really, I mean our templates are pretty good already for individual antigens. And the fact that you would report out individually it just matters how you would like. And then the validation could be done individually and separately, you know, by isotype and by antigen. But then it also depends on how you might want to aggregate that data and report it overall. That's probably the biggest question and that's not a super important question at the beginning, as long as each isotype and antigen are properly validated and performed well. And, you know, to any extent that you report something individually we will look at that individual performance and make sure it meets our minimum specs, and those are pretty well laid out in the template.

But a lot of collection devices are 510k exempt so they should be registered and listed and have a quality system and be following FDA regulations. But swabs and certain types of media are 510k exempt. Some others are not. As you mentioned, VTM does generally require 510k and we have worked with some newer manufacturers of VTM on different issues that have come up there. And we're working on ways to address that. And so, we are accepting EUA requests for specimen collection devices. But it is important to note that we are trying to, you know, figure out the best way to handle the issue of unauthorized collection devices. And right now, what we're advising companies, especially FDA Townhall saliva collection devices have been the area that we've had the most discussion around with developers and with manufacturers. And we're advising them at this point to refer to the home collection template. While not everything in there would be applicable, there is a lot of information there about what we would be looking for in terms of validation from the collection device side of things.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are there additional 510k requirements that might eventually apply to EUA-authorized specimen collection kits?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is addressing challenges with unauthorized collection devices and notes that many are 510k exempt but should still comply with registration, listing, and quality systems. Some components, like viral transport media (VTM), typically require 510k clearance. Companies are advised to refer to the home collection template for guidance on validation requirements.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are there additional 510k requirements that might eventually apply to EUA-authorized specimen collection kits?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Sure. So, I think we discussed this briefly last week on the town hall also because we agree the issue of unauthorized collection devices is challenging. And there's also a desire by developers to expand sample collection to new specimen types like saliva and I know that's not one that you mentioned. But a lot of collection devices are 510k exempt so they should be registered and listed and have a quality system and be following FDA regulations.

And like I said earlier, you don't need that as long as you're not claiming that. But if you're reaching out to businesses and saying, we want to have an FDA-authorized test that the FDA says is okay to screen asymptomatic patients, then it would require asymptomatic studies. And if you already have an EUA authorized assay or if you've already done the EUA-authorized work of 30 positives and 30 negatives and NP and cross-validated, too, and you've done a paired study with saliva, and all those need to be on natural patients, not contrived. Actual patients, you know, an actual patient sample, a swab sample. FDA Townhall Then, if you want to add to that, the asymptomatic screening claim to an already authorized assay, it does require 20 - the first 20 in a, samples that are consecutive, asymptomatic samples, compared to another - not yours, to another EUA-authorized high sensitivity assay, molecular assay.

VERBATIM QUESTION: What does the FDA mean by "claiming asymptomatic testing" and how does it differ from general screening?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Are you going to make - are you going to advertise, claim, make the statement that you have validated asymptomatic testing? Or, you know, because the FDA currently if you get an EUA for - a typical EUA says that testing on patients suspected of having COVID, we had stated that it's for prescription that if you get an order from a clinician on a patient it doesn't matter whether they're asymptomatic or symptomatic.

#### 11. FDA Guidelines for Serology Assay Applications and EUA Requirements

QA Block 11-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Do all three applications of serology assays (diagnostic, screening, surveillance) need an EUA authorization, or can surveillance be done with a research use only test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Surveillance with a serology test can be done using a research use only (RUO) test if results are not reported back to individual patients. This is outside FDA's purview for this pandemic.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Do all three applications of serology assays (diagnostic, screening, surveillance) need an EUA authorization, or can surveillance be done with a research use only test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Surveillance would be looking at sero-positivity with a serology test. That, we have publicly stated and it's on our FAQ, that surveillance, if it's not reported back to individual patients, it's certainly something that is not something that the FDA, at least for this pandemic, is - has purview over. So, it can be RUO for that purpose, for surveillance, not reporting results back to individual patients.

REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 11-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does screening for groups of people returning to work or other situations, which involves individual tests, require EUA authorization or is it treated like surveillance?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA considers diagnostic testing and screening, including reporting results to individual patients, under its jurisdiction, requiring EUA authorization. Surveillance, unlike screening, can be done with non-EUA assays if appropriately validated. Screening for asymptomatic individuals, such as for returning to work or school, falls under FDA authority and requires an EUA as it involves individual testing.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does screening for groups of people returning to work or other situations, which involves individual tests, require EUA authorization or is it treated like surveillance?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Diagnostic testing and screening are - and reporting results back to individual patients, at a high level, are under the FDA's purview. Surveillance can be done with a non-EUA assay. We ask that it be validated to the same level that an EUA assay would be validated, so that the data that's coming out of that surveillance testing can be relied upon for surveillance information. But if you're screening individual patients who are not showing symptoms for workplace, return to work, school or return to school, that is something that's very clearly under FDA jurisdiction, and will require an EUA for that. It would be challenging for a serology test to be used in that manner, because you would have to presume that not only do you detect antibodies, but that antibody equals immunity. And while we're open to developers that want to come in and make claims about immunity, the study design to demonstrate immunity is - could be rather challenging, and we're open to study designs that would show that. I'd also refer you to all the CDC guidance on the use of serology, and for this purpose.

QA Block 2-6
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the specific requirements for FDA validation of semi-quantitative or quantitative neutralizing antibody assays?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is open to EUA applications for neutralizing antibody tests. These tests should either correlate quantitative results with a validated reference method or provide direct neutralizing antibody measurements. FDA considers calibration and validation critical for semi-quantitative or quantitative assays. Currently, templates lack guidance, so FDA recommends applicants provide detailed descriptions and questions via email to help refine FDA's evaluation process.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the specific requirements for FDA validation of semi-quantitative or quantitative neutralizing antibody assays?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, so we're very welcome of EUA applications for neutralizing antibody tests. Obviously, there's health determined among other things, folks who might be good donors for convalescent plasma. And there are two types of assays that include say neutralizing claims. One is a routine serology test that then - or not routine. One that is say quantitative or tittered and makes a correlation to a neutralizing reference method. And notes that at a certain titer or a certain cut off that there's a certain overlap between the detection of antibodies in a patient and a high level of neutralizing antibodies. And so that's not a direct sort of neutralizing antibody assay. And then there are various ways to do this testing more directly and that is often also semi-quant or quantitative in order to make that assessment. It may be that a minimum titer is required for the significant neutralizing antibodies present. In both cases you want to compare ultimately to a validated reference method. How do we know that an assay is truly neutralizing or correlates to a truly neutralizing antibody? And then there's the added addition of making this semi-quant or quantitative. And so, for semi-quants or quantitative assays, I don't believe our current templates go into a lot of detail about how to validate that. So, we do ask you that you approach us and describe that. But in many cases, in order to be - to have a good precision and accuracy FDA Townhall around quantitation, that there is a calibrator or calibration that goes into effect. And then of course an appropriate validation of that quantification portion of the assay. So that's about all I can say right now, are the things that we're thinking about. For more details, you know, ask questions. The more details you can provide, sending an email to our template email address, the better, so we can provide more information. This is a relatively new area of review for us and before we provide a more definitive feedback and recommendations that would be put into a template, we want to understand the assays that we first see in submissions, understand their performance, understand that we can establish truth to a reference assay, and develop the recommendation based on those early applications. And then we'll, presuming that there'll be more and more, we'll make a template available, a template addition available for the them, OK.

QA Block 3-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Have any EUAs for neutralizing antibodies been accepted yet?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA has not yet authorized any assays for neutralizing antibodies, though there is strong interest and submissions are welcome.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Have any EUAs for neutralizing antibodies been accepted yet?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So, we have not authorized any assays for correlation or actual neutralizing antibodies. There is very strong interest and we welcome them now of course. And I can't really say any more details other than that.

TOPICS: EUAs for neutralizing antibodies, FDA assay authorization
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 4-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What validation criteria should developers propose for FDA review of saliva-based antibody tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA has not authorized saliva-based antibody tests yet and is still considering validation criteria. Developers are encouraged to propose ideas or protocols for validation, focusing on performance and correlation, especially with IgA.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What validation criteria should developers propose for FDA review of saliva-based antibody tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So, this would also be a new area for us. So, we haven't authorized any yet. And trying to understand what the performance should be and how you establish the validation is still something that we're noodling on. You know, there is the capability of looking in saliva for - specifically perhaps for IgA. And it could be that IgA detection and maybe in saliva, could correlate well with some types of immunity. And I'm not saying that's easy to establish or that that's taken as truth right now and just talking about the potential for such tasks. But we certainly don't have any recommendations yet for how you would FDA Townhall validate that. So, anybody who is interested in developing a saliva-based antibody test, it's not so much a serology test that we usually think about it, as a blood-based or a blood-derived anolyte. But it's, you know, it could have importance. We're not going to discount that. So, we would welcome ideas on how to validate and proposals. And we'll take a look at them.
SPEAKER QUESTION: David Houg
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Saliva-based antibody tests, Validation criteria, IgA for immunity
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 11-7
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does a serology test that presumes antibody equals immunity need additional study designs and FDA authorization?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: A serology test presuming that antibodies equal immunity would require robust study designs to demonstrate immunity, and this could be challenging. Developers are welcome to propose such studies, and FDA references CDC guidance for this purpose.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does a serology test that presumes antibody equals immunity need additional study designs and FDA authorization?
VERBATIM ANSWER: It would be challenging for a serology test to be used in that manner, because you would have to presume that not only do you detect antibodies, but that antibody equals immunity. And while we're open to developers that want to come in and make claims about immunity, the study design to demonstrate immunity is - could be rather challenging, and we're open to study designs that would show that. I'd also refer you to all the CDC guidance on the use of serology, and for this purpose.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: serology tests, antibodies and immunity, study requirements
REVIEW FLAG: False
