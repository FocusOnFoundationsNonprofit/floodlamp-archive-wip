#### 1. Monkeypox and COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Updates

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the steps required for monkeypox LDT developers to notify the FDA by the October 13 deadline?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Monkeypox LDT developers must send an email notification to FDA by October 13th, 30 days after the monkeypox test policy guidance publication. The notification applies to validated single-site PCR tests using lesion swab samples without submitting additional data or an EUA request.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the steps required for monkeypox LDT developers to notify the FDA by the October 13 deadline?
VERBATIM ANSWER: First up is a reminder of the October 13 '22 deadline for the monkeypox. It is 30 days. That date is 30 days after the publication of the monkeypox test policy guidance. This is the deadline for both LDT notifications to be sent to the FDA and also for experienced developers, kit test developers, who informed FDA by email of their intent to submit an EUA request for a monkeypox diagnostic test. So that's the first key important update is to be aware of date. The second update is that primarily for monkeypox LDT developers. I'd like to remind callers today that the FDA does not expect an EUA request for certain validated monkeypox diagnostic LDT tests that are developed and performed in a single app that use PCR and the only sample size is lesion swab samples. Lesion swab samples are broadly defined as any swab from a lesion that could be monkeypox. FDA just expects a notification by email with no data, no review, no decision by the FDA on an application, and then no EUA authorization.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Monkeypox LDT notification, FDA deadline, EUA process
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are there circumstances where an EUA request is not expected for monkeypox diagnostic tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA does not expect an EUA request for validated monkeypox LDTs performed in a single app using PCR with lesion swab samples as the only sample type. Only email notification is required without data, review, or EUA authorization.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are there circumstances where an EUA request is not expected for monkeypox diagnostic tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The FDA does not expect an EUA request for certain validated monkeypox diagnostic LDT tests that are developed and performed in a single app that use PCR and the only sample size is lesion swab samples. Lesion swab samples are broadly defined as any swab from a lesion that could be monkeypox. FDA just expects a notification by email with no data, no review, no decision by the FDA on an application, and then no EUA authorization.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: EUA exemptions for monkeypox tests, FDA notification requirements
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the FDA's enforcement discretion policy for monkeypox LDTs after the EUA test declaration?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA applies a narrow enforcement discretion policy for monkeypox single-site PCR lesion swab LDTs both before and after the EUA test declaration.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the FDA's enforcement discretion policy for monkeypox LDTs after the EUA test declaration?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Outside of a declared emergency and prior to the EUA test declaration for monkeypox, the FDA generally has to exercise enforcement discretion for LDT. And for this subset of monkeypox diagnostic tests, single-site PCR lesion swab, the FDA has also implemented a narrow policy of enforcement discretion after the EUA test declaration.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Monkeypox LDTs, Enforcement Discretion, EUA Declaration
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the appropriate uses of the CDC-cleared NVO orthopox assay for validating monkeypox tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends using contrived or clinical samples for monkeypox test validation. The CDC-cleared NVO assay may provide leftover samples for validation, but its primary use should be for diagnostic testing.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the appropriate uses of the CDC-cleared NVO orthopox assay for validating monkeypox tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The FDA's current validation recommendations for monkeypox diagnostic tests include the use of contrived samples when it may be difficult to obtain positive clinical samples for validation. If you have access to clinical samples, you may validate using your clinical agreement study with an appropriate comparator as described in the template. As discussed in the town hall last week, the CDC performed by the LRN labs and the five commercial labs that are currently the only-- and that test is currently the only appropriate comparator until we have additional EUA authorizations that make additional appropriate comparators available. The CDC has asked that their tests primarily be reserved for diagnostic testing, not validation of testing. The laboratories performing the CDC assay may provide leftover samples, including the test results and Ct or cycle threshold values that are outputted by the cleared test that other test developers can use for validation. So we are encouraging that if you want to validate using real samples that you obtain samples that have been tested with the CDC NVO cleared assay. However, we are not recommending asking those laboratories to use the CDC to test clinical samples you may have acquired elsewhere since the testing will be potentially solely for assay validation and not to diagnose the patient.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: CDC NVO assay use, Monkeypox test validation, Diagnostic vs validation use
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-5
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can laboratories provide leftover CDC NVO assay tested samples for validation purposes?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Laboratories performing the CDC assay can provide leftover samples, including test results and Ct values, for validation purposes. FDA encourages obtaining samples tested with the CDC NVO cleared assay for validation.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can laboratories provide leftover CDC NVO assay tested samples for validation purposes?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The laboratories performing the CDC assay may provide leftover samples, including the test results and Ct or cycle threshold values that are outputted by the cleared test that other test developers can use for validation. So we are encouraging that if you want to validate using real samples that you obtain samples that have been tested with the CDC NVO cleared assay.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: CDC NVO assay, Validation samples, Leftover samples
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-6
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are test developers allowed to request new clinical samples to be tested with the CDC assay for validation purposes?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA encourages using leftover samples tested with the CDC assay but advises against requesting new tests solely for assay validation.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are test developers allowed to request new clinical samples to be tested with the CDC assay for validation purposes?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The FDA's current validation recommendations for monkeypox diagnostic tests include the use of contrived samples when it may be difficult to obtain positive clinical samples for validation. If you have access to clinical samples, you may validate using your clinical agreement study with an appropriate comparator as described in the template.

QA Block 1-7
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What should developers know about the recent updates to the COVID test policy guidance issued on September 27th?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The COVID test policy was updated on September 27th to reduce priorities for EUA request reviews and to recommend a shift to traditional premarket review pathways for COVID-19 test types. Resources like the press release and updated FAQs are available.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What should developers know about the recent updates to the COVID test policy guidance issued on September 27th?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yesterday, September 27th, we did update the COVID test policy. There's a link on this slide to the press release and to the reissued guidance as well as updated frequently asked questions that may be helpful for developers who are looking to see how things will be handled moving forward. So the main point of this guidance update was to indicate new reduced priorities for reviewing EUA requests for COVID and to encourage developers to seek traditional premarket review for most COVID-19 test types.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: COVID test policy update, EUA request changes, Premarket review pathways
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-8
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Which types of COVID-19 diagnostic tests are now prioritized for EUA review by the FDA?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is prioritizing EUA review for COVID-19 diagnostic tests that have significant public health benefits, address unmet needs, or involve supplemental requests fulfilling authorization conditions or significant public health modifications. Additionally, requests supported by U.S. government stakeholders will also be reviewed.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Which types of COVID-19 diagnostic tests are now prioritized for EUA review by the FDA?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So these are the types of COVID-19 tests that we do intend to focus our review. And generally, that's going to be EUA requests and supplemental EUA requests, so supplements to previously authorized tests, that are for diagnostic tests likely to have a significant benefit to public health, diagnostic tests that are likely to fulfill an unmet need. And then for supplemental requests, so modifications, those will be when the request is intended to fulfill a condition of authorization or if the modification would significantly benefit public health or fulfill an unmet need. And then as before, we will continue to review EUA requests that are from or supported by a US government stakeholder.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: COVID-19 EUA prioritization, Test benefit and unmet needs, Supplemental requests
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-9
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What does the FDA recommend for developers considering the traditional premarket review pathway?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA encourages developers to consider traditional premarket review pathways (510(k) or de novo) and emphasizes the higher evidence requirements compared to EUAs. Developers are advised to submit pre-submissions to discuss validation approaches and seek specific recommendations via email or pre-sub meetings. Developers unsure about their review priorities should contact the FDA.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What does the FDA recommend for developers considering the traditional premarket review pathway?
VERBATIM ANSWER: And then beyond that, we are encouraging the use of the traditional premarket review pathways. So as I mentioned before, that's de novo and 510k. And then it's important to note that the statutory requirements for the level of evidence for authorization under a traditional premarket review pathway is higher than the statutory requirements for emergency use authorization. So we would encourage you to submit a pre-submission to discuss your validation approaches. And we can also provide recommendations that are specific to a test developer situation. And we can do that both by email if they're simple questions or through pre-Subs for the more complex questions. And if you're unsure whether your test may be prioritized for review or if you should consider a traditional premarket review pathway, we encourage you to reach out through the mailbox to have that discussion.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: Traditional premarket review, FDA recommendations, Validation approaches
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-10
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the distinction between EUA statutory requirements and traditional premarket approval requirements?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The statutory requirements for the level of evidence are higher for traditional premarket review pathways than for emergency use authorization.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the distinction between EUA statutory requirements and traditional premarket approval requirements?
VERBATIM ANSWER: It's important to note that the statutory requirements for the level of evidence for authorization under a traditional premarket review pathway is higher than the statutory requirements for emergency use authorization.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: EUA vs. traditional premarket approval, regulatory requirements
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-11
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the conditions under which modified COVID-19 diagnostic tests require a new EUA or traditional authorization?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Modified COVID-19 diagnostic tests generally require a new EUA or traditional marketing authorization unless the modification was made under previous policies, fulfills a condition of authorization, or certain validated modifications by high complexity CLIA labs. FDA encourages traditional premarket review for modifications beyond prioritized scopes.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the conditions under which modified COVID-19 diagnostic tests require a new EUA or traditional authorization?
VERBATIM ANSWER: In general, we now expect modified tests to be authorized under an EUA or a traditional marketing authorization before being distributed or offered. We generally don't intend to object to continued implementation during FDA review for modifications that were made prior to yesterday's guidance update under the policies that were in the previous version of the guidance. And we also continue to not object to implementation without a new EUA of certain validated modifications made by a high complexity CLIA certified laboratory to an authorized COVID-19 diagnostic test. So that is similar to the policy that has been in place in previous versions of the guidance. We do, as I mentioned, intend to review supplements for previously authorized tests when the request is intended to fulfill a condition of authorization or when the modification is within the priorities that are outlined in the guidance. And then some modifications that are beyond the scope of the priorities, we encourage submitting that modification through the traditional premarket review pathway.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: Modified COVID-19 tests, EUA requirements, Premarket review
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-12
CLARIFIED QUESTION: For ongoing EUA reviews, how does the FDA handle unauthorized COVID-19 diagnostic tests already being marketed or distributed?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA generally allows unauthorized COVID-19 tests under review to continue being distributed if they were previously listed on notification lists or submitted as EUA requests. However, developers must cease distribution within 15 calendar days if the FDA declines review or authorization.
VERBATIM QUESTION: For ongoing EUA reviews, how does the FDA handle unauthorized COVID-19 diagnostic tests already being marketed or distributed?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We are generally continuing to not intend to object, which means that we don't have any concern with the continued distribution or offering of the test while under FDA review. And that's for tests that are on one of the notification lists on our website at the time of issuance of the guidance, so as of yesterday as well as the LDTs that were offered prior to November 15, 2021 where an EUA request was submitted to FDA under that policy described in that 2021 version of the guidance. So those are the EUA requests that should have been received by January of 2022. And then generally, we expect that developers have or will cease distributing, marketing, and offering their tests within 15 calendar days if they receive a notice from FDA that we declined to review, declined to issue, or otherwise declined or decide not to authorize the test for any reason.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)

CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is not likely to request additional studies for serial testing under EUA due to available NIH data but recommends pre-submission discussions for pursuing 510k applications.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Will the FDA require additional clinical study results under a 510k for serial testing recommendations with at-home COVID-19 antigen tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So we have discussed a bit on previous town halls that FDA continues to work to reflect the need for serial testing in antigen test authorizations. The results of the NIH-supported UMass study have been published. And FDA plans to use this data in support of serial testing claims. One of the goals of the study was to provide broadly applicable data to avoid the need for individual developers to perform large and expensive tests-- or expensive studies, rather. And so at this time, the FDA is not likely to request additional studies to support serial testing under EUA. And as I noted previously, we do continue to recommend submitting a pre-submission to discuss your proposed clinical validation strategies if you intend to pursue a 510k.

#### 7. Clarifications on FDA Pre-EUA Test Review Process

QA Block 7-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can you clarify if the pre-EUAs that have already been submitted and are under review prior to this announcement will still remain in the queue?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Pre-EUAs submitted before the update will not stay in the queue unless they meet new priority criteria. Developers should consider converting pre-EUAs to a pre-submission for traditional authorization.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can you clarify if the pre-EUAs that have already been submitted and are under review prior to this announcement will still remain in the queue?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So Toby can back me up on this. But EUAs that are in the queue have all the data relevant to the submission. And they will remain in the queue through the completion of the review and the decision made on that. Pre-EUAs are designed to provide feedback on test development and are not designed for a submission for authorization. So those with pending pre-EUAs, if they wish to make a submission to the FDA, it would be through the traditional route unless it meets some of the unusual conditions for continued EUA review. That can be assessed through a pre-EUA to determine whether we would at this point accept an EUA submission. So if a test developer wants to market a test that isn't one of the unusual categories that we would still review, I would recommend that you convert that pre-EUA, those questions, into a Q-sub or pre-sub submission to the FDA to find out what the expectations are for a full authorization submission.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA considers new technologies as anything valuable to the pandemic or the ongoing COVID emergency that isn't a repeat or “me too” product. For instance, breath tests are a novel technology where only one authorization exists, and the FDA is accepting additional submissions for such examples. Technologies can be reviewed through a pre-EUA submission to determine eligibility.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can you elaborate on and provide more examples of the meaning of new technologies and fulfilling an unmet need in the context of the COVID-19 re-prioritization policy?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's anything that would be valuable to the pandemic or to the ongoing COVID emergency now and isn't a “me too” product. For several categories of tests, we have multiple examples of them. One is new technology where we only have one authorization that is open for EUA submissions is the breath test. We authorized one breath test. And we're willing to accept additional breath tests. At some point, we may have more than enough breath tests. And the policy may be updated again. But that's a concrete example of a new technology where we only have one authorization. So where we have plenty of tests already authorized, and an additional test would be a “me too” test, that's what we're steering away from now.

And we're just refining that, so that it goes as smoothly as possible. Like Tim said, we do want to be able to cover all developers at the same time. So that's something we are addressing. And when we do reach out, we want to make sure that everyone has the information simultaneously. So that's where we are in the process right now.

#### 13. Clarifying Over-the-Counter COVID-19 Test Definitions

QA Block 13-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the Agency mean that over-the-counter multianalyte antigen tests are non-prescription, for example, for a test that's visually read, does not have a companion app, but is labeled for symptomatic users only?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA clarified that 'over-the-counter' is synonymous with 'non-prescription' and differs from prescription home use tests that require a prescription.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the Agency mean that over-the-counter multianalyte antigen tests are non-prescription, for example, for a test that's visually read, does not have a companion app, but is labeled for symptomatic users only?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Just to clarify some from a definition perspective, over-the-counter is, by definition, non- prescription. There is prescription home use, which is another sort of category of home use tests that do require a prescription. But over-the-counter is essentially synonymous with non-prescription.

#### 14. Evaluating User Comprehension in COVID Test Interpretation

QA Block 14-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is interpretation of a low positive result required for usability comprehension studies involving COVID tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends that usability and comprehension evaluations include tests involving faint lines as they are important for assessing edge performance.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is interpretation of a low positive result required for usability comprehension studies involving COVID tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Right. So user comprehension, of course, is reading the test. I think there's an element of both usability and comprehension. And I believe we do have some recommendations for what should be included in those studies. Of course, a bright line or a very dark easy to read line, perhaps, may have different usability or user comprehension than a faint line. So in general, we would want to have a comprehension of usability evaluated on the edges of the performance of the test. So certainly, faint lines would be helpful to evaluate those types of studies.

#### 15. Clarifications on New COVID Testing Guidance and Exceptions

QA Block 15-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Will the new EUA guidance apply to submissions already in the queue or only to new EUA submissions?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA will continue reviewing submissions already in the queue to determine their paths based on priorities and review status. Each submission will receive an individual decision, and no broad decisions will apply to all pending submissions.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Will the new EUA guidance apply to submissions already in the queue or only to new EUA submissions?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah. So submissions that are currently pending will remain in the queue until we respond to the developer. So we will be making our way through those to determine whether or not they will proceed towards authorization or whether we will decline to issue. Those decisions will be made based on a combination of the priorities and where they are in the review. Something that's not going to meet the new priorities but was a couple of days away from being authorized, we're probably going to move forward with that. Something that was sort of sitting in the queue and does not meet the priorities, we would have to consider whether there are other factors that would apply there. So you sit tight, if you will. And you will hear an individual decision for each submission that's in-house. The information about those tests that are in queue was really intended to assure that there's not a blanket decision being made on all of the submissions that are in the queue.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the new guidance apply to over-the-counter COVID home testing in addition to lab-developed tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: I think you may have misread that. I think the language that you're referring to, that it does not apply to home tests, was specifically on the slide about the State Authorization Policy. So that is only for that policy where a specific state that's listed on the FDA's notification list is authorizing laboratories within that state to develop and perform COVID-19 tests. And that's done without any submission to FDA. And that specific State Authorization Policy does not apply to the home tests or tests with home specimen collection. Yeah. Just to clarify that exception, it is for LDTs only. It is for LDTs run in high complexity CLIA labs and only for labs that are in the state that the FDA has allowed to do that. And it does not include any testing in the home either, self-collection in the home or a home test of any sort.

VERBATIM ANSWER: FDA continues to work to reflect the need for serial testing in antigen test authorizations. The results of the NIH-supported UMass study have been published. And FDA plans to use this data in support of serial testing claims. One of the goals of the study was to provide broadly applicable data to avoid the need for individual developers to perform large and expensive tests-- or expensive studies, rather. And so at this time, the FDA is not likely to request additional studies to support serial testing under EUA. And as I noted previously, we do continue to recommend submitting a pre-submission to discuss your proposed clinical validation strategies if you intend to pursue a 510k.

QA Block 8-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is meant by a successful EUA request?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: A successful EUA request means being issued an EUA following submission of the EUA request.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is meant by a successful EUA request?
VERBATIM ANSWER: It's a similar language in both guidances I believe at this point. So a successful EUA request would be having been issued an EUA following submission of an EUA request.

QA Block 9-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the FDA accept clinical study data from outside of the US for point of care devices for monkeypox?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA indicates it is possible to accept clinical study data from outside the US for monkeypox devices, but challenges exist due to the unavailability of necessary comparator tests. FDA recommends submitting a pre-EUA for specific questions.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA accept clinical study data from outside of the US for point of care devices for monkeypox?
VERBATIM ANSWER: That's possible. The comparator tests that the FDA recognizes at the moment is the CDC NVO orthopox test that is FDA cleared. So I don't believe that that's available for this kind of study. So that would be the challenge with that. But I think this is a very specific question. And you can come in with a pre-EUA for that question.

QA Block 15-8
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are home collection or home testing products excluded from the State Authorization Policy?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The State Authorization Policy does not apply to home tests or tests involving home specimen collection.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are home collection or home testing products excluded from the State Authorization Policy?
VERBATIM ANSWER: I think you may have misread that. I think the language that you're referring to, that it does not apply to home tests, was specifically on the slide about the State Authorization Policy. So that is only for that policy where a specific state that's listed on the FDA's notification list is authorizing laboratories within that state to develop and perform COVID-19 tests. And that's done without any submission to FDA. And that specific State Authorization Policy does not apply to the home tests or tests with home specimen collection.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Jennifer Stanford
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: State Authorization Policy, Home testing exclusion, COVID-19 diagnostics
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 17-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Would the currently EUA approved multi-panel tests count as a predicate device?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: EUA-approved tests cannot serve as predicate devices, as predicates must be FDA-cleared. However, EUA-authorized tests may serve as comparators with FDA approval through a Q-sub or pre-submission process.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Would the currently EUA approved multi-panel tests count as a predicate device?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So the predicate device has to be something that FDA cleared. And that's just the formality of the submission. I think what you're talking about is a comparison device. The current predicate may not serve well as a comparator. And that's why we have expressed flexibility in using EUA authorized tests as a comparator. However, we do recommend that you check in with the FDA through a Q-sub or pre-submission to make sure that the comparator is appropriate for your test. Not all EUA authorized tests may be appropriate. And so that will reduce your risk of doing a study if you go ahead and are assured of that and any other questions you might have about your development of your test for submission.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Rohit Polavarapu
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: EUA-approved tests, 510k submission, comparator devices
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 17-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the FDA's recommendations for using EUA authorized tests as comparators?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA allows the use of EUA authorized tests as comparators but recommends confirming their appropriateness through a Q-sub or pre-submission process to minimize risks.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the FDA's recommendations for using EUA authorized tests as comparators?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The current predicate may not serve well as a comparator. And that's why we have expressed flexibility in using EUA authorized tests as a comparator. However, we do recommend that you check in with the FDA through a Q-sub or pre-submission to make sure that the comparator is appropriate for your test.
