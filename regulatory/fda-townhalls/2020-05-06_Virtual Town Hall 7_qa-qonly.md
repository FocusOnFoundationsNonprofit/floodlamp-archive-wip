#### 1. FDA Updates on COVID-19 Serological Testing Guidelines

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the details of the FDA's updated antibody test policy for commercial manufacturers?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA updated its policy for COVID-19 antibody tests, requiring commercial manufacturers to submit emergency use authorization requests with validation within 10 days of notifying the FDA or the policy publication date.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the details of the FDA's updated antibody test policy for commercial manufacturers?
VERBATIM ANSWER: That's why earlier this week we did update our policy and guidance on COVID-19 antibody tests. Most notably we are changing the policy as it applies to commercial manufacturers, those kit developers out there right now. Under this new policy, the FDA has outlined expectations for antibody test developers, including of course kit manufacturers, which will - who will submit emergency use authorization requests with their validation within ten days from the date they either notify the FDA of their validation testing or from the date of the publication of the policy, which was Monday this week, whichever is later.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: FDA antibody test policies, Emergency Use Authorization, Validation requirements
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What validation and performance expectations must be submitted for serological tests under the new policy?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The new FDA guidance requires serological test developers, including kit manufacturers, to submit EUA requests with validation results within ten days. Performance expectations include overall sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 95%; for broken-down isotypes, IgG sensitivity must be at least 90% and IgM at least 70%, with specificity remaining at 95%.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What validation and performance expectations must be submitted for serological tests under the new policy?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Under this new policy, the FDA has outlined expectations for antibody test developers, including of course kit manufacturers, which will - who will submit emergency use authorization requests with their validation within ten days from the date they either notify the FDA of their validation testing or from the date of the publication of the policy, which was Monday this week, whichever is later. ... So at a high level, the performance expectation for serological tests going forward is that the overall sensitivity, whether it's not broken up isotype or a single is a single isotype of combined is 90%, 9-0 percent. And the combined or overall specificity should be at least 95%. If isotypes broken out, the expectation is that the specificity should be at least 95% per each isotype and then sensitivity, the expectation is that IgG, if reported out separately, would have a sensitivity of at least 90% and then if IgM is reported out separately, that the sensitivity for IgM remains at - should be at 70%.

QA Block 1-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What changes were made to the regulatory flexibility originally provided to serological test developers?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA updated its policy by requiring commercial manufacturers of serological tests to submit emergency use authorization requests with validation within ten days. Originally, regulatory flexibility was provided during the emergency, but the policy has now been revised to include specific performance expectations.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What changes were made to the regulatory flexibility originally provided to serological test developers?

When we issued our original serological test policy in mid-March, it was critical that the FDA provide regulatory flexibility for serological test developers, given the nature of the public health emergency and also the understanding that tests were not to be used for COVID-19 diagnosis, a fact that remains true until today and through today. We have authorized quite a few serological tests now through the EUA process and so really at this time it was appropriate to take another look at that policy and to make a change. And that change is of course, as mentioned, that we expect all kit manufacturers to come in within the ten-day period, and our performance expectations are also laid out in this updated policy guidance.

TOPICS: Regulatory updates for serological tests, Emergency Use Authorizations, Performance expectations
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-5
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the specific performance thresholds for sensitivity and specificity for serological tests going forward?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA's performance expectations for serological tests are at least 90% overall sensitivity and at least 95% overall specificity. If isotypes are separated, specificity remains at 95% for each isotype. Sensitivity should be at least 90% for IgG and 70% for IgM.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the specific performance thresholds for sensitivity and specificity for serological tests going forward?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So at a high level, the performance expectation for serological tests going forward is that the overall sensitivity, whether it's not broken up isotype or a single is a single isotype of combined is 90%, 9-0 percent.

REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-6
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the FDA's recommendations for confirmatory serological testing when specificity is a concern?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends using a second confirmatory serological test with a different antigen to improve specificity, potentially enhancing the likelihood of true positives. However, even two tests may yield combined false positives as no test is entirely specific.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the FDA's recommendations for confirmatory serological testing when specificity is a concern?
VERBATIM ANSWER: As has been mentioned previously, if it's important to know whether an antibody test really is specific that a second confirmatory serological test utilizing a different antigen should be considered as well. The combined dual-positive results requirement, if you follow that path, if you choose to follow that path, greatly - has the potential to greatly increase the specificity. In the end, it does increase substantially, in theory, the positive predictive value of a positive result that is the likelihood that a positive result is a true positive. There's still the chance that it - that even after two serological tests you could still have a combined false positive result, given that few, if any, tests are 100% specific. However, this confirmation test, if used, should greatly increase the predictive power of serological tests, if that's important for a given patient or for a population study.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Confirmatory serological testing, Specificity improvement, Dual-positive results
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-7
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What factors will the FDA consider in making regulatory determinations for serological tests, including data sources?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA considers the totality of evidence for serological tests, including data from test developers, results from NCI testing, publications, and government agency reports.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What factors will the FDA consider in making regulatory determinations for serological tests, including data sources?
VERBATIM ANSWER: When we make regulatory decisions going forward around serological tests we will of course as always take in the totality of the evidence, presented both by the test developer, if testing is done at NCI, those results, and other information that we may glean about the performance of a given test. That may be publications, reports from other government agencies, et cetera.

Testing asymptomatic individuals is at the healthcare provider's discretion. Tests must be validated for the intended population. Developers interested in screening asymptomatic individuals should contact FDA for validation guidance.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What new updates did the FDA add to the FAQ page regarding molecular testing and the screening of asymptomatic individuals?
VERBATIM ANSWER: I did want to briefly mention that we added other updates to our FAQ page. We have updated the page to address of molecular tests at least, the testing or screening of a symptomatic individual. So that should have been posted already. And so the question has been frequent and so we wanted to post the answer that we've come up with.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the purpose of the new FDA calculator for estimating test performance, and how can it be used effectively?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA calculator is a tool for estimating test performance by inputting sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence for single or two-test strategies. Although not validated, it provides useful performance predictions.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the purpose of the new FDA calculator for estimating test performance, and how can it be used effectively?
VERBATIM ANSWER: On the EUA authorized serological test performance website in the FDA we now list a calculator that you may use. This calculator allows you to input test performance, either a single test prevalence for your population and if you're going to use a two-test strategy, you can put in the performance, the sensitivity specificity - calculated sensitivity specificity for the assay, along with the prevalence and it will give you the combined performance as predicted. This is not actually because we have not validated the actual performance with two tests but it is a potentially useful tool to try to get an estimated performance of either a single test or two independent tests.

Such tests generally require a CLIA waiver certificate, unless specifically authorized for home use; location decisions are guided by CMS requirements.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the FDA's process for determining whether a point-of-care test can be used outside of moderate- or high-complexity labs?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So when we review a potential point of care and near-patient test, we evaluate whether or not that test can be performed outside of a moderately or high- complexity lab and we so designate under this emergency in a way that allows for flexibility in where the tests can be performed. It is not, unless there's specific authorization for home use, it's not authorized for home use. That needs to be made clear. However, we do not as the FDA say exactly where a test should be performed. Rather there are other agency requirements that - and I would refer you to CMS and their recent information about this - but it's my understanding, and confirm with CMS, that if you're outside of a moderately or high-complexity lab, you do require a CLIA certificate to perform that, a CLIA-waiver certificate to perform that testing or the equivalent.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: The umbrella pathway is a streamlined process designed to support developers using serum and plasma tests. It allows NCI testing for EUA authorization but is limited in scope and does not cover near-patient, lay-user, or home testing.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the relationship of the umbrella pathway to the guidance issued on May 4?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Now you also asked about what the difference is between the umbrella and this new guidance on Monday this week. So the umbrella was designed for companies that wanted to basically utilize the NCI testing for supporting their EUA authorization. Now since - at NCI we're at the moment limiting testing to serum and plasma, the sample types that are allowed under that umbrella are limited to serum and plasma, and there are many developers who wish to have more than that and so they may wan whole blood, they may want finger stick. The other thing we couldn't assess under that regulatory pathway, the umbrella pathway was saying near-patient testing, lay-user testing and certainly not home testing or home collection. So the umbrella is really kind of a streamlined pathway for those developers that have a serum and plasma tests and the testing - and the testing of the device could be essentially composing at NCI without any additional testing for those narrow uses.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the pre-EUA pathway still exist?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. A pre-EUA is basically an opportunity to come in and ask questions. It might be, you know, is this an adequate way to validate a test or, you know, for a CLIA-waived test, something like that. Now that we have - the pre-EUA pathway though was a little bit more important when the templates weren't yet finalized and made available. Now that they're finalized and made available, we hope that there's enough information there for all the common variety uses. There will still be some special cases. We - for example, saliva could actually be a sample type for not just molecular but serological tests and even direct antigen tests.

#### 6. High-Quality Sample Characterization for Umbrella Pathway Developers

QA Block 6-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: If a developer is considering the umbrella pathway, could FDA Townhall provide characterization data for the NIH stamp holder being used to help developers understand the level of characterization of the samples?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Developers can contact the FDA's templates email for specific answers. The inter-agency group ensures high-quality, well-characterized samples, confirmed via multiple reference methods for IgM/IgG testing and historical pathogen exposure data. This may make the pathway easier for developers.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If a developer is considering the umbrella pathway, could FDA Townhall provide characterization data for the NIH stamp holder being used to help developers understand the level of characterization of the samples?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah. You can address that question to get specific answers at our templates email address. But the inter-agency group is really focused on pulling together high quality samples for which we have well documented understanding of those samples. With the positive samples, we typically use two separate reference methods to establish the presence or absence of IgM or IgG. And then the negative samples are typically pre-COVID-19 and to the extent that we can utilize specific, known histories of exposure to other pathogens that we incorporate that as needed. Also as we move from say one bench of samples to another, we are trying to harmonize those efforts, but since we so carefully characterized these samples, and they are known to be either IgM or IgG positive, and it requires multiple tests in most cases to verify that a sample is negative or positive, that this really represents a situation that maybe a little bit easier for some developers because these samples are so well characterized. So we don't that this puts any developers at a disadvantage, we're open to hearing if anybody thinks that would.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: Until an EUA is issued, serology lateral flow tests can only be used in highly complex laboratories.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the authorized settings for use of serology lateral flow tests that do not have an EUA?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Under Section D in your new guidance, it indicates that unless and until an EUA is issued, the authorized additional testing environments is limited to highly complex laboratories. So that means that they could only be used in highly complex laboratories until the EUA has been issued and then further designated.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Why isn't it more clear in FDA guidance that only highly complex laboratories can run certain tests without an EUA?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA clarified that it has attempted to be clear in its guidance and FAQs about test complexity categorizations and limitations of the notification pathway. Tests not authorized through EUA are restricted to highly complex laboratories, and tests designed for moderately complex or waived environments cannot be classified as such until reviewed and authorized.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Why isn't it more clear in FDA guidance that only highly complex laboratories can run certain tests without an EUA?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So we've attempted to be clear in our FAQ page as it regards to the list of notified users and if they have not yet notified developers, rather in Section D. And we attempted to make this very clear in terms of what hasn't been authorized, the complexity categorization, and eventually hopefully point of care waived testing. We do show the designation, even for those tests that have not been authorized so in order to classify a test as moderately complex or waived in current in what you see, it is required that we actually make an authorization decision before we can do something to be suitable for moderately complex or waived. And so that's unfortunately the limitation of the notification pathway, that even though a test may be designed for a moderately complex lab, and/or a waived environment, we cannot deem it as such until we have reviewed it and made an authorization decision.

#### 9. FDA Approaches to COVID-19 Testing Flexibility

QA Block 9-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is FDA considering deferring to states on the issue of access to COVID-19 testing instead of maintaining the RX-only requirement?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA currently requires physicians or clinicians with prescribing capabilities to be involved in testing but is open to exploring alternative models and will further investigate this issue.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is FDA considering deferring to states on the issue of access to COVID-19 testing instead of maintaining the RX-only requirement?
VERBATIM ANSWER: To answer I want to make sure that I have it. So today we have operated under the expectation that physicians or clinicians with prescribing capability would be involved in the testing to ensure that the results are accurately relayed back to the patient and the healthcare team that is making decisions. We are open to other models and if you have a way of wanting to do that come and chat with us. I have made a note about what we can do potentially proactively with this. I know that - and I don't want to speak out of turn - that this question has come up, I just don't know if some federal entity has made any pronouncements about that, it wouldn't have come from the office that I direct. And I'm not sure where it would come from. It may be - I'm not even going to speculate, but I will take that back and hopefully provide a way to make that more clear.

QA Block 9-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is FDA expecting to see differences among different types of asymptomatic patients in terms of test performance?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA is open to claims for asymptomatic testing but requires data on test performance in such populations. Current testing discretion lies with healthcare providers, and further data is needed to support performance claims for asymptomatic carriers specifically.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is FDA expecting to see differences among different types of asymptomatic patients in terms of test performance?
VERBATIM ANSWER: It really has to do with, from an FDA perspective, about whether or not evidence is provided that would allow use, or claim use, in asymptomatic populations. I would say I've seen various reports that maybe 20% of SARS coronavirus 2 patients are asymptomatic or maybe presymptomatic and then, of course, there's maybe time periods after symptoms has resolved if they've had SARS coronavirus 2 at which point, for some period of time, they may still be shedding virus. Whether that virus has the ability to infect others or not, may not be known at the present time. So we have typically said that these diagnostic tests, which are not serology tests but rather molecular tests and potentially feature rapid antigen tests that these are intended for populations that are suspected of having COVID-19. Primarily because we have a better understanding of those populations. As our knowledge grows about asymptomatic patients, and what methods may be able to be used to detect whether somebody is an asymptomatic carrier or shatter, and what sample type is best, what swab type might be best, maybe there are multiple sites, maybe there are multiple swab types that would be useful. But for the time being and how evidence is presented in some way to the FDA, we are very open to claims around asymptomatic testing. But for now, our statement is on our website now that testing of asymptomatic individuals who are suspected of COVID-19 is at the discretion of the health care provider. And so that can be somebody, you know, it's up to the healthcare prescriber and so we have offered from at least in FDA perspective, maximal flexibility for use of that. And again, we are very willing to authorize a test for use in asymptomatic individuals. We just, we would like to see the data that supports that, you know, what the performance in such a population would be. For example, what percentage of asymptomatic carriers would be - would test positive. Is there any risk of false positives? So those are not necessarily easy studies to carry out. And designing them to assess whether or not somebody is an asymptomatic carrier, you know, would require some discussion with our FDA Townhall team.

#### 13. Challenges and Alternatives in Expanding COVID-19 Testing Capacity

QA Block 13-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How can molecular testing not be used for the general population when it is used for contact tracing?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Molecular testing for broader population use is limited by lab capacity to swiftly process results despite manufacturers' efforts. FDA and CMS have provided flexibility to expand testing capacity and are developing rapid antigen tests to ease constraints, despite challenges in sensitivity.
VERBATIM QUESTION: how can molecular testing not be used for the general population when it is used for contact tracing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. No, that's a great question and it's a challenging situation. And although we the manufacturers have really done a great job on the molecular test, at least make the PCR readings in high abundance, a lot of high throughput manufacturers have come on to the market with UA authorizations. But even so, the need for testing and the desire for the molecular testing has a tendency to potentially outstrip the lab capacity to, you know, return molecular results in a timely matter for if you really want to expand testing into more populations. So that is definitely a challenge. It's definitely one that we've been thinking about and others in the government have been thinking about how to handle. Unfortunately, CMS has provided some flexibility here. The FDA has provided some flexibility as well in that we've on our FAQ page for alternative ways to do molecular testing, we are allowing an expanding number of essay PCR instruments to be used, properly validated some sort of bridging city by the lab. And CMS has - to my understanding - given the ability to expand a CLIA lab to be able to use other instruments that may be on campus. So I will just refer you to the CMS memo. That said, we know that expanded testing is FDA Townhall really a requirement. And we are very encouraged that there are a number of developers that are developing a rapid antigen test. Now, traditionally have not been as sensitive as molecular tests, that's a known challenge. We have been reaching and discussing tests with stakeholder communities and professional organizations. And although we know that the performance may be less sensitive, say, then a molecular test, there may still be value if users understand the performance of these tests and the proper use of these tests and the proper interpretation and use of results. So for example, some of these rapid tests may be very specific so if you get a positive result in a short amount of time, you can probably act on it. If you get a negative result, you will want to understand what is the sensitivity of the test, what is the potential for a false negative, and use other information that's available to healthcare workers to assess what is the proper follow-up for the patient. Perhaps it's a reflex to a molecular test in the appropriate situations. The advantage of the rapid antigen tests is that they can be produced in quantities of millions. And can it be point of care and so and obviously high yield a rapid result. So as with everything else in this emergency, we try to walk a fine line of balancing risks and benefits and understanding the performance of various technologies, trying to address concerns with the certain issues and but the overall objective is trying to make high-quality, accurate testing available in the largest possible way.

VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. So there's different flavors. So some test, let's say we are going to look at IgG and were going to look at IgM, there is other claims such as PAN anti-body. We expect a test that has been developed for PAN anti-body will be able to detect all of the isotypes. And then there are others that may only partially cover some of the isotypes, so they cannot claim PAN antibody tests.
