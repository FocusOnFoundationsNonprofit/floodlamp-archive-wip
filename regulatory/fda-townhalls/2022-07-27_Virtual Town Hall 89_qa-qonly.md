#### 4. Challenges and Recommendations for Saliva-Based Antigen Home Tests

QA Block 4-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the FDA have any recommendations or advice for saliva-based antigen home tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA has observed challenges with saliva-based antigen tests but notes advantages if successful. They recommend following antigen test validation and using a high-sensitivity nasopharyngeal swab comparator. For symptomatic cases, use 30 positives and 30 negatives. Consider having an anterior nares swab as a backup.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Thanks for taking my question. This is Anjali from Color Health, and I was curious if the FDA has any recommendations or advice for saliva-based antigen home tests.
VERBATIM ANSWER: So we've seen quite a bit of attempts at saliva-based antigen tests. I don't know exactly why it's been such a challenge. You know, there are a lot of advantages if it would work, but it may be that there's a concentration that's needed, such as with a molecular test. So some of the molecular tests have not worked quite well in saliva, but that may be due to the concentration effect in extraction. So if you want to attempt it, you would just follow the recommendations, if you want, for antigen test validation. The comparator for saliva would be a nasopharyngeal swab using a high sensitivity molecular central lab test. I would double check with the FDA before using a comparator test to make sure that it's high sensitivity enough. And then thirty positives and thirty negatives if you're going for symptomatic individuals. We have recommended to others that want to pursue saliva. If this is a new test, we would recommend that you also consider as a backup and anterior nares swab. So that if you should have any issues with saliva, at least you have anterior nares.

VERBATIM ANSWER: So the EUAs we're talking about today are for COVID. And on November 15, 2021, we established our priorities for review, and that guidance applies only to COVID. And so those are the tests we're talking about today. We're not talking about any other disease. So the EUA statute doesn't apply to monkeypox, and so this pathway doesn't exist for monkeypox right now. Nor does it apply for any other disease state that doesn't have an emergency declared.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA conducts safety reviews for all tests, including at-home tests with additional considerations for home settings. Toxicology reviews evaluate the potential presence of toxins and mitigation measures; this is addressed in routine home test reviews.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is the FDA requiring a full extractables and leachables assessment for non-patient-contacting, tightly sealed containers in molecular at-home tests, or are rationales acceptable?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So we do a safety review for all tests, including home tests. There are additional safety considerations for a home test, because of the location of the testing and the fact that consumers are using the test rather than medical professionals. And so in submission, we want to know what's in your test. And we'll do a toxicology review when we see that. And, you know, if there were toxins in there, but there are mitigations that prevent access by a consumer, we would assess the mitigations for that situation.

#### 10. EUA vs. Full Authorization: Process Timing and Recommendations

QA Block 10-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the benefit of continuing the EUA process to get a quicker response compared to a Q-Sub?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA acknowledges that review times for Q-Sub/Pre-Submissions are extended due to high workloads on COVID and monkeypox. The EUA process currently remains quicker and easier to navigate for market entry, though full authorization requires more samples.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the benefit of continuing the EUA process to get a quicker response compared to a Q-Sub?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Well, we continue to get, on average, 100 new IVD EUAs and other related submissions a month, though our team continues to be swamped, and our Q-Sub/Pre-Sub review times are still extended due to the overwhelming amount of COVID work and now our work with monkeypox. We have personnel now dedicated to monkeypox review. So that has eroded some of our capability as we respond to this outbreak. So I can't give you review times. We are recommending that people go for authorization. We have a lot of recommendations in the templates, so I would restrict pre-EUAs for an EUA, a pre-EUA. We have an EUA tip to very narrow questions rather than broad questions that have been answered through our templates and our template recommendations. And especially as things have updated, the transcripts that we've had in the last weeks and months on COVID. So unfortunately, I can't tell you the best route. There's going to be more samples required for a full authorization. The EUA process, at the moment, at least, still is easier to get through to get onto the market.

#### 13. Guidance and Updates on Breath-Based Diagnostics

QA Block 13-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Have there been any changes to the guidance document on breath-based tests for EUA since a breath-based diagnostic has been authorized?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The current guidance, including the documentation on the authorized breath-based diagnostic test, reflects the FDA's present thinking. Developers should reengage with the FDA to ensure recommendations remain current, especially for different technologies.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Have there been any changes to the guidance document on breath-based tests for EUA since a breath-based diagnostic has been authorized?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So it's always good if you're going to develop a test to take a look at if we have templates posted, or take a look at the transcripts from this call to see if there's any updates. As far as breath tests go, that was an evolving science to understand its ability to detect COVID. And looking at the documents on that authorized test on the FDA website, looking at the instructions for use and the conditions of authorization, letter of authorization with the conditions of authorization, are pretty up to date as far as our current thinking for any sort of similar test. But just like any test, there are variations on how you would approach, in this case, breath tests. So if the technology is different, we may have different questions. So it's best if you want to engage in developing or validating such a test that you reengage with the FDA and make sure that our recommendations are still current.

#### 14. CLIA Waived and Central Lab Workflow Validation Guidance

QA Block 14-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is it possible to target two different groups in the same COVID EUA application, such as one workflow for CLIA waived status and another for high and moderate complexity labs?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: It is possible to have two workflows in the same COVID EUA application, one for CLIA waived and another for high/moderate complexity labs, but it depends on workflow modifications and their impact on performance validation. Validation may need to be performed separately for each workflow.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Hi. Nikita Robinson from BioGX. I was wondering, when we process our COVID EUA, if it's possible to target two different groups, such as one workflow for a CLIA waived status, as well as a workflow that is for high and moderate complexity labs.
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah, that's a question that's probably best specifically answered through the pre-EUA process. I would say-- and Kris can correct me here-- but we want to be careful not to-- you said CLIA waived. OK, these are medical locations by and large. And I don't think there is a problem to have two different instructions in there. We would want to assess with the FDA if those different workflows could impact performance and whether or not you need to validate each sort of independently. So it would depend on what modifications are made between one workflow and the other and what its impact on performance would be. But having a central lab instructions separate from the CLIA waived instructions, that's a possibility. I mean, the CLIA waived instructions are usually super simple. They're almost like OTC instructions. So I think we just have to explore a way. The worst-case scenario is you would just have two different kits. We would split your application into two different kits. You would have one labeled for CLIA and one labeled for central lab. Kris, do you have any other guidance?

CLARIFIED QUESTION: When splitting an EUA application into separate kits for CLIA waived and central lab workflows, are there additional regulatory considerations developers should be aware of?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA indicates developers need to assess whether separate workflows impact performance and validate independently based on modifications. Separate instructions for CLIA waived and central lab workflows are possible with potential for separate kits, and validation of the CLIA waived workflow must occur in POC settings.

For the POC part, or what you're calling CLIA waived, but it actually POC, we are going to want to see validation in the hands of those POC users. And then of course, if we get that POC EUA, that can be used at a high complexity laboratory as well. So there is an impact there on the validation. Yeah. Yeah, good point. Yeah, yeah, you can't validate the CLIA waived version in a central lab.

#### 15. Transitioning EUAs to 510(k) Compliance Requirements for Assays

QA Block 15-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: For an assay that is initially authorized under an EUA and later converted to a 510k, do all components used in the trial, such as primers and probes, need to comply with GMP requirements?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: While not all GMP requirements are necessary for EUA, full 510k authorization will require compliance. RUO primers and probes can be used if integrated into a quality system with proper QC. Consistency in assay performance between EUA and full authorization is crucial.
VERBATIM QUESTION: For an assay that is initially authorized under an EUA and later converted to a 510k, do all components used in the trial, such as primers and probes, need to comply with GMP requirements?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So you're correct. For many tests, not necessarily all, we waive many of the 820 requirements. But when it comes in for full authorization, that is something that we'll want to see eventually. For those entities that don't have full 820 compliance now, that's certainly something that is very appropriate to discuss in the Q-Sub or Pre-Sub submission. But manufacturers can use RUO primers and probes if they bring it into their quality system and they have incoming QC, and they manage those components according to their quality system. So by and large, the most important thing is that you're not making any material changes to your assay that would impact performance between your EUA and your full product. In that case, we're anticipating to be able to utilize all of the EUA data as long as it's on actual clinical samples for a full authorization.
