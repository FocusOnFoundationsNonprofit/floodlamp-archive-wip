QA Block 1-6
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Why might manufacturers still choose to provide Unique Device Identifiers (UDIs) for EUA devices, even though it is not required?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Manufacturers may still provide Unique Device Identifiers (UDIs) for EUA devices, as the device identifier is required for fulfilling laboratory reporting requirements under HHS COVID-19 reporting guidance.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Why might manufacturers still choose to provide Unique Device Identifiers (UDIs) for EUA devices, even though it is not required?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Generally, for - at least for the diagnostics, UDI has not been included as a condition of authorization. So, we would not typically expect a UDI unless it is included as a condition of authorization in the letter - the EUA letters. However, there's no restriction from providing UDIs, which many manufacturers do, and this is really helpful because the device identifier is a required data element to fulfill the laboratory reporting requirements listed in the HHS COVID-19 laboratory data reporting guidance.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: UDI for EUA devices, laboratory reporting requirements, HHS guidance
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-7
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What role does the Unique Device Identifier play in fulfilling laboratory reporting requirements under HHS guidance?

VERBATIM QUESTION: What role does the Unique Device Identifier play in fulfilling laboratory reporting requirements under HHS guidance?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We had a question last week about UDI, Unique Device Identifiers, and whether UDI is required for EUA devices. And generally, for - at least for the diagnostics, UDI has not been included as a condition of authorization. So, we would not typically expect a UDI unless it is included as a condition of authorization in the letter - the EUA letters. However, there's no restriction from providing UDIs, which many manufacturers do, and this is really helpful because the device identifier is a required data element to fulfill the laboratory reporting requirements listed in the HHS COVID-19 laboratory data reporting guidance.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)

#### 8. Validating Tests for Emerging COVID-19 Variants

QA Block 8-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the recommended process to validate tests that detect new COVID-19 variants?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA suggests whole-genome sequencing as a valuable approach for variant testing due to the widespread and evolving mutations. Developers can submit applications for tests that target any subset of variants to be reviewed, but are advised to design assays anticipating future variant emergence.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the recommended process to validate tests that detect new COVID-19 variants?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Right. So, our current thinking on this - because there are so many mutations, and the number of variants that is - that are present and of concern is growing and there's many different mentions of that. Whole-genome sequencing may be a good modality to do genotyping because mutations can occur, you know, anywhere in the virus, and then we want to know about that. However, we are accepting applications for any subset of variants that a developer wants to review. I would hope that any work you do around variant testing wouldn't be of value for just a short amount of time. So, it's something to consider as you develop an assay because, you know, as soon as you might have a, you know, FDA Townhall a test that can identify the Brazilian, the UK and the South African variants and their various branches, you know, there may be some - a new variant that's, you know, of importance that's not on your test.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA does not require a specific telehealth provider for home testing EUAs. It is up to the developer to determine the method, and the protocol will be reviewed for adequacy.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can FDA confirm that the EUA can be authorized without a specific telehealth provider identified in the EUA?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We don't require that you use a telehealth provider. That's up to the test developer for home testing. So, if you choose to do so, you know, we would evaluate what they would do.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the considerations for choosing between a prescription pathway and an over-the-counter pathway for home testing?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA encourages developers to pursue over-the-counter testing to increase accessibility, as it doesn't require a prescription. Cost considerations, such as avoiding telehealth expenses, may also influence the choice of pathway. Ultimately, the decision lies with the test developer.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the considerations for choosing between a prescription pathway and an over-the-counter pathway for home testing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: And of course, there's a prescription pathway and an over-the-counter pathway for home testing.

QA Block 10-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are some of the requirements to support a claim for detecting antibodies post-vaccination?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA suggests beginning with an intended use statement, as it will guide validation study designs. Different vaccines may require different data, and studies should specify data for each vaccine. Consider testing before and after vaccination to establish baseline and post-vaccination antibody presence, including timelines for positivity. These requirements can support a pre-EUA application.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are some of the requirements to support a claim for detecting antibodies post-vaccination?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. So, it's always good to start with, you know, your intended use statement, as you would like to propose to the FDA. And how you write that and how you propose that will determine the validation study designs that would be appropriate to support those claims. So, if you're saying you can detect antibodies after a vaccination, you would want probably - you know, different antibodies may be accumulated by different vaccines. So, there may be, you know, data that we need to look at regarding each specific vaccine that you're going to make a claim for. Think of this as kind of a companion diagnostic test, right? And companion tests are specific for - we evaluate them specifically for each drug, even it's a drug for the same - a different drug for the same target. You know, and what data - and in your study design and proposal, you know - what data would be, you know, important in your minds to show - to support the claim that you seek. FDA Townhall You know, if you're going to say, you know, after a vaccine - just a thought; I'm not saying these are recommendations - but if you're looking at the impact of the vaccine, you'd probably want to have a test prior to vaccination to show that your test was negative. And then, after the vaccination, you know, how many days before it becomes positive. So, we'll want to definitely see, you know, how long it takes for how many people to be positive after a vaccine. So, those are just some high-level thoughts that you should consider in putting together your study design and submitting it as a pre-EUA.
