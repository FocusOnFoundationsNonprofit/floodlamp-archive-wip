#### 1. FDA Updates on SARS-CoV-2 Test Validation Efforts

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What criteria does the FDA currently prioritize when evaluating COVID-19 diagnostic tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA prioritizes COVID-19 diagnostic tests that meet momentary needs by increasing testing volume and access, especially for high-volume tests designed for home use, point of care, or central labs.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What criteria does the FDA currently prioritize when evaluating COVID-19 diagnostic tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We continue to see this pandemic evolve and stay with us, unfortunately, in a very significant way, and so we stay very close to the situation so that we can always provide the priority for those tests that are going to best meet the needs at the moment, and this has evolved over time. Our priorities are listed on our website. You can go there, and you can you can review them. They're all designed to increase the volume of tests significantly and the access to test significantly, and that is primarily focused at diagnostic tests, in the home, point of care, and in the central labs. And we are most focused on those tests that are high volume tests in certainly safer point of care or home, no single point of care side or home site is going to do a significant volume. But in distributing that test in as many homes as possible and as many point of care sites possible in supporting those sites with significant production of the tests, you provide that possibility and that's what we are focusing our reviews on at this time.

#### 6. EUA Process for Rebranded Identical Molecular Tests

QA Block 6-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How much of the original data needs to be included in the new EUA submission for a rebranded test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: If the test is identical except for branding and you have a right of reference, data from the original EUA can be leveraged. Alternatively, the original sponsor can update the EUA to list the new company as a distributor with alternate labeling, avoiding the need for a new EUA.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How much of the original data needs to be included in the new EUA submission for a rebranded test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So generally if you have a right of reference from the original sponsor you can leverage data from their submission. However, if the test truly is identical other than the brand name, a simpler pathway would be to have the original sponsor send in an update to their EUA naming this additional company as a distributor and they can submit the alternate labeling with the new brand under the original EUA. And then, as Tim mentioned earlier, we do include additional brand names on our website so that would be added to that original EUA rather than needing a new EUA there.

#### 9. Implications of Modifying EUA-Authorized Laboratory Test Systems

QA Block 9-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: If a laboratory makes a modification to a test system that does have an EUA, should they follow guidelines for actual patient results reporting such as detected versus non-detected?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Modifications to an EUA-authorized test generally make it unauthorized, requiring validation of the modifications, including result interpretation and reporting adjustments. Guidance is available in FDA policy documents and FAQs.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If a laboratory makes a modification to a test system that does have an EUA, should they follow guidelines for actual patient results reporting such as detected versus non-detected?

CLARIFIED ANSWER: Changes to the LOD or CT cutoffs may affect result interpretation and reporting. Any modified test must be validated, including cutoffs and reporting.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If modifications impact the limit of detection (LOD) or CT cutoffs, does it affect result interpretation and reporting?
VERBATIM ANSWER: But you know I mean if it changes the LOD, if it changes the CT cut offs, then it may impact the result interpretation and reporting. If it does not change those things, it may not. So I think the you know sort of the key is that making a modification generally would make the test, no longer you know the authorized test, and we would expect the new version, the modified version of the test to be validated, including the cut offs and the reporting.

#### 11. Validation Requirements for Asymptomatic PCR Screening Tests

QA Block 11-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How many samples need to be tested to validate a test for asymptomatic screening or surveillance testing?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: For asymptomatic screening validation, a minimum of 10 asymptomatic samples and 10 symptomatic samples with matched viral loads are required premarket. Post-market testing of an additional 10 asymptomatic samples is also necessary. Alternatively, serial testing allows premarket validation on symptomatic patients using specific criteria.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How many samples need to be tested to validate a test for asymptomatic screening or surveillance testing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Okay, so moderate and high complexity. Yes, um so you know I will answer your question directly as well, but be aware of the serial testing option. So if it's a molecular test, the high sensitivity central molecular test. The serial testing pathway allows you to validate on basically symptomatic patient that allows you to collect data more quickly, get your authorization, as long as it meets our performance expectation. And those would generally be for central and molecular test, you'd be at 95% PPA or greater. Then, then you can simply agree to do serial testing in your IFU package insert and have the test performed at least once a week. and get that asymptomatic screening claim, without having to test premarket asymptomatic patients. Now you can also pursue EUA authorization, as others have successfully done testing you know, in the symptomatic population for screening and, Toby you're going to correct me here, please, but I think it's pre authorization, we require a minimum of 10 asymptomatic patients and then an additional 10 premarket that can be from symptomatic patients but that are matched in the viral loads as seen in your asymptomatic sample. So we will look at 20 results in the pre-authorization phase only 10 of which have to be from asymptomatic patients. Then post market if you only you have the minimum number of 10 asymptomatic premarket, we will go ahead and authorize you with a screening claim and then post market, you would agree to complete testing for additional 10 positive asymptomatic patients, so that we can have a greater assurance that it's performing well in the symptomatic screening population. The same pathway is available for essentially all the other direct test types as well. Hopefully, that answer your question.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: When conducting post-market testing for 10 additional positive asymptomatic cases, do we also need to perform testing on 10 symptomatic cases with matched viral loads like premarket?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: No, testing on 10 symptomatic cases with matched viral loads post-market is not required. The FDA uses viral load comparisons primarily to understand results premarket.
VERBATIM QUESTION: When conducting post-market testing for 10 additional positive asymptomatic cases, do we also need to perform testing on 10 symptomatic cases with matched viral loads like premarket?
VERBATIM ANSWER: No, that's just for us to understand. You know, we have seen differences in viral loads and typically, well, I don't know of any case where viral loads were higher in the symptomatic population at least to date studies that have reviewed and our team has reviewed so. So that is just to get enough information as a viral load in your studies that are asymptomatic patients and comparable to asymptomatic patients, so we can make up our best decision premarket with only see 10 asymptomatic positive results.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Regarding matched viral loads, should we compare similar CP values or perform separate testing to measure viral loads and RNA concentration?
VERBATIM ANSWER: No that's not needed. Just use an EUA authorized appropriate high sensitivity molecular comparative result that reports out CTs. In different molecular tests that report CTs - the CTs don't mean the same thing - so ideally you use just one EUA authorized by sensitivity molecular asset that report CTs for your study and then we look at those relatives CT numbers.

#### 12. Antigen Test Validation and Low Positive Sample Expectations

QA Block 12-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the viral distribution expectations for prospective collection of the full 30 positives for an antigen test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA expects a normal viral distribution for 30 positive samples collected prospectively. If using bank samples, developers must engage with FDA and perform relevant validation studies. Fresh positive samples pose challenges but are necessary to demonstrate performance expectations.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the viral distribution expectations for prospective collection of the full 30 positives for an antigen test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We want to see a normal distribution prospectively as well as if you're allowed after conversation with us to submit bank samples or for some situation for bank samples, you said antigen test, though. Yes, it's not all situations, or is it appropriate for bank samples to be used, but typically point of care we have allowed bank samples, the first antigen test authorization was actually mostly on bank sample but that developer ended up moving away from VTM samples, because there were issues with VTM so if you're going to use VTM samples rather than bank, direct swabs, that those are issues to work out with the FDA. We want to see freeze thaw studies, because for many tests, we've seen an increase in sensitivity, through a freeze thaw cycle. And, and we want to understand how that could impact the performance measurement and therefore what goes in your package insert for performance, because you know if your LOD is better on frozen samples, and your clinical validation is better on frozen samples, we want to know that. And we want to know, then basically with fresh samples that your performance is meeting expectation. So it's a bit complex and at first authorization, even though we allowed a bank VTM sample we wanted to see a complete set of VTM samples 30 positives and 30 negatives, and then we also because they didn't want instructions in their tests to you got to freeze the samples before you use it. I mean we're open to developers who want to put that into their instructions for use and that's what the authorization they speak, but that would be you know a bit of an impediment for most point of care to another. For the lab after we see the sample fresh and then freeze it before using it, so we wanted to see you know some fresh sample data now fresh negative should be no problem at all. And it's the fresh positives that have, at times, been a challenge, right now, unfortunately, you know if you're having you know, a challenge getting fresh positives, you're probably not you know you haven't picked the right clinical trial sites and unfortunately right now, there are so many opportunities in the country with high positivity rate that that should not be a problem. But if you want to speed access to your test, you can use bank samples just you know, make sure that you engage with the FDA review staff, make sure all the appropriate studies are done and, if you have at least 30 positive I mean 30 negative fresh samples and five positive fresh samples with showing good performance you can't like show PPA of zero percent on those five samples and expect to have to authorize the first sample.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA currently prefers to see low positives distributed in 20 to 25% within three cycle thresholds of the LOD of the comparator molecular assay. This requirement is being aligned with molecular standards and may evolve based on challenges experienced by developers.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Do the requirements for 10 to 20% low positive distribution apply to fully prospective antigen test evaluations or only to retrospective or enrichment evaluations?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Our current thinking is low positives really have to do with the molecular competitor and we're looking at aligning our recommendation for low positive with that, and so our current thinking, is we really like to see those low positives 20 to 25%. within three CTs of the LOD of the comparator molecular assay, so that that's going to have to be an assay that reports out CTs obviously And LOD is different than the cut off.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Under what conditions is it appropriate to use bank samples for an antigen test as opposed to direct swabs?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Bank samples may be used for antigen tests if approved by the FDA after discussions, typically in point-of-care settings. The appropriateness depends on factors like freeze-thaw studies to assess sensitivity and performance impacts. Fresh samples are preferred but challenges in collection might allow bank samples with sufficient validation.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Under what conditions is it appropriate to use bank samples for an antigen test as opposed to direct swabs?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We want to see a normal distribution prospectively as well as if you're allowed after conversation with us to submit bank samples or for some situation for bank samples, you said antigen test, though. Yes, it's not all situations, or is it appropriate for bank samples to be used, but typically point of care we have allowed bank samples, the first antigen test authorization was actually mostly on bank sample but that developer ended up moving away from VTM samples, because there were issues with VTM so if you're going to use VTM samples rather than bank, direct swabs, that those are issues to work out with the FDA.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the pooling and screening guidance allow us to proceed with an existing EUA by submitting information and updating labeling, or does the notification also require test data?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah so if and Toby I want you to back me up on this and continue, that if you're just going for three x and you already have EUA authorization ,we're not going to need to see that data and expect you to authorize that. There's good reason for that, based on historical data from many pooling test submissions. And the ability of a test that's already high sensitivity to perform well in a three x pool basically you know if you're following specific recommendations and path that we provided there, we've never seen a good test fail at three x. Toby? I think there may be some caveats and I may have missed some details in the question of notification, all that is probably a good question to turn over to you. Yeah I can definitely address that, so this is referring I believe you're referring to the EUA amendment that we issued on April 20 to amend certain EUAs to add pooled screening as part of a serial testing program, and so the letter of authorization for that amendment does include specific criteria for the tests that would fall under that amendment, as well as specific information that needs to be submitted to FDA as part of that notification to be added to the exhibit of the amendment.

The FDA requires data to ensure app readers perform as well or better than manual reading, including usability and clinical studies for home users.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Do developers need to perform another clinical validation for tests transitioning from manually read to app-read?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We do have some items in our antigen templates for this. And we do have a mobile app software group that reviews this and can answer questions for either EUAs or pre-EUAs, but this is pretty straightforward work at this point. We've we've authorized some of these already and the question is, you know, do they you need to do another clinical validation or analytical validation and the short answer on both of those is yes, we have seen widely different results from these kind of devices between manually read and visually read and we've seen some Apps that perform really well and others that we've not been able to authorize and so. it's important for mobile phone app readers to be developed in a way that perform as accurately or better than manually read results. Also there is this is home and there's a user interface here and it's important that the FDA have data that home users can can accurately use these reader devices in the home and get the right result so that obviously entails new usability and new clinical study in that situation. So that they can get accurate results, that they can still read the manual results, that they know how to handle you know certain conflicts between the app reading and the manual reading. So those are important considerations also, we know that analytically things like the LOD, cross reactivity, false results can,false positives and false negatives, can happen when you move to a device app to read the test. So yes, the analytical studies will be recommended to be performed, as well as the clinical studies to evaluate this new technology for the test.

Modifications require validation, including cut-offs and patient result reporting. Specific recommendations are available in FDA guidance and FAQs.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If the laboratory modifies a test system from a manufacturer that does have an EUA, should they still follow the manufacturer's patient result reporting guidelines?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Right, so I think some of that will depend on what it is that you're modifying and how it impacts the performance of the test. You know, we do have recommendations in the COVID test guidance, the policy guidance and some additional information on the FAQs about our recommendations for validating such modifications and what to do in those situations. But you know I mean if it changes the LOD, if it changes the CT cut offs, then it may impact the result interpretation and reporting. If it does not change those things, it may not. So I think the you know sort of the key is that making a modification generally would make the test, no longer you know the authorized test, and we would expect the new version, the modified version of the test to be validated, including the cut offs and the reporting.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is expected when a laboratory modifies an EUA-authorized test and needs to validate the new version, including cutoffs and reporting?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: When a lab modifies an EUA-authorized test, the modification often renders it no longer authorized, and validation of the new version is required. Changes to LOD, CT cutoffs, or similar performance aspects must be fully validated, and appropriate reporting should reflect any new performance characteristics.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Should EUA authorization holders advise laboratories on modifying tests and validating changes, or should they seek FDA amendments for such modifications?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: EUA authorization holders should not advise labs on modifying tests or validating changes. Instead, they must validate modifications themselves, submit them to the FDA, and seek an amendment or supplemental authorization for approval.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Should EUA authorization holders advise laboratories on modifying tests and validating changes, or should they seek FDA amendments for such modifications?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, the labs if they make modification and then fail to them to fully validate those changes and if there's any changes in performance that should be reflected in the reporting. And the other thing to add is that EUA authorization holders should not be advising labs on modifying their test and validating the changes. If an EUA authorization holder wishes for there to be a modification to their tests then they should validate it and submit it to the FDA and seek an amendment or supplement authorization from the FDA so that they can then legitimately promote that modification.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Can a laboratory collaborate with the test manufacturer to validate modifications and encourage submission of a supplemental EUA request for broader use?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Just a little bit to build on what you were just saying Tim, you know if a lab is interested in modifying a manufacturer's test. You know, particularly if it's to add a component that is more readily available to them. It is also very beneficial if the if the lab can reach out to the manufacturer, and if it's a modification that could potentially benefit more broadly than just the single lab, then you have the ability to collaborate with the manufacturer, give them the ability to use your validation data, and encourage them to submit it as a supplemental EUA request to update their authorization.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does a modification to an EUA-authorized test automatically mean it can no longer be claimed as an authorized test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: A modification to an EUA-authorized test generally makes it no longer an authorized test, and validation of the modified test, including cutoffs and reporting, is necessary.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does a modification to an EUA-authorized test automatically mean it can no longer be claimed as an authorized test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: But at a high level, if a laboratory makes a modification to a test and it no longer follows the instructions for use of that test, it could impact the performance and it does take that test out of the realm of an EUA authorized test. The lab can no longer claim that it is such a test. So as Tim was saying, making a modification does make the test basically not an authorized test anymore. So I think the you know sort of the key is that making a modification generally would make the test, no longer you know the authorized test, and we would expect the new version, the modified version of the test to be validated, including the cut offs and the reporting.
