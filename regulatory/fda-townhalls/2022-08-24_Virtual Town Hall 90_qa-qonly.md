#### 2. EUA Requirements for Multiplex COVID-19 and Flu Tests

QA Block 2-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is FDA currently accepting EUA requests for multiplex antigen tests that can detect a combination of viruses, for example, SARS-CoV-2 and influenza, intended for use in an over-the-counter (OTC) setting?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA has not authorized any over-the-counter multi-analyte antigen tests, but they meet current priorities, and FDA recommends submitting a pre-EUA to discuss test design and proposals.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is FDA currently accepting EUA requests for multiplex antigen tests that can detect a combination of viruses, for example, SARS-CoV-2 and influenza, intended for use in an over-the-counter (OTC) setting?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So we have authorized several antigen multi‐analyte diagnostic tests intended for use at laboratory and point of care sites. We currently do not have any multi‐analyte over‐the­ counter tests authorized, but we do have recommendations in the appropriate template, and these types of tests do meet the current priorities. We've noted here before that if you're considering an over­ the‐counter multi‐analyte test, we recommend that you submit a pre‐EUA to further discuss your test design and proposal.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Commander Kimberly Piermatteo (FDA)
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: EUA for OTC multiplex tests, FDA recommendations, multi-analyte antigen tests
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 2-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: For a multiplex molecular test with both flu and COVID, is it required to have a separate call for both flu A and flu B in addition to COVID, or is it acceptable to combine flu A and flu B into a general influenza call?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends reporting separate results for flu A and flu B, as the risks and benefits associated with each differ.
VERBATIM QUESTION: For a multiplex molecular test with both flu and COVID, is it required to have a separate call for both flu A and flu B in addition to COVID, or is it acceptable to combine flu A and flu B into a general influenza call?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Regarding the flu and COVID and the separate calls for flu A and B, there are numerous flu A/B rapid antigen tests on the market, and all of those differentiate between flu A and B. So our current recommendations are in favor of reporting a separate flu A and B result because the risks and benefits of flu A and B results are different.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Commander Kimberly Piermatteo (FDA)
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: Multiplex molecular tests, Flu and COVID differentiation, Flu A and B reporting

#### 8. Conducting Flu B Studies Outside the United States

QA Block 8-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: If conducting a flu B clinical study in South American countries, do samples need to be brought to the United States for testing?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: There is no requirement to perform flu B sample testing in the U.S. for the comparator method, but FDA recommends ensuring the study setting resembles that of a U.S. user. Specific proposals should be submitted as a pre-EUA supplement.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If conducting a flu B clinical study in South American countries, do samples need to be brought to the United States for testing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Certainly, there's no requirement to do the testing in the U.S. for the comparator method. OUS studies are tricky. And especially if you were designing a test for over‐the‐counter use, we want to ensure that that setting is similar to a setting that a typical user in the U.S. would experience. So I think we're open to the proposal, but there are certainly more details than we could cover here. So again, I would recommend sending a supplement to that pre‐EUA. If you've got a proposal and some specific questions, we're glad to address that in a supplement. And just to comment on the time frame a little bit, the more detail and the more focused questions that you provide in a pre‐EUA, the better we can answer your questions and the quicker we can answer your questions. Just asking us for a study design for OUS for flu B, that's going to be a little bit more difficult and take much longer for us to answer. So if you've got really targeted questions, specifically about a study design that you have planned, we're glad to accept that in a pre‐EUA.

Sponsors are encouraged to provide detailed study designs through a pre-EUA supplement for proper review.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the specific challenges the FDA sees with studies conducted outside the U.S. (OUS) for over-the-counter diagnostics?

CLARIFIED QUESTION: How can developers ensure that the study setting outside the U.S. is sufficiently similar to U.S. conditions for an over-the-counter test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends ensuring that the outside-U.S. study setting resembles a typical U.S. user environment for an over-the-counter test. Developers should submit detailed proposals through a pre-EUA supplement.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How can developers ensure that the study setting outside the U.S. is sufficiently similar to U.S. conditions for an over-the-counter test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: OUS studies are tricky. And especially if you were designing a test for over‐the‐counter use, we want to ensure that that setting is similar to a setting that a typical user in the U.S. would experience. So I think we're open to the proposal, but there are certainly more details than we could cover here. So again, I would recommend sending a supplement to that pre‐EUA.

VERBATIM QUESTION: What additional information or level of detail should be provided in a pre-EUA to expedite the review process for OUS study designs?

If you've got a proposal and some specific questions, we're glad to address that in a supplement. And just to comment on the time frame a little bit, the more detail and the more focused questions that you provide in a pre‐EUA, the better we can answer your questions and the quicker we can answer your questions. Just asking us for a study design for OUS for flu B, that's going to be a little bit more difficult and take much longer for us to answer.

#### 9. Optimizing Clinical Trial Design for Dual Testing Kits

QA Block 9-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is it possible to conduct a clinical trial for two antigen testing kits (one for influenza A and B with COVID-19 detection and one for influenza A and B alone) at the same time using one swab and one extraction buffer under IRB approval?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA suggests submitting a pre-EUA and proposing a detailed sampling plan that accounts for using the same buffer and minimizes bias. This would lower risk and ensure FDA buy-in before conducting the trial.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is it possible to conduct a clinical trial for two antigen testing kits (one for influenza A and B with COVID-19 detection and one for influenza A and B alone) at the same time using one swab and one extraction buffer under IRB approval?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah, thanks for that. It's a little bit of a challenge because you are using the test kind of off label or not with the instructions that folks will have if it's either the COVID/flu combo or the flu alone. That being said, we do want to try to make efficiencies available to developers where it's appropriate. And so I think probably you're going to want to submit this as a pre‐EUA and let us know what the volumes are, what the challenges are, what happens if they run out of volume on the second test or something of that nature. And then I would also maybe think about a backup plan as well. So propose a sampling plan of, we'll do the standard care first, then we'll do the flu/COVID next, then the flu alone, and some sort of randomization scheme. So I would just plan for both instances or provide us a plan, I guess, in both instances, one, using the same abstraction buffer and two, provide a sampling plan that minimizes bias for the two candidate tests.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Before conducting these clinical trials at the same time, is it necessary to get pre-EUA review from the FDA to ensure the clinical study minimizes bias?
