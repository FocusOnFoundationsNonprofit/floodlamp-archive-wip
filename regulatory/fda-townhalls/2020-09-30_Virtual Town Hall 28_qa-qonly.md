CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA requires determination of LOD, but it places more importance on overall clinical performance, including sensitivity and specificity, than on LOD results.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the expectation for the LOD for antigen tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Is LOD, you know, probably many outside the FDA have made more deal of LOD than we do. First of all, if there's not an easy way to harmonize how LODs experiments are performed. It's very hard for us to assess individual LOD determinations. We do require it. We expect you to do it but it is a lesser review item than for FDA Virtual Townhall actual clinical study performance. That is, what is your sensitivity, and what is your specificity?
SPEAKER QUESTION: Franco Calderon
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: LOD expectations, Antigen tests, Clinical performance
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 5-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Could you explain more about sensitivity and specificity expectations for antigen tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA expects antigen tests to demonstrate at least 80% sensitivity during the infectious period, correlating approximately with the first 5–7 days of viral shedding. Tests with sensitivity below 50% could face significant concerns.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Could you explain more about sensitivity and specificity expectations for antigen tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, so, you know, I think our expectations both for those that are prescribed tests for antigen and as well as those that are OTC, you know, and in the home environment, we've made, you know, recommendations for performance at least for sensitivity or PPA quite clear. You know, that we would like to see at least 80% sensitivity for a single result compared to a high sensitivity molecular test at least during the period of time when an individual is considered to be infectious. So, you know, that period is when we typically think, you know, after infection and when they begin to shed virus and perhaps the first five to seven days of shedding - and at least that's the period that I correlate with symptoms for those patients who do have symptoms. We would like to see that, you know, overall that at least 80% sensitivity for that period. That's does mean that potentially during that period your test is missing 20% of people who could be infectious. FDA Virtual Townhall And then, you know, certainly we've heard arguments made in the public arena for authorizing much lower sensitivity tests, significantly below 50% and as low as 30%, or even lower. And, you know, if a test misses more than 50% of the people who could be infected, we would have serious concerns about that kind of test.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Franco Calderon
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: sensitivity expectations, specificity expectations, antigen test performance
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 5-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Should LOD for antigen tests be a primary focus or is overall clinical performance more important?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA views LOD as less critical than overall clinical study performance, including sensitivity and specificity. Although LOD is required, it is challenging to harmonize and is secondary in importance.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Should LOD for antigen tests be a primary focus or is overall clinical performance more important?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Is LOD, you know, probably many outside the FDA have made more deal of LOD than we do. First of all, if there's not an easy way to harmonize how LODs experiments are performed. It's very hard for us to assess individual LOD determinations. We do require it. We expect you to do it but it is a lesser review item than for actual clinical study performance. That is, what is your sensitivity, and what is your specificity?

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the FDA provide any resources or recommendations to find a CLIA lab for U.S. validation?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA does not directly recommend or provide specific resources for finding a CLIA lab. However, contract research organizations may be helpful. Testing can be done outside the U.S. but must target the U.S. population, requiring presentation in English or possibly Spanish.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA provide any resources or recommendations to find a CLIA lab for U.S. validation?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, we have heard that there are some contract research organizations out there that have been very helpful to developers and we don't give out recommendations for how to use. But certainly, that's a pool of folks who can potentially help. I think what you're probably talking about is doing the point of care study to demonstrate that non-laboratory users from the point of care settings can perform the test accurately. And while we would love to see that work done in the United States, that's not a formal requirement. It is a requirement though to do that testing in English and perhaps even in Spanish.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the FDA allow for serial testing strategies to compensate for lower sensitivity antigen tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA allows for using serial testing strategies, such as performing multiple tests on the same person over a period of time, to compensate for lower sensitivity of individual tests. This combined performance may meet FDA requirements for authorization.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA allow for serial testing strategies to compensate for lower sensitivity antigen tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Now we are open as Dr. Shuren and I expressed in the recent op-ed in The Hill to using serial testing. It's very possible that to test that individually might have performance below our recommendations say 70% PTA. That if used in serial testing, perhaps a two-pack, you know, two tests in a pack then would rely on testing twice the same individual twice over a set period of time. Maybe day one, day two, day one, day three, something like that. And we've expressed, you know, very much flexibility to say, we can look at the combined performance of such a strategy. And if it does do an excellent job of hitting us, you know, a minimum recommendation then we could consider that for authorization.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the minimum acceptable sensitivity for FDA authorization of COVID-19 diagnostic tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends a minimum sensitivity of at least 80% for COVID-19 diagnostic tests during the infectious period, typically within the first five to seven days of virus shedding.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the minimum acceptable sensitivity for FDA authorization of COVID-19 diagnostic tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, so, you know, I think our expectations both for those that are prescribed tests for antigen and as well as those that are OTC, you know, and in the home environment, we've made, you know, recommendations for performance at least for sensitivity or PPA quite clear. You know, that we would like to see at least 80% sensitivity for a single result compared to a high sensitivity molecular test at least during the period of time when an individual is considered to be infectious. So, you know, that period is when we typically think, you know, after infection and when they begin to shed virus and perhaps the first five to seven days of shedding - and at least that's the period that I correlate with symptoms for those patients who do have symptoms. We would like to see that, you know, overall that at least 80% sensitivity for that period. That's does mean that potentially during that period your test is missing 20% of people who could be infectious.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What constitutes a CLIA-waived environment for conducting point of care studies?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: A CLIA-waived environment is a non-laboratory setting where non-laboratory healthcare professionals conduct the test. It includes locations like schools, businesses, or nursing homes, typically by individuals who have acquired a CLIA waiver.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What constitutes a CLIA-waived environment for conducting point of care studies?
VERBATIM ANSWER: …that is not in a laboratory - not in a laboratory with formally laboratory trained people. But if you've done it in a CLIA waived environment, with non- laboratory healthcare professionals. So it's all in how the study was carried out in the target population because when we deem a test as CLIA waived, we expect that test will then be performed by non-laboratory users Even these days by say, officials at schools and businesses who have never or even nursing homes who have never done this kind of testing before, and they have newly acquired a certificate or waiver from CMS CLIA.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Are there specific requirements for conducting studies in English or Spanish to meet FDA expectations for U.S. populations?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, we have heard that there are some contract research organizations out there that have been very helpful to developers and we don't give out recommendations for how to use. But certainly, that's a pool of folks who can potentially help. I think what you're probably talking about is doing the point of care study to demonstrate that non-laboratory users from the point of care settings can perform the test accurately. And while we would love to see that work done in the United States, that's not a formal requirement. It is a requirement though to do that testing in English and perhaps even in Spanish.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Will the FDA provide guidance on converting pre-EUA submissions into a different regulatory pathway if EUAs are phased out?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, that's a really excellent question. And I don't have an answer. I'm not sure if Toby does, either. I mean certainly, you know, we have a number of open emergency authorizations from prior emergencies still and we have not closed those down from an agency perspective. We would support a very amenable transition plan so that those that have developed tests that could, you know, help out here. So, you know, for those that have already been authorized, there's a question for them. Specifically, I don't have a ready answer for those that have submitted but hadn't been authorized. Except to say that it's from our perspective we want to have a smooth transition and we want to give all developers who want to make that transition in general sufficient time to convert.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What steps is the FDA taking to ensure efficient review of submissions given the increased volume?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is focusing on efficient review by leveraging more templates, validation recommendations, and clear expectations to streamline discussions with developers and accelerate application processing.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What steps is the FDA taking to ensure efficient review of submissions given the increased volume?
VERBATIM ANSWER: That had to do with, you know, our ability to spend as much individual time with the developer as we may have had in the past or taken in the past. It had nothing to do with the transition and everything to do with the fact that as the number of submissions is growing, our desire to get through them as fast as possible. And now that we have a lot more templates and recommendations for validations and very clear recommendations and expectations, we think that due to that work that our conversations with individual developers can be much more efficient. And that will help us speed through the applications.

QA Block 1-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What steps can developers take to submit higher quality EUA applications?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA advises developers to ensure EUA applications are complete, well-organized, and include validation protocols. Poor submissions slow down reviews. Updates or corrections to previous submissions are encouraged, and timely responses to FDA queries are crucial for efficient processing.
VERBATIM QUESTION: IMPLICIT
VERBATIM ANSWER: Okay, I wanted to speak about the quality of EUA submission. So it's important to have a complete, well-organized submission, including your validation protocols so we know that's how your validations were performed and whether or not those were accurately and correctly done. Those are all important in order for us to move swiftly towards an authorization decision. You know, our expert reviewers have expressed to me a growing frequency of getting bogged down with less than optimal submissions. And they have spent valuable time working with these developers in trying to help. And the process, of course, has delayed review of other applications. We're in a new phase now and we've authorized quite a few tests. And therefore we are going to take steps to correct the situation so that we can work through all submissions as quickly as possible. So please take steps to have, you know, the best quality submissions. If you've already submitted and you want to update and make updates to it, please do. And then when we have questions, please address them directly and clearly and as quickly and as completely as possible. So that we can work through those submissions with you and then move on to the others as quickly as possible. So I thank you all in advance for help with this.

VERBATIM QUESTION: How can developers access the most current FDA thoughts and recommendations on at-home serology testing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We are working on a template specifically for that. And we have enough built up thoughts about that to be able to provide, via the templates email address, with some recommendations. So if you reach out to the template's email address and ask for the home testing serology recommendations then one of our team members can assist you with the best possible and most up-to-date recommendations that we have.

QA Block 5-6
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the requirements for point of care studies to be acceptable for FDA submission?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA requires point of care studies to show that non-laboratory users can accurately perform tests. While U.S. data is preferred, it is not mandatory. Testing must be conducted in English and possibly Spanish for the U.S. population.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the requirements for point of care studies to be acceptable for FDA submission?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, we have heard that there are some contract research organizations out there that have been very helpful to developers and we don't give out recommendations for how to use. But certainly, that's a pool of folks who can potentially help. I think what you're probably talking about is doing the point of care study to demonstrate that non-laboratory users from the point of care settings can perform the test accurately. And while we would love to see that work done in the United States, that's not a formal requirement. It is a requirement though to do that testing in English and perhaps even in Spanish. I'd looked at the template because that's the US target population.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Will submissions already in the EUA queue be transitioned or rejected if the EUA program ends?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, that's a really excellent question. And I don't have an answer. I'm not sure if Toby does, either. I mean certainly, you know, we have a number of open emergency authorizations from prior emergencies still and we have not closed those down from an agency perspective. We would support a very amenable transition plan so that those that have developed tests that could, you know, help out here. So, you know, for those that have already been authorized, there's a question for them. Specifically, I don't have a ready answer for those that have submitted but hadn't been authorized. Except to say that it's from our perspective we want to have a smooth transition and we want to give all developers who want to make that transition in general sufficient time to convert.
