#### 1. FDA Updates on At-Home SARS-CoV-2 Test Authorizations

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the key performance requirements for a home-based COVID-19 diagnostic test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Key performance requirements for a home-based COVID-19 diagnostic test include adequate performance on 30 symptomatic patients for prescription use and a minimum of 10 asymptomatic positives for over-the-counter use. Additional asymptomatic positives can be obtained post-authorization. Combining usability, user comprehension, and clinical studies can increase efficiency, and point-of-care studies are not mandatory if only home use is targeted.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the key performance requirements for a home-based COVID-19 diagnostic test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. A pleasure to join all of you again today. Thanks for all that you're doing. We want to help you and speed access to additional diagnostics. So to - you know, we again, emphasize our priorities in particular home tests, is very, very important for us right now, either prescription or over-the-counter, whatever developers choose to come in with. FDA Virtual TH I do have a suggestion. It's just a suggestion, not a recommendation, but if you are developing a test that you envision can perform in the home, if you go straight to the home study, and don't do point-of-care studies, if we're able to authorize based on the home studies, you automatically get the point-of-care authorization as well. So that is probably going to be a more efficient pathway, if you have high confidence in your test to be able to perform in the home, and you're ultimately going there, you cut out all those point-of-care studies, and you go right to the home user. I also suggest, not necessarily recommend, because there is some risk to this, is that when you do the home clinical studies, that you overlap with that the same participants' usability study, user comprehension, with the clinical study. So that will potentially make it a lot more efficient, fewer patients to enroll in your overall studies, you combine all those things. Don't forget the flex studies that are called for point-of-care. Those are also needed for home. And - yes. And so, you know, to get into the home, it just requires adequate performance on 30 symptomatic patients, and that would be for a prescription. And then for over-the-counter, we'd like to see a minimum of 10 asymptomatic positives. And then any additional asymptomatic positives that we'd like to see, can be obtained post authorization. So again, you know, we'd really like to see more home applications, either for a prescription or over-the-counter. And if it is more efficient for you to FDA Virtual TH bypass the point-of-care studies in CLIA waived clinics, that works for us as well.

#### 7. Requirements for Adding Asymptomatic Claims to OTC Tests

QA Block 7-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can a study adding an asymptomatic claim to an authorized symptomatic claim be performed in a nonclinical setting such as an employer testing site?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: A study can be done in a nonclinical setting, such as a workplace or school, if it involves a simulated environment mimicking home use or unbiased testing through a surveillance or screening program.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can a study adding an asymptomatic claim to an authorized symptomatic claim be performed in a nonclinical setting such as an employer testing site?
VERBATIM ANSWER: You can connect with a surveillance or screening program, as long as you do the subsequent testing in an unbiased way. So, getting the positives in asymptomatic situation is what we hear is more challenging than getting, you know, 100 negatives, which is pretty easy to get. And you can do that testing, either you can send it to the home user and they FDA Virtual TH can do it entirely in their home, or you can set up simulated environments, and if you want to use schools or workplaces to enroll people, as long as you simulate how a home user would use that when you hand them over the test, that works for us.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: If the original clinical data is used to train the new algorithm, it would not suffice; an independent dataset must be used for training while the original can validate. Developers can submit pre-approved change protocols for easier updates. FDA considers total evidence, requiring 90% PPA for OTC use.
