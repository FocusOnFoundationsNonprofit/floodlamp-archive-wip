#### 1. False Positives and Testing Accuracy in SARS-CoV-2 Diagnostics

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How can test developers address concerns related to false positive results for COVID-19 diagnostic tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA collaborates with test developers to investigate and address reported false positives, resolve confirmed issues, and ensure transparency in communicating findings.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How can test developers address concerns related to false positive results for COVID-19 diagnostic tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: A topic that seems to be well-recognized now and we certainly made some public statements about certain tests is false positives so we are still dealing with some tests that have been publicly mentioned by the FDA and we continue to look for all signals whether they be significant false negatives or false positives and certainly pay a lot of attention to any sort of false results, work with those who are reporting issues as well as the test developers, understand the issues, see if there truly is an issue and if so, to quickly resolve that and quell that. And of course when something is known and decided to make that transparent to all of you, but in general false positives perhaps haven't received as much attention as false negatives but as we move into this pandemic and the response, you know, false positives are important to be aware of.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: False positives, Collaboration with developers, Communication of issues
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What steps should be taken to ensure accurate sensitivity and specificity calculations for tests in low-prevalence populations?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: To ensure accurate test results for low-prevalence populations, it is crucial to understand both the sensitivity and specificity of the tests and to assess their positive predictive value for the specific population being tested.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What steps should be taken to ensure accurate sensitivity and specificity calculations for tests in low-prevalence populations?
VERBATIM ANSWER: It's really important to not only understand the sensitivity and specificity of tests to the best of our ability but it's also important to understand what the positive predictive value for the population in that you're testing.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Sensitivity and specificity in testing, Positive predictive value, Low-prevalence population testing
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How does the positive predictive value (PPV) change with varying population positivity rates when using high-performing tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The positive predictive value (PPV) significantly decreases in low positivity rate populations even with high-performing tests. For instance, a test with 95% sensitivity and 99% specificity in a population with a 0.2% positivity rate yields a PPV of only 16%, meaning one in six positives is truly positive.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How does the positive predictive value (PPV) change with varying population positivity rates when using high-performing tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: As we've talked about previously a while ago for serology tests even if molecular tests or an antigen test is quite specific and let's just plug-in some numbers into our PPV calculator and so if you plug-in a 95% sensitivity and a 99% specificity against the sensitivity 95 and specificity 99 so many would agree that's a fairly high-performing test. And if you put in a number of perhaps 0.2% positive but again that's 0.2, we have seen that relative level of positivity in a number of different populations who are doing screening or they're doing surveillance, you know, it's interesting because you plug that into a calculator for PPV or positive predictive value it's 1/6 or 16% and that's pretty low. That means that only one out of six positives is an actually true positive result.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Positive predictive value, Population positivity rates, Test performance
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What guidance or tools does the FDA provide for testing positive predictive value in specific populations?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA provides a Positive Predictive Value (PPV) calculator to assess test performance in specific populations, using sensitivity, specificity, and population positivity rates.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What guidance or tools does the FDA provide for testing positive predictive value in specific populations?
VERBATIM ANSWER: And as we've talked about previously a while ago for serology tests even if molecular tests or an antigen test is quite specific and let's just plug-in some numbers into our PPV calculator and so if you plug-in a 95% sensitivity and a 99% specificity against the sensitivity 95 and specificity 99 so many would agree that's a fairly high-performing test.

TOPICS: Positive Predictive Value, Diagnostic tools, Population-specific testing
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-5
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the implications of falsely positive results on patient placement in clinical settings, such as COVID-19 wards?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Falsely positive results can lead to patients being placed in COVID wards where they risk being exposed to infectious individuals. This is especially concerning for at-risk patients, emphasizing the importance of understanding test sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the implications of falsely positive results on patient placement in clinical settings, such as COVID-19 wards?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We know that in some clinical settings based on a single positive result that patients can be moved into a COVID ward where presumably everybody else has been confirmed positive to have COVID and may carry the virus, may carry infectious levels of the virus, may increase the risk of transmissibility to anyone who goes into that ward and here you'll have a potential patient who is falsely positive, may be in an at-risk group due to the age or previous conditions and goes into that increased-risk ward or area and may unfortunately, you know, contract the disease. So it's really important to not only understand the sensitivity and specificity of tests to the best of our ability but it's also important to understand what the positive predictive value for the population in that you're testing so let's hope that those remarks are helpful.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: False positives, Patient placement risks, Test sensitivity and specificity
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-6
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How can developers access and utilize the FDA SARS reference panel data for evaluating their tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA has provided publicly available information on the SARS reference panel, including tables assessing relative LODs for different sample types (e.g., VTM, dry swabs, saliva), organized for ease of understanding. Developers are advised to review these details when interpreting data and making comparisons.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How can developers access and utilize the FDA SARS reference panel data for evaluating their tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We assessed relative LODs in three different ways, one for essentially the sample that used or test that uses - sample test that use - VTM and go into an extraction sort of chemistry from a liquid source and then we looked at dry swabs and separately we started looking at saliva. We think that within a sample type, we have three different tables and that's publicly available information. Within a table you can look at relative LOD and you can understand I think to a great degree based on how we ask the testing to be done and our analysis, we have a pretty good rank order, a lower LOD to a higher LOD within a table but making comparisons between tables are a little bit more difficult because the method of assessing the LOD was not exactly the same and we do put some details about how those how the panel was used for the different sample types so that those that go to the table and try to use it understand what those differences may be. So again we hope this publicly-available information on relative LODs will be helpful to the community.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: FDA SARS reference panel, Test evaluation, LOD data
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-7
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What distinctions should be noted when comparing limit of detection (LOD) across different sample types like dry swabs, saliva, and VTM?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA evaluated relative LODs for VTM, dry swabs, and saliva using distinct methods, resulting in separate tables. LOD comparisons within each sample type are reliable, but comparing across sample types is challenging due to differing assessment methods.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What distinctions should be noted when comparing limit of detection (LOD) across different sample types like dry swabs, saliva, and VTM?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We assessed relative LODs in three different ways, one for essentially the sample that used or test that uses - sample test that use - VTM and go into an extraction sort of chemistry from a liquid source and then we looked at dry swabs and separately we started looking at saliva.

SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Limit of detection, Sample types, FDA SARS reference panel
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-8
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are the methods for assessing LOD standardized across all sample types listed in the FDA SARS reference panel?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA assessed LOD in three different ways for different sample types: VTM with liquid extraction, dry swabs, and saliva. While LOD rankings are consistent within each sample type, comparing LOD across types is challenging due to differing assessment methods.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are the methods for assessing LOD standardized across all sample types listed in the FDA SARS reference panel?

QA Block 1-9
CLARIFIED QUESTION: When can developers expect the next batch of SARS reference panel results to be posted?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is finalizing LOD determinations for additional developers and will post the next batch of SARS reference panel results as soon as they are ready.
VERBATIM QUESTION: When can developers expect the next batch of SARS reference panel results to be posted?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We have contacted a lot more developers in this first batch and so we're already working on finalizing LOD determinations for a lot more and we'll post as soon as we're ready to post the next batch.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE

TOPICS: SARS reference panel, Next batch posting timeline
REVIEW FLAG: False


#### 2. Updating Notification Lists and Standard Protocol Practices

QA Block 2-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are you still updating the notification lists on your facts page regularly?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is updating the notification lists regularly, although some listings, such as Section A, are voluntary and require permission from the submitter for inclusion.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are you still updating the notification lists on your facts page regularly?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, we are. I'll double-check on that. I will say that there are some of those, I believe A is voluntary to be listed there so just because somebody has let us know that they validated and may wish to pursue an EUA may at the same time may not give us permission to put it on the notification list but I'll make a note of that to double-check that that is the standard protocol for us to update those notification lists.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Alexis Sauer-Budge
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: notification list updates, EUA process, submission protocol
REVIEW FLAG: False


#### 3. Submitting and Updating EUA for Antigen Tests

QA Block 3-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Do we submit one EUA and modify it or do we have to submit two EUAs?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The decision is up to the submitter. If you have complete data for a sample type and want an earlier EUA authorization, you can submit it and later amend it with additional validations. The FDA allows updates to EUAs and recommends submitting validated data for antigen tests promptly.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Do we submit one EUA and modify it or do we have to submit two EUAs?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So that's totally up to you. I you know, when you have a complete set of data for a particular sample type and you'd like to get you know, an EUA authorization sooner than later, then you may want to submit that before you have all your sample type validations, all the different sample types you want and the validations, the types you want and the validations done. Because we, you know, once an EUA is authorized, we do allow updates to it, right, amendments to it with any changes that would require or new or we recommend new validation. If you've already got some sample types where you definitely met our recommended minimums and the data looks good, then go ahead. I encourage you to go ahead and submit it particularly for antigen tests because we certainly want to have more antigen tests on the market as soon as possible.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Louis Perlmutter
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: EUA submission process, Validation for sample types, Antigen tests
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 3-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the recommended minimum criteria for sample type validation?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends submitting data that meets its minimum criteria for sample type validation and looks scientifically sound, particularly for antigen tests.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the recommended minimum criteria for sample type validation?
VERBATIM ANSWER: If you've already got some sample types where you definitely met our recommended minimums and the data looks good, then go ahead. I encourage you to go ahead and submit it particularly for antigen tests because we certainly want to have more antigen tests on the market as soon as possible.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: validation criteria, sample types, antigen tests
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 3-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can updates or amendments to an EUA be submitted for additional sample types after the initial authorization?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA allows updates or amendments to an EUA for additional sample types, provided any required new validation is included.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can updates or amendments to an EUA be submitted for additional sample types after the initial authorization?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Because we, you know, once an EUA is authorized, we do allow updates to it, right, amendments to it with any changes that would require or new or we recommend new validation.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Louis Perlmutter
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: EUA amendments, sample type validation
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 3-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the FDA prioritize antigen test EUAs to expedite market availability?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA encourages the submission of antigen tests to increase their market availability as soon as possible.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA prioritize antigen test EUAs to expedite market availability?
VERBATIM ANSWER: I encourage you to go ahead and submit it particularly for antigen tests because we certainly want to have more antigen tests on the market as soon as possible.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: antigen test EUAs, FDA prioritization
REVIEW FLAG: False


#### 4. FDA Requirements and Flexibility for At-Home COVID-19 Tests

QA Block 4-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the standard lab test against which a manufacturer should compare their at-home antigen tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The standard lab test for comparing at-home antigen tests is generally considered to be a high-sensitivity molecular test, as the FDA aims to compare against the best possible standard.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the standard lab test against which a manufacturer should compare their at-home antigen tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So the question of what is the comparator test is what you're asking, what is the standard lab test and this is typically thought and the outline behind this is a high-sensitivity molecular test. We specify that because we don't want to be comparing something less than the best possible standard and if you go with a less-sensitive test, it may not detect all cases.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Paul Barto
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: standard lab test for comparison, high-sensitivity molecular tests
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 4-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are visually read tests excluded since there isn't a way to automatically report results to a public health agency?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Visually read tests are not excluded because home tests performed outside of a CLIA lab are not legally required to report results to public health agencies. FDA encourages developers to explore ways to facilitate result reporting to aid the public health response.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are visually read tests excluded since there isn't a way to automatically report results to a public health agency?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So home tests performed outside of a CLIA lab are not required to report results to the reporting agencies. It's not required by law is my understanding. We do want to stimulate thought about how the tests can be reported in order to aid our public health response to this pandemic so we do in that template ask what are your thoughts about how you can facilitate reporting of results even in a home test situation.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Paul Barto
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Visually read tests, Reporting results, Public health requirements
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 4-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Why does the FDA template include a question about reporting test results to public health agencies if it is not a requirement?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA includes this question in the template to stimulate ideas for reporting home test results to aid pandemic tracking, but it is not a requirement for test authorization.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Why does the FDA template include a question about reporting test results to public health agencies if it is not a requirement?
VERBATIM ANSWER: It is not a requirement. It is not something that we would use to make a decision on whether or not to authorize that test or not. It is a question in the template and that's because we are trying to be a good federal partner and stimulate thought in this area because we think that it's a very responsible thing to do and try to find a way to report these results so that we're tracking the pandemic as best we can.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Paul Barto
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: FDA test result reporting, Public health tracking, Test authorization requirements
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 4-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is it mandatory for at-home COVID-19 tests to have a means to report results to public health agencies for FDA authorization?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA does not require at-home COVID-19 tests to have a means of reporting results to public health agencies for authorization. It is suggested in the template to encourage public health tracking.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is it mandatory for at-home COVID-19 tests to have a means to report results to public health agencies for FDA authorization?
VERBATIM ANSWER: It is not a requirement. It is not something that we would use to make a decision on whether or not to authorize that test or not. It is a question in the template and that's because we are trying to be a good federal partner and stimulate thought in this area because we think that it's a very responsible thing to do and try to find a way to report these results so that we're tracking the pandemic as best we can.

TOPICS: At-home COVID-19 test requirements, Reporting test results, FDA authorization
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 4-5
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What alternative methods can be used to validate at-home COVID-19 antigen tests if the recommendations in the FDA templates are not followed?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is open to alternative methods of validation for at-home COVID-19 antigen tests beyond those recommended in its templates.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What alternative methods can be used to validate at-home COVID-19 antigen tests if the recommendations in the FDA templates are not followed?
VERBATIM ANSWER: There may be alternatives to get to the same place of validation and we're always open to those alternatives. We have given a lot of thought to what the recommendations are in our templates by the time we post them.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Validation methods, At-home COVID-19 tests, FDA flexibility
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 4-6
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the sensitivity requirements for prescription-only at-home COVID-19 antigen tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: For prescription-only at-home COVID-19 antigen tests, the FDA recommends a sensitivity of 80%, though it may allow lower sensitivities (70% or more) in serial testing programs.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the sensitivity requirements for prescription-only at-home COVID-19 antigen tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So I'm going to try to unpack these things one at a time and if I miss some thing, please let me know at the end so you mentioned that at-home test we had the recommended positive agreement or sensitivity of 90%. That is for something that is going to be over-the-counter without prescription. So if there is something that's by-prescription then the recommended PPA or sensitivity is 80% and in fact if you're read Dr. Shuren's and my opinion last week in The Hill, we even suggested something as far as a single test result in the home situation can be as low as 70% perhaps if you had something like a serial test program where instead of just one test result you might have two. You might package two tests and a patient might test themselves on Day 1 and Day 2 or Day 1 and Day 3, whatever the developer, you know, sees as beneficial to increasing that sensitivity.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: sensitivity requirements, at-home COVID-19 tests, prescription-only tests
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 4-7
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can the sensitivity threshold for over-the-counter at-home tests be reduced if a serial testing approach is implemented?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA acknowledges that the sensitivity threshold for at-home over-the-counter tests could be reduced to as low as 70% if a serial testing approach is implemented, such as packaging two tests for use on different days to increase accuracy.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can the sensitivity threshold for over-the-counter at-home tests be reduced if a serial testing approach is implemented?
VERBATIM ANSWER: In fact if you're read Dr. Shuren's and my opinion last week in The Hill, we even suggested something as far as a single test result in the home situation can be as low as 70% perhaps if you had something like a serial test program where instead of just one test result you might have two.

REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 4-8
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Why has the FDA not received any EUA (Emergency Use Authorization) applications for at-home tests despite publishing guidance?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA has not received any EUA applications for at-home tests despite having templates available and expressing flexibility.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Why has the FDA not received any EUA (Emergency Use Authorization) applications for at-home tests despite publishing guidance?
VERBATIM ANSWER: I have to say though we haven't received a single EUA application for a home test, not one and we've had our template out there for a long time and we've clearly expressed flexibility so we want to reiterate. We want to see home test submissions and we're willing to be very flexible here.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: EUA applications, At-home tests, FDA guidance
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 4-9
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is it necessary for rapid antigen or point-of-care molecular tests to demonstrate peak sensitivity during specific symptomatic days (e.g., first five to seven days after symptom onset)?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA emphasizes the importance of evaluating rapid antigen and point-of-care molecular tests for sensitivity during the first five to seven days after symptom onset, as these are the peak days for potential virus transmission.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is it necessary for rapid antigen or point-of-care molecular tests to demonstrate peak sensitivity during specific symptomatic days (e.g., first five to seven days after symptom onset)?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The other thing to note is that if it's a rapid antigen test or even a point-of-care molecular test, we really are most concerned about the performance of that test that is its sensitivity against you know, a good comparator in those first five to seven days for those who are symptomatic and the first five to seven days after somebody becomes symptomatic. And that's because those are the days that we think and I think there's good literature to support this that that's the peak period of potential ability of those individuals to transfer the virus to somebody else and so we want to definitely identify those people and in the asymptomatic population we want to identify people with similar levels of virus.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Test sensitivity, Symptomatic period, Virus transmission
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 4-10
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How does the FDA evaluate the performance of tests for identifying asymptomatic individuals who may spread the virus?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA evaluates tests for identifying asymptomatic individuals by focusing on their sensitivity to identify those with transmissible levels of the virus, especially during peak periods for virus spread. They don't rely heavily on LOD since there is no international standard, and the relationship with clinical performance can vary.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How does the FDA evaluate the performance of tests for identifying asymptomatic individuals who may spread the virus?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The other thing to note is that if it's a rapid antigen test or even a point-of-care molecular test, we really are most concerned about the performance of that test that is its sensitivity against you know, a good comparator in those first five to seven days for those who are symptomatic and the first five to seven days after somebody becomes symptomatic. And that's because those are the days that we think and I think there's good literature to support this that that's the peak period of potential ability of those individuals to transfer the virus to somebody else and so we want to definitely identify those people and in the asymptomatic population we want to identify people with similar levels of virus and so we don't look in particular at LOD for a number of reasons. One is there's no international standard so it's really hard to set something that can be applied evenly across all technologies and developers but also it's not always the direct relationship between LOD and clinical performance especially if you want to be sure and identify people who have transmissible levels of virus. You may not need to have the ultimate in sensitivity as far as limited protection goes but you do want to detect those that are most likely to be able to pass-on that virus to somebody else.

TOPICS: test performance evaluation, asymptomatic transmission, FDA standards
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 4-11
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Why does the FDA avoid using LOD (Limit of Detection) as a primary metric for test validation?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA does not prioritize LOD as a key validation metric due to the lack of an international standard and its inconsistent correlation with clinical performance, especially for detecting transmissible virus levels critical for public health.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Why does the FDA avoid using LOD (Limit of Detection) as a primary metric for test validation?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We don't look in particular at LOD for a number of reasons.

QA Block 4-12
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the specific criteria for the FDA to authorize visually-read COVID-19 tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA has authorized only one visually-read test so far, the Abbott BinaxNow, which has shown good performance. The agency is optimistic about more visually-read tests entering the market soon and considers such tests valid diagnostics.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the specific criteria for the FDA to authorize visually-read COVID-19 tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We haven't authorized, I mean, we've probably authorized just one visually-read test. There is a lot I know in development and hopefully they will come to the market in the relatively near future and there's nothing wrong with the visually-read tests first of all and now the Abbott BinaxNow is a visually-read test and its performance looks good and we look forward to its full availability in the market and the usefulness in this pandemic.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Paul Barto
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: FDA criteria for visually-read tests, Authorization of Abbott BinaxNow, Future visually-read test development

QA Block 4-13
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is there a difference in how the FDA evaluates visually-read tests compared to other point-of-care tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA has authorized very few visually-read tests but sees no issue with them. The Abbott BinaxNow is an example of a visually-read test with good performance.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is there a difference in how the FDA evaluates visually-read tests compared to other point-of-care tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So we haven't authorized, I mean, we've probably authorized just one visually-read test. There is a lot I know in development and hopefully they will come to the market in the relatively near future and there's nothing wrong with the visually-read tests first of all and now the Abbott BinaxNow is a visually-read test and its performance looks good and we look forward to its full availability in the market and the usefulness in this pandemic.

#### 5. Asymptomatic Test Validation Challenges and Flexibility in FDA Guidelines

QA Block 5-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are there any studies or results on infectivity level and viral load for symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals that can inform developers?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Studies show asymptomatic individuals typically have lower viral loads than symptomatic ones, though data varies. Consistent performance evaluation is challenging due to differences in symptom onset and exposure tracking.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are there any studies or results on infectivity level and viral load for symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals that can inform developers?

Sometimes they don't appear to be different but we don't understand but clearly we see populations where the asymptomatic levels are lower. And you don't have the framework or the guard posts of knowing when somebody's infected unless they had a known exposure that you're then following and tracking them with, you know, because they don't have symptoms so you can't have the same guideposts that we can have for evaluating test performance in symptomatic populations where for example with direct antigen tests, we very specifically ask you to collect in day after symptom onset information as well as day after PCR test results so that we can start to define when is the peak performance days after symptom onset for point of care tests?

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the FDA's criteria for evaluating tests for asymptomatic individuals?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends validation of tests for asymptomatic individuals by using appropriately marked asymptomatic samples, whether banked or from prospective collection. Enrichment studies, such as those from schools or workplaces, are acceptable to efficiently gather samples. The FDA allows flexibility, including enriched pre-market data from asymptomatic individuals and post-market collection to evaluate asymptomatic claims. Matching symptomatic and asymptomatic study populations, particularly by CT values, is encouraged.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the FDA's criteria for evaluating tests for asymptomatic individuals?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So here's what we've outlined as what we would like to see as recommended validation of asymptomatic and that is we would like you to collect asymptomatics. Those can be very if you already have a test on the market and people are submitting samples and some of them are clearly marked asymptomatic, we are fine with banked samples. If you have CT results and you look at your population of asymptomatics and, you know, and in the population that your test is looking at, it's appropriate population for whatever claims you're going after and those two populations look very similar and that's also retrospective data but it's also some of that information that we're willing to put, you plan a prospective study. We are allowing enrichment studies so there's lots of schools, workplaces, universities that are doing surveillance and/or screening that are identifying asymptomatic positives and hopefully they're willing to team-up with test developers and so you don't have to do, you can enrich, you know, and find those asymptomatic much more quickly if you can team up with an effort like that and if you can't use the residual sample collected on that individual who's positive, And then you could under the appropriate, you know, consent, we'll say, not that that's necessarily an FDA requirement just you want to do it right due to local-state-federal law you can re-contact that individual, have them come in or go to them or send them a kit and have them retest themselves hopefully within a short period of time after they were positive in their screening or surveillance to add to your asymptomatic population. We do want to see what the molecular results are for that. We also have recently expressed that our interest to even be more flexible on the pre- market, on the pre-authorization side to allow enrichment of asymptomatics so typically if you're adding an asymptomatic claim, it might be 20 patients that we want to see pre-market and now we're saying that if only if it's 20 that we would allow half, 10 of those to be asymptomatic and then add to that with matched symptomatic and a good matching scheme would be to look at people with similar CTs. And then post-market after you've been authorized, complete your prospective collection of asymptomatics. We take that totality of evidence into play so if you have a really great looking test in the symptomatic population and, you know, in those first five to seven days you, you know, you do really well, you know, we're going to take that into account when we look at asymptomatics because clearly in this population where we know that they can pass the virus along and you're doing well, we just want to see is there any differences in sample type that you're using the way you're collecting in an asymptomatic population that brings-up any concerns? So again these are recommendations in our templates.

QA Block 7-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: If rapid testing is offered to facilities like employers or nursing homes, is it within the limits to use those as a screening test and then perform confirmatory testing for positive results?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA agrees that confirmatory testing for positive results from rapid screenings is advisable in low positive incidence settings. Ensure compliance with CLIA and CMS regulations for point-of-care testing.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If rapid testing is offered to facilities like employers or nursing homes, is it within the limits to use those as a screening test and then perform confirmatory testing for positive results?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, so you're really talking as I made an intro into today's conversation about a low percent positive situation where you're likely to have even if the test has a fairly high specificity, the chances are greater than none that not that a positive result is a false positive, not because it's necessarily a bad test. It's just that the incidence of positives in that population is so low so doing a confirmatory test in that situation makes absolute sense to me and then I would just, you know, be aware of the CLIA CMS regulations on the certificate, you know, for that testing is, requirements for that testing is being performed with that point of care waived test.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does a screening test for employers or nursing homes require a lab with a CLIA certificate, whether it's a waiver or otherwise?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Yes, a screening test requires testing and reporting to be done in a lab with a CLIA certificate, whether it is a waiver or not.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does a screening test for employers or nursing homes require a lab with a CLIA certificate, whether it's a waiver or otherwise?
VERBATIM ANSWER: If it's clearly been defined as screening, then that testing and the reporting is required to be done in the lab that has the CLIA certificate whether it's waiver or otherwise so I would point to those FAQs on our Website. If those don't answer your questions and you don't know whether you fit into the screening or surveillance, then I would urge you to send us an e-mail at the cdrh-eua- templates@fda.hhs.gov site and with specifics and we'll do our best to give you a very clear answer.

QA Block 1-10
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the specific details about the methods used in assessing LOD for the FDA SARS reference panel?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA assessed LODs for the SARS reference panel using three methods: testing samples with VTM and liquid extraction chemistry, dry swabs, and saliva. Results are in publicly available tables ranked by LOD within each sample type, though comparing across tables is challenging due to differing methodologies.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the specific details about the methods used in assessing LOD for the FDA SARS reference panel?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We assessed relative LODs in three different ways, one for essentially the sample that used or test that uses - sample test that use - VTM and go into an extraction sort of chemistry from a liquid source and then we looked at dry swabs and separately we started looking at saliva. We think that within a sample type, we have three different tables and that's publicly available information. Within a table you can look at relative LOD and you can understand I think to a great degree based on how we ask the testing to be done and our analysis, we have a pretty good rank order, a lower LOD to a higher LOD within a table but making comparisons between tables are a little bit more difficult because the method of assessing the LOD was not exactly the same and we do put some details about how those how the panel was used for the different sample types so that those that go to the table and try to use it understand what those differences may be.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Do you have any plans for providing a reference panel for antigen test developers?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA is actively discussing and working towards establishing reference panels for antigen tests, but sourcing challenges make it difficult to achieve widely available panels. Efforts with international standards are ongoing.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Do you have any plans for providing a reference panel for antigen test developers?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Sure, those are absolutely great questions, we still have a very active program at NCI, our federal partners in the FDA are still testing kits that have been sent to NCI and we're moving into our third panel and are already planning the fourth panel. It has been a lot of work, doable, but a lot of work to source the samples that have sufficient volumes to create these panels at NCI, to properly vet them with the various QC testing that we do and making sure that we know their history and that we are doing the very best job that's possible to match Panel 1, Panel 2, Panel 3, Panel 4 with regard to the types and samples, the titer of the samples so that we can as best as we possible with the limited resources on some of these samples match performance expectations between the panels. So a ton of work goes into this and it would be phenomenal if we had enough samples and sample volumes to be able to do this for serology. It is quite challenging to source those samples in that kind of situation to make it widely available. It's always been a goal and it's talked about frequently within our federal partner team and anyways, they're just some real challenges in getting those samples. They're not unlimited so with the FDA reference panel that went out starting in May, after it was developed, we grew up at the FDA virus and we then inactivated, we tested that it was inactivated, and we created the panel but that is a renewable resource through culture. On the antigen side, we've definitely had this conversation with our federal partners. It is definitely something that would be ideal to have as well. It also has its challenges so we essentially you know, to do this well and we've had a program that CDC has led for a number of years relative to flu where they make an annual proficiency test panel available for various key strains of flu for primarily for rapid antigen tests but molecular tests have also been very active in using those panels to surveil. You know, flu, when you grow a virus and you create these panels, there's less perhaps concern about this as a biological agent, flu relative to SARS so there are additional considerations for SARS but it's definitely been on the plate for conversation. The other thing that I did want to follow-up isn't really a question about are these international standards. The reference panel that we sent out, as soon as the international standard for molecular is available and we're looking at potentially year-end, we will anchor the FDA reference panel to that and we'll be able to translate the results like we've posted to international in units. We think that will be a huge advance and on top of what we've already done. Similarly the international community is working on international standards for antigen tests and serology tests and so we're obviously monitoring and interact at table and doing what we can to assist in that development work and can be ready to implement the two worlds that become available when we do have some available so long-winded answer, great question, would be tremendous resources and all I can say is that we're doing our best to work on it right now.

It has been a lot of work, doable, but a lot of work to source the samples that have sufficient volumes to create these panels at NCI, to properly vet them with the various QC testing that we do and making sure that we know their history and that we are doing the very best job that's possible to match Panel 1, Panel 2, Panel 3, Panel 4 with regard to the types and samples, the titer of the samples so that we can as best as we possible with the limited resources on some of these samples match performance expectations between the panels. So a ton of work goes into this and it would be phenomenal if we had enough samples and sample volumes to be able to do this for serology. It is quite challenging to source those samples in that kind of situation to make it widely available. It's always been a goal and it's talked about frequently within our federal partner team and anyways, they're just some real challenges in getting those samples. They're not unlimited so with the FDA reference panel that went out starting in May, after it was developed, we grew up at the FDA virus and we then inactivated, we tested that it was inactivated, and we created the panel but that is a renewable resource through culture. On the antigen side, we've definitely had this conversation with our federal partners. It is definitely something that would be ideal to have as well. It also has its challenges so we essentially you know, to do this well and we've had a program that CDC has led for a number of years relative to flu where they make an annual proficiency test panel available for various key strains of flu for primarily for rapid antigen tests but molecular tests have also been very active in using those panels to surveil. You know, flu, when you grow a virus and you create these panels, there's less perhaps concern about this as a biological agent, flu relative to SARS so there are additional considerations for SARS but it's definitely been on the plate for conversation. The other thing that I did want to follow-up isn't really a question about are these international standards. The reference panel that we sent out, as soon as the international standard for molecular is available and we're looking at potentially year-end, we will anchor the FDA reference panel to that and we'll be able to translate the results like we've posted to international in units. We think that will be a huge advance and on top of what we've already done. Similarly the international community is working on international standards for antigen tests and serology tests and so we're obviously monitoring and interact at table and doing what we can to assist in that development work and can be ready to implement the two worlds that become available when we do have some available so long-winded answer, great question, would be tremendous resources and all I can say is that we're doing our best to work on it right now.
