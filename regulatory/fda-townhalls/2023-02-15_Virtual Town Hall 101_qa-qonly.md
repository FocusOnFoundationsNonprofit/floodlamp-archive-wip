QA Block 2-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How does the FDA plan to address the transition for test manufacturers moving from EUA conditions to traditional premarket submissions?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recognizes the need for transition time as EUAs move to traditional operations. The Public Health Emergency (319) ending in May does not directly impact the 564 declaration, which continues until HHS terminates it, and draft transition guidance is being finalized.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How does the FDA plan to address the transition for test manufacturers moving from EUA conditions to traditional premarket submissions?
VERBATIM ANSWER: As we've discussed before and as is noted in our FAQs on the website, we don't plan to take any action that would leave Americans without the tests that they need. We recognize that the manufacturers of tests that were issued EUAs will need an appropriate period of transition time to transition to normal operations when the declaration under 564 is no longer in effect, but it is important to note that only the 319 is scheduled to end on May 11th. The 564 is separate and will continue until the HHS secretary terminates it. It is not dependent upon the 319 PHE declaration. There's more information on our website in the FAQs about what happens when the 319 PHE expires, and we also have issued a draft guidance, last December, about the transition plan that is in the process of being finalized. And we received some great questions and comments during the comment period for the draft guidance, and those will be addressed in the final.

VERBATIM ANSWER: As mentioned, the administration has announced that the Public Health Emergency under 319 will end on May 11. As we've discussed before and as is noted in our FAQs on the website, we don't plan to take any action that would leave Americans without the tests that they need. We recognize that the manufacturers of tests that were issued EUAs will need an appropriate period of transition time to transition to normal operations when the declaration under 564 is no longer in effect, but it is important to note that only the 319 is scheduled to end on May 11th.

QA Block 2-6
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How does the expiration of the 319 Public Health Emergency affect the authorization process for new COVID-19 tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA clarified that the expiration of the 319 Public Health Emergency (PHE) will not immediately impact the authorization of COVID-19 tests, as the Section 564 declaration, which supports Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs), is separate and not tied to the 319 PHE. The FDA is ensuring a transition plan for test manufacturers, and guidance information is available on their website.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How does the expiration of the 319 Public Health Emergency affect the authorization process for new COVID-19 tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: In January, about a month ago, we issued a level two update, so minor policy updates, to the COVID-19 test guidance, as well as the viral mutations policy guidance. Those updates were to reflect that the guidances will be in effect for the duration of the Section 564 declaration, rather than the 319 Public Health Emergency. So that basically, affects the plan going forward-- as Tim was just talking about-- with the 319 expected to end in May, and I'll get into that a little bit more in a minute. As we've discussed before and as is noted in our FAQs on the website, we don't plan to take any action that would leave Americans without the tests that they need. We recognize that the manufacturers of tests that were issued EUAs will need an appropriate period of transition time to transition to normal operations when the declaration under 564 is no longer in effect, but it is important to note that only the 319 is scheduled to end on May 11th.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Will the updated viral mutations guidance impact the requirements for validating tests against emerging variants?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We also updated-- some minor updates in the mutations guidance. That one hadn't been updated in a while so we updated some language to match the September 2022 update to the test policy guidance-- encouraging submissions of traditional premarket review submissions, added some links to additional web resources that we've put in place since the initial version of that guidance, and updated some of the actions we've taken since that first guidance was issued.

#### 5. Authorization Requirements for Home Collection Kits and Assays

QA Block 5-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are separate Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) required for an at-home collection kit and the assay with which the home collection kit will be used?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Both the home collection kit and the assay require authorization before use. There are three options: authorization as part of a single EUA if the same developer is responsible for both; separate EUA requests if the developers differ; or a supplemental EUA to an existing molecular diagnostic test EUA to include the home collection kit.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are separate Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) required for an at-home collection kit and the assay with which the home collection kit will be used?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So both the home collection kit and the assay do need to be authorized prior to being offered. As discussed in the Molecular Diagnostic Home Specimen Collection Template, there are three general options for how to seek authorization for an at-home collection kit for use with an assay. The home collection kit can be included as part of a single EUA request for a SARS-COV-2 molecular diagnostic test. This would be appropriate generally, when the developer-- when the same developer is responsible for both the home collection kit and the molecular diagnostic test, and they're seeking authorization at the same time for that combination, of the assay and the collection kit. The second option is multiple EUA requests. This is generally, appropriate when the developer of the home collection kit is different from the developer of the molecular diagnostic assay. So they would submit separate multiple or separate EUA requests and reference each other. And then, lastly, you could have a supplemental EUA request to an EUA of a previously authorized molecular diagnostic test to add a home collection-- to add home collection with a specific home collection kit.

#### 9. FDA Guidance on Using International Flu Samples

QA Block 9-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Would the agency be willing to accept more flu samples from the Southern hemisphere for COVID-flu multiplex panels in light of the flu season winding down in the United States?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: In general, the FDA is open to accepting more flu samples from the Southern hemisphere, but there are conditions such as language requirements for testers and reflective testing conditions in line with US practices. Sponsors are advised to submit a pre-EUA for this.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Would the agency be willing to accept more flu samples from the Southern hemisphere for COVID-flu multiplex panels in light of the flu season winding down in the United States?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. In general, whenever-- and even for COVID, when COVID rates were very low at some points, we had opened up the possibility. For over-the-counter, there are important considerations for going in the Southern hemisphere. It's important that the speakers either speak English and understand written English and/or Spanish, if that's what's in the labeling, and that they not be provided instructions in their native language if it's other than Spanish or English. And this is because we won't want to test the test in the way that they would be used in the United States. And there are certain considerations around, say, point-of-care testing outside the US, that it really reflect how the US that is performed by non-laboratorians. We have seen some sponsors not understand that and say something's point-of-care, when it's tested by trained laboratorians. So the best thing to do is to submit a pre-EUA to do this. Also, there is relative openness for molecular assays for at least point-of-care to use bank samples when certain other analytes are in poor and very low-- when positives are very low for certain analytes other than COVID. COVID still, unfortunately, remains relatively prevalent in the US right now. Hopefully, that's helpful to you.

#### 11. Navigating Mpox Test Clearance and Submission Challenges

QA Block 11-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: If we decide to pursue 510(k) premarket clearance for mpox, can we use the CDC orthopox virus assay as a predicate?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Yes, the CDC orthopox virus assay can be used as a predicate since it is FDA-cleared. However, it is recommended to submit a Pre-Sub or Q-Sub for an IVD submission for mpox due to challenges like the lack of fresh samples for a full authorization submission.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If we decide to pursue 510(k) premarket clearance for mpox, can we use the CDC orthopox virus assay as a predicate?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah, so the predicate assay would be anything that's FDA cleared, and the CDC assay is cleared. As far as the comparator goes, we generally, for these kinds of tests, have allowed either the FDA cleared or EUA authorized tests. The best way to pursue this is, I would recommend that you go and submit a Pre-Sub or Q-Sub for an IVD submission for mpox. One of the big challenges right now is that there are, fortunately, so few fresh samples so that's typically needed for a full authorization submission. So unless somebody has already collected prospective fresh samples in an appropriate clinical study, it may be very challenging, which is why there are currently no plans to end the 564 for mpox, given that additional test development and finalizing test development for a full submission would be rather challenging.

#### 12. FDA's Transition Plans for COVID Test Authorizations

QA Block 12-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What process will FDA/HHS go through to determine when the 564 Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) will come to an end?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA aims to ensure test availability. A draft guidance outlines a transition process if the EUA ends, providing time for developers to submit full authorizations. Submissions in by the deadline allow products to remain on the market during review, if acceptable. Factors considered include the number of authorized tests.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What process will FDA/HHS go through to determine when the 564 Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) will come to an end?
VERBATIM ANSWER: I mean, our first goal is to make sure that the tests remain available. So along those lines, we have published a draft guidance for a transition period for when and if a 564 for COVID would end and what that would mean for developers. www.fda.gov It's envisioned that we would give developers time to get in a submission-- a full authorization submission, and it's envisioned that in a likelihood that-- it all depends on the final guidance wording, but as long as the submission is in by the deadline and the FDA continues to review that submission and there is nothing wrong with that submission, then that test can remain on the market. So overall, the most important thing is that the tests remain available. It would be quite obvious for the FDA to take a look at how many full authorizations, de novos granted, or tests cleared have been finalized and authorized by the FDA as a factor involved here.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA advises submitting a Pre-Submission for an acceptable comparator method. You may validate nasal swab comparisons for analytical sensitivity. Re-check the Cepheid test's availability for production issues.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Do we need to turn to other RT-PCR methods that use nasopharyngeal swab sample types?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Sure, yeah. Thanks, Tim. So first thing, I think you want to ask us in a Pre-Submission an acceptable comparative method. So we are open to other sample types that potentially may not be the cleared sample type or a 510k cleared test. There's opportunity to perhaps do an analytical validation between sample types and just show that you're getting the same analytical sensitivity. So you can do that nasal swab to nasal swab comparison that you're perhaps, looking for. I'm not sure if the Cepheid test you're talking about still has production challenges. I think we've heard other information from other sources so you may want to re-check with them, regarding the availability of that test.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Why does the FDA prefer handling questions about specific comparator tests in a private Pre-Submission process instead of in public forums?
VERBATIM ANSWER: And one of the reasons that we hesitate to confirm specific manufacturers or test developers for a comparator is we do believe that test developers have freedom to choose the comparator they wish, but we do want to have you make sure. And we're really not wanting to highlight only a subset of potential manufacturers on this call and in this public forum. So that's typically, why we want to handle that one-on-one offline, and understand what comparator you would like to use and be able to respond to you in that way. Thank you.

VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah, so that's a multifaceted-- the answer will be multifaceted, and it may depend on the design and function of your particular assay reagents. So typically, we allow manufacturers or developers to choose, with their assay, how they set that up and what instrument or instruments they choose to have that. For those developers that develop a kit that would be distributed, it's frequently important, but not always absolutely necessary-- but typically, it's thought to be highly good to develop your test on an FDA platform, that's our instrument that's made under GMP. And that is, it doesn't have to have been brought into the FDA before. It can be the first time. But if it's not made under GMP, then there are a whole host of questions and responsibilities that a test developer would have to take on if it's not made under GMP, so we do recommend basically, IVD grade instruments. www.fda.gov The important elements of a test include not just a performing, say, PCR but also the readouts in any software.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: A home collection kit and assay can be included in a single EUA request when the same developer is responsible for both and seeks authorization for them together.
VERBATIM QUESTION: When is it appropriate to include a home collection kit and assay in a single EUA request?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The home collection kit can be included as part of a single EUA request for a SARS-COV-2 molecular diagnostic test. This would be appropriate generally, when the developer-- when the same developer is responsible for both the home collection kit and the molecular diagnostic test, and they're seeking authorization at the same time for that combination, of the assay and the collection kit.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: In what situations should separate EUA requests referencing each other be submitted for a home collection kit and assay?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Separate EUA requests referencing each other should be submitted when the developers of the home collection kit and the molecular diagnostic assay are different.
VERBATIM QUESTION: In what situations should separate EUA requests referencing each other be submitted for a home collection kit and assay?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So both the home collection kit and the assay do need to be authorized prior to being offered. As discussed in the Molecular Diagnostic Home Specimen Collection Template, there are three general options for how to seek authorization for an at-home collection kit for use with an assay. The home collection kit can be included as part of a single EUA request for a SARS-COV-2 molecular diagnostic test. This would be appropriate generally, when the developer-- when the same developer is responsible for both the home collection kit and the molecular diagnostic test, and they're seeking authorization at the same time for that combination, of the assay and the collection kit. The second option is multiple EUA requests. This is generally, appropriate when the developer of the home collection kit is different from the developer of the molecular diagnostic assay. So they would submit separate multiple or separate EUA requests and reference each other. And then, lastly, you could have a supplemental EUA request to an EUA of a previously authorized molecular diagnostic test to add a home collection-- to add home collection with a specific home collection kit.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Has there already been any discussions about when the 564 EUA may come to an end?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Maybe, I can start Toby, and then if I'm missing anything or if I speak incorrectly. I mean, our first goal is to make sure that the tests remain available. So along those lines, we have published a draft guidance for a transition period for when and if a 564 for COVID would end and what that would mean for developers. www.fda.gov It's envisioned that we would give developers time to get in a submission-- a full authorization submission, and it's envisioned that in a likelihood that-- it all depends on the final guidance wording, but as long as the submission is in by the deadline and the FDA continues to review that submission and there is nothing wrong with that submission, then that test can remain on the market. So overall, the most important thing is that the tests remain available. It would be quite obvious for the FDA to take a look at how many full authorizations, de novos granted, or tests cleared have been finalized and authorized by the FDA as a factor involved here. So we are continuing to encourage developers to come in as soon as possible with their full submissions if they wish to remain on the market for the long-term, which I do believe is a very important thing to do. Thanks, Tim. I would just add that the draft guidance does lay out that we are contemplating and expecting a 180-day advanced notice for when the 564 will be terminated.
