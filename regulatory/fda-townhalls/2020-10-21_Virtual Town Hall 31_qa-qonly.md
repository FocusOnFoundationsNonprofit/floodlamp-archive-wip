#### 2. Addressing NIH Validation Errors and Sponsor Concerns

QA Block 2-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What steps does the FDA take to address concerns about the NIH's mishandling of assays during validation?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA has procedures to ensure package inserts and correct sample types are used during validation while addressing concerns about non-ideal sample types or overlooked aspects. Sponsors can discuss results and concerns directly with the FDA or through email for resolution.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What steps does the FDA take to address concerns about the NIH's mishandling of assays during validation?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. Well first of all, the NCI is doing a fantastic job and such an important job. And we have processes and procedures in place to try to ensure that in all cases package inserts are followed and that the correct sample types are used. We don't have the luxury of getting a wide variety of panels for each different kind of sample type as far as serum or plasma and then as far as the plasma for the anticoagulant that's used. And so we are somewhat beholden to the panel as it gets formulated and therefore, we do want to look to those situations where, you know, a non-ideal sample type was used. We typically can look to ADAS, look at as subset of the result that match and line up with the IFU for the product. If that is missed we - when we get the results we do reach out to sponsors with their NCI results. And that is an opportunity for sponsors to engage in a conversation with the FDA to address those specific questions. And a few times it has come to my attention of this and we've done our best to address those concerns. So that's an opportunity for sponsors when we give you that feedback, on the results. The panel does use serum and plasma and it does -for plasma it does use, you know, the common anticoagulants, you know, in general. So, you know, and there may be some tests that have limitations on serum versus plasma and vice versa and for plasma, the type of anticoagulation. So we appreciate working with sponsors to help us if we overlook something either at the NCI or at the FDA. And we'll do our best to properly address that situation. So if you feel that's not the case you can always reach out to Toby and me through the Templates email address for a specific discussion and a specific situation.

#### 4. FDA Review Priorities: High Throughput Tests Over LDTs

QA Block 4-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Could you provide more details about the FDA's announcement that it is declining to review LDTs?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is declining to review LDTs primarily because, under an HHS statement, they cannot require EUAs for them. The FDA's focus is on applications with high public health impact, specifically high-throughput distributed kits requiring EUAs.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Could you provide more details about the FDA's announcement that it is declining to review LDTs?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So we are currently declining to review LDTs and for the reasons that we stated on our FAQ page. And that is largely because they - the FDA cannot require an EUA and - according to the HHS statement. As far as high throughput goes those are for those tests that then we choose to review due to the, you know, unprecedented number of applications. We want to focus our resources on those that do require an EUA. And so a single lab that's developed their own test and it happens to be high throughput, you know, doesn't - if that's, you know, sort of the specifications of that its' our understanding it doesn't require an EUA. And so we are focusing on high throughput situations now. Some of that's, you know, going to be, you know, kits that have incredible amounts of automation where you load samples and step away and they have a high throughput. So we talk about high throughput, you know, being a high priority. It's that sort of situation where in particular, distributed kits. So if, you know, the kit is high throughput, the instrument is high throughput and it's able to be offered in a lot of different labs, that's going to have a huge positive public health benefit and that's where our attention is going to be focused among the other high priority items and those items that do require an EUA prior to launch.

QA Block 4-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: If the intent was to provide protocols to other laboratories for a process similar to the Yale SalivaDirect protocol, would the FDA consider it not an LDT and review it?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA views the Yale SalivaDirect protocol as a distributed test rather than an LDT since it is essentially a kit with instructions, and the developers do not perform clinical testing themselves.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If the intent was to provide protocols to other laboratories for a process similar to the Yale SalivaDirect protocol, would the FDA consider it not an LDT and review it?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So without all of the information for a specific scenario it's difficult to give an absolute answer. But I can tell you that the SalivaDirect test that you're referring to is considered to be a distributed test. And not an LDT. In fact I don't believe that Yale actually has a lab that - the developers don't have a lab that they're doing clinical testing in.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA does not have a preference for heat versus radiation inactivation. Developers should test different inactivation methods to assess robustness and their impact on tests since direct antigen assays and antibodies vary and may be affected differently.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Do you have any preference for heat inactivated versus radiation inactivated antigens for maintaining functionality?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. So I don't know that I have a preference there as far as I think, you know, the way to go about this is to try a potentially different method and conditions and see if it - see how robust that is. And then see how it impacts, you know, at least the EUA authorized antigen test. But again, they're not cookie cutter. The direct antigen tests are not cookie cutter. And if they are using antibodies that are different those antibodies then in most cases, are going to see a different epitope. And that could be very - different epitopes can be variably impacted by different methods of inactivation. Likewise if you began expecting proteins, if it doesn't - if the proteins aren't processed and get the non-nucleic acid directed modifications in the same way as in human cells then there could be alterations in performance. So they're just very clearly additional challenge when you try to develop a direct antigen reference panel as compared to a reference panel for molecular that we can basically inactivate, know that we inactivate, and know that if the RNA is there and stable that we'll have uniform good results.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: For validating an antigen test with saliva, can it be compared to a PCR test with saliva?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: To validate an antigen test with saliva, it may be compared to an EUA-authorized high-sensitivity molecular method using saliva, but check with the FDA team to confirm if it is an acceptable comparator.
VERBATIM QUESTION: For validating an antigen test with saliva, can it be compared to a PCR test with saliva?
VERBATIM ANSWER: I think that's a great question. I think it's important to - whenever you're doing kind of comparative tests, so just to make sure with the FDA staff in our office that it's an okay comparator. I would say that if it's an EUA authorized high sensitivity molecular method there's good chances that you could use saliva as the comparator, molecular saliva for the antigen comparison.

So if you are particularly interested in using saliva as a comparator I would recommend reaching out to the antigen team prior to beginning that study, to discuss that. And that would be to an alteration to what's recommended. And, you know, over time our thinking can change and we try to remain open. Now that we have a lot more saliva experience the team's thoughts may have changed. I'm not going to speak for them though.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the current issues preventing the establishment of a rapid antigen test validation panel?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The challenges in establishing a rapid antigen test validation panel include the need for BSL-3 facilities to safely handle the live virus, difficulties in confirming antigen functionality after inactivation, and the complexity of ensuring performance comparable to live virus. The FDA is exploring methods such as viral inactivation, antigen expression, and protein production to address these concerns, but efforts are ongoing.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the current issues preventing the establishment of a rapid antigen test validation panel?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Not yet to my knowledge. And there have been fairly detailed discussions about what we can do in this area. One of the concerns relates to the prior conversation about the fact that this is a BSL-3 level virus and we - most folks don't have a BSL. Most developers in labs don't have a BSL-3 facility so that they can safely handle it. There are some, but most don't. And therefore, I'm just going to tell you that transparent issues that we're facing. So you can go ahead and inactivate that virus in a number of different ways. And then you want to make sure it actually still functions at the antigen level. And it's going to be challenging to, you know, provide that kind of assurance that it's going to behave just like Wild-Type, live virus. But we are looking into it or, you know, our methods of inactivation to make it safe. We are looking into how well it performs. We're also looking at potentially the opportunity to express antigen and make protein. And then obviously you get away from the need for inactivation because it's not whole virus and should be very nontoxic. So we're working on it and I'll say that we're working on it within the US government and there may be others outside the government who are working on it.

#### 8. False Positives and Confirmatory Testing in Low-Incidence Populations

QA Block 8-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: If an antigen test yields a positive result, should it always be confirmed with another test to rule out false positives?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Yes, a confirmatory test is often necessary, especially in populations with low positive rates, as both antigen and molecular tests can yield false positives.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If an antigen test yields a positive result, should it always be confirmed with another test to rule out false positives?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. Yes, no, it - this also applies to molecular tests. They're not perfect either. Developers do their best, you know, and users of those tests do their best. And, you know, in my conversations with those who are doing pure surveillance which for this pandemic, is not something under the purview of the FDA but yet we still have a lot of conversations, this is typically done on a lot of different educational campuses around the US. They oftentimes use molecular means. And in the ones that I've spoken to specifically about this, they do have false positives and they do - first of all, if they have a positive, you know, they want to move it into the CLIA lab to be able to - in some situations at least, to provide a CLIA result rather than an unregulated surveillance result which, you know, is cautioned against obviously. But they have found that they do want to do their confirmatory testing. So and particularly as I said, in a low percent positive population, you know, and I've talked to some who have rates of detection of positives that are well below .1%. So when you start to get into a positivity rate, you know, well below not even 1%, below .1%, you are absolutely going to get into territory with even extremely high specificity tests you're going to have some false positives.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the need for confirmatory testing apply to molecular tests as well as antigen tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Confirmatory testing is recommended for molecular tests as they can also yield false positives, particularly in low percent positive populations.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the need for confirmatory testing apply to molecular tests as well as antigen tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. Yes, no, it - this also applies to molecular tests. They're not perfect either. Developers do their best, you know, and users of those tests do their best. And, you know, in my conversations with those who are doing pure surveillance which for this pandemic, is not something under the purview of the FDA but yet we still have a lot of conversations, this is typically done on a lot of different educational campuses around the US. They oftentimes use molecular means. And in the ones that I've spoken to specifically about this, they do have false positives and they do - first of all, if they have a positive, you know, they want to move it into the CLIA lab to be able to - in some situations at least, to provide a CLIA result rather than an unregulated surveillance result which, you know, is cautioned against obviously. But they have found that they do want to do their confirmatory testing. So and particularly as I said, in a low percent positive population, you know, and I've talked to some who have rates of detection of positives that are well below .1%. So when you start to get into a positivity rate, you know, well below not even 1%, below .1%, you are absolutely going to get into territory with even extremely high specificity tests you're going to have some false positives.

To my knowledge in those situation, the knowledge - the situation that I'm aware of I don't know that the test - I believe the test was performing as intended. It's just that this math says that, in a low percent population you're going to have false positives. So don't - expect false positives in that situation.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: How should developers address the increased likelihood of false positives in populations with very low incidence rates?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: In low-incidence populations, developers should not assume a positive result is accurate due to increased false positives. Confirmatory testing for critical results is recommended to improve accuracy.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How should developers address the increased likelihood of false positives in populations with very low incidence rates?
VERBATIM ANSWER: What I was really urging folks to do is not to assume in low incident populations, that a positive is a true positive, just is a chance of false positives. So as your percent positive rate increases, say it increases - I mean there are some states I'm saying wow, they're over 30%. All right. Let's just say 20%. Let's say percent positive in the population is 20% and your false positive rate is 1%. It means that you're going to have 21% positive rate, 1% of that is a false positive, the rest of it is true positive. So it means that - or it was just say overall, the measured rate is 20 to make the math easier. So that, you know, 19% true positive rate, 1% false positive rate, your percent positive overall including the false positives is 20%. One out of 20 is a false positive or 5% is a false positive. But you just, you know, if you're a clinician interpreting results or you're a laboratory interpreting results, you just want to know that. What are the chances that this individual result based on the performance of the test I'm using that it's a false positive versus a true positive? And so you never get rid of the false positive issue because no test is perfect. You never get rid of the false negative problem no matter what the incidence is because every - no test is perfect. And so I'm sorry I can't give you a really cookie cutter applies in all situations answer. It's just important that if it really matters for the result, you know, it might be good to get a confirmatory test.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Should test performance reporting explicitly clarify implications for false positive versus true positive results in test interpretation?
VERBATIM ANSWER: What we do at the FDA is make sure that these tests perform at a certain level and we make public that performance information so that the users of these tests whether it be labs or it be clinicians, can make an informed decision about what does a positive result mean in this patient, in the population that I'm testing? You know, is the patient symptomatic or are they asymptomatic? You know, have they been exposed or not exposed? So this is a very complex science to properly interpret the results of tests.

#### 10. Challenges in Molecular Test Accuracy and Specificity Determination

QA Block 10-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Could you explain if a false positive could occur more frequently at higher CT values and less at lower CT values?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: False positives could occur more frequently at higher CT values, depending on the test and platform, particularly with sensitivity thresholds. Clinicians should confirm results in cases where the population has a low percentage of positive results.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Could you explain if a false positive could occur more frequently at higher CT values and less at lower CT values?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. I think that may be dependent on the test and the platform and in particular, the unintelligible chemistry because if you have, you know, a baseline that say is set such to sort of maximize sensitivity that baseline can be inadvertently in a small, in a well-performing test a small number of cases, you know, that the baseline can be crossed earlier on too and just the case based on the detection of the technology. So really my statement has to do with when you are - when you know you have a population that has a low percent positive, you know, and it's critical to properly - to know whether that patient is truly positive or not, in the - and the chance of a false positive is significant even with the test performing as intended, that's when I recommend that you take a look at confirming.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Is there any effort to provide specific sensitivity and specificity data for molecular tests in EUA documentation?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. So, you know, even in the early days when positive patient samples were not readily available, and we allowed a virus to be diluted into negative patient matrix, there was still negative patient matrix allowed. And our bar which is an EUA bar, it's not a typical FDA bar for a test, during a pandemic and this pandemic we allow as few as 30 negative patient - independent negative patient samples to be used in the validation. In the IFU it's listed as negative percent agreement. That's for technical reasons because you don't have a - not a true comparator and we call it negative percent agreement. So if you look at negative percent agreement from the very beginning, all of - to my knowledge, all of the tests authorized have a specificity determination. It however, may be on as few as 30 negative samples in which case the - in which case the confidence intervals around that result are quite large. And we do provide the confidence intervals in the instructions for use with the test. So you can look at that confidence interval as well. And that's another thing that's perhaps not well understood is okay, we're measuring the performance of these tests for this EUA and, you know, and the confidence interval is dependent in large part, on the number of samples that are tested. If only 30 are tested and you may be - you may measure 100% specificity or 100% NPA. But, you know, statistics tells us that it could be lower than that and we provide a 95% confidence interval so that you can say oh, you know, a 95% confidence interval means you can fall as low as X% on the specificity based on the small sample number that you've tested in the validation study.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA ensures that tests are authorized only by prescription to engage clinicians in correctly interpreting results. Additionally, the FDA plans to collaborate with CDC, CMS, and CLIA to enhance educational efforts on test interpretation in challenging scenarios.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What can be done to improve education among healthcare providers about interpreting test results in challenging scenarios, such as low prevalence environments?
VERBATIM ANSWER: It's why basically every test that we've authorized to date is by prescription. Why is that? Because having a clinician involved, somebody who can order the test involved, they can help interpret the results correctly. Is it a perfect system? No. But even the direct antigen tests that are being used in nursing homes across the country are still by prescription only. And so we are wanting to augment what we're saying the CDC has guidelines on this that are published on their Web site. And CMS and CLIA are supportive of this. We're going to augment what we're saying about this, to help educate the full community. And on this situation where there's a significant ratio of false positives in a population where it really matters. And there's huge disruption if there is a positive and you want to make sure it's a true positive. Okay?

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is there a way for sponsors to discuss concerns about NIH validation issues with the NIH, the FDA, or both together?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Yes, sponsors can discuss concerns about NIH validation issues with the FDA and potentially address specific situations through the Templates email address for further discussion.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is there a way for sponsors to discuss concerns about NIH validation issues with the NIH, the FDA, or both together?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. Well first of all, the NCI is doing a fantastic job and such an important job. And we have processes and procedures in place to try to ensure that in all cases package inserts are followed and that the correct sample types are used. We don't have the luxury of getting a wide variety of panels for each different kind of sample type as far as serum or plasma and then as far as the plasma for the anticoagulant that's used. And so we are somewhat beholden to the panel as it gets formulated and therefore, we do want to look to those situations where, you know, a non-ideal sample type was used. We typically can look to ADAS, look at as subset of the result that match and line up with the IFU for the product. If that is missed we - when we get the results we do reach out to sponsors with their NCI results. And that is an opportunity for sponsors to engage in a conversation with the FDA to address those specific questions. And a few times it has come to my attention of this and we've done our best to address those concerns. So that's an opportunity for sponsors when we give you that feedback, on the results. The panel does use serum and plasma and it does -for plasma it does use, you know, the common anticoagulants, you know, in general. So, you know, and there may be some tests that have limitations on serum versus plasma and vice versa and for plasma, the type of anticoagulation. So we appreciate working with sponsors to help us if we overlook something either at the NCI or at the FDA. And we'll do our best to properly address that situation. So if you feel that's not the case you can always reach out to Toby and me through the Templates email address for a specific discussion and a specific situation.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Do you know if the FDA has a certificate of inactivation for the SARS-CoV-2 FDA panel?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA has processes to ensure the SARS-CoV-2 panel is inactivated and safe to distribute at a BSL-2 level. However, they are unsure if they can provide a certificate of inactivation but might offer an alternative, such as a letter.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Do you know if the FDA has a certificate of inactivation for the SARS-CoV-2 FDA panel?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Toby may know. You know, this - we have processes and procedures within the FDA. We received live virus, we grew it up with - on the FDA campus in a BSL-3 facility. We followed a protocol, an institutional protocol that was reviewed by the FDA to make sure that it was safe for our employees and I think we did the same for the inactivation. What I don't know is - and so we have complete confidence that it is safe to distribute as a BSL-2 level panel. But what I don't know is if we have the ability to provide such a certificate. And there may be an opportunity to write a letter rather than say provide a certificate.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is there a panel for an antigen test validation for a rapid antigen test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: There is no panel yet for antigen test validation for a rapid antigen test. The FDA is exploring approaches, including inactivation methods or using expressed antigens, but challenges remain due to virus handling risks.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is there a panel for an antigen test validation for a rapid antigen test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Not yet to my knowledge. And there have been fairly detailed discussions about what we can do in this area. One of the concerns relates to the prior conversation about the fact that this is a BSL-3 level virus and we - most folks don't have a BSL. Most developers in labs don't have a BSL-3 facility so that they can safely handle it. There are some, but most don't. And therefore, I'm just going to tell you that transparent issues that we're facing. So you can go ahead and inactivate that virus in a number of different ways. And then you want to make sure it actually still functions at the antigen level. And it's going to be challenging to, you know, provide that kind of assurance that it's going to behave just like Wild-Type, live virus. But we are looking into it or, you know, our methods of inactivation to make it safe. We are looking into how well it performs. We're also looking at potentially the opportunity to express antigen and make protein. And then obviously you get away from the need for inactivation because it's not whole virus and should be very nontoxic. So we're working on it and I'll say that we're working on it within the US government and there may be others outside the government who are working on it. We're just not ready to move forward but we certainly are very interested. So thank you for your question.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What challenges are faced in developing reference panels specific to direct antigen tests compared to molecular tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Developing reference panels for direct antigen tests poses challenges like varying antibody interactions with epitopes, effects of virus inactivation methods, and differences in how proteins are processed compared to molecular reference panels.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What challenges are faced in developing reference panels specific to direct antigen tests compared to molecular tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: But again, they're not cookie cutter. The direct antigen tests are not cookie cutter. And if they are using antibodies that are different those antibodies then in most cases, are going to see a different epitope. And that could be very - different epitopes can be variably impacted by different methods of inactivation. Likewise if you began expecting proteins, if it doesn't - if the proteins aren't processed and get the non-nucleic acid directed modifications in the same way as in human cells then there could be alterations in performance. So they're just very clearly additional challenge when you try to develop a direct antigen reference panel as compared to a reference panel for molecular that we can basically inactivate, know that we inactivate, and know that if the RNA is there and stable that we'll have uniform good results.

REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 6-11
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Why might antibodies with varying epitopes react differently to inactivation methods?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Antibodies with different epitopes may react differently to inactivation methods because they are not uniform, and epitopes can be variably impacted depending on the inactivation process used.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Why might antibodies with varying epitopes react differently to inactivation methods?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. So I don't know that I have a preference there as far as I think, you know, the way to go about this is to try a potentially different method and conditions and see if it - see how robust that is. And then see how it impacts, you know, at least the EUA authorized antigen test. But again, they're not cookie cutter. The direct antigen tests are not cookie cutter. And if they are using antibodies that are different those antibodies then in most cases, are going to see a different epitope. And that could be very - different epitopes can be variably impacted by different methods of inactivation. Likewise if you began expecting proteins, if it doesn't - if the proteins aren't processed and get the non-nucleic acid directed modifications in the same way as in human cells then there could be alterations in performance.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: How should developers confirm that a proposed comparator method complies with the FDA's expectations for antigen test validation?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Developers should confirm with the FDA staff to ensure the comparator method is acceptable for antigen test validation. Generally, EUA-authorized high-sensitivity molecular methods are likely acceptable, but it is best to verify directly with the FDA team.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How should developers confirm that a proposed comparator method complies with the FDA's expectations for antigen test validation?
VERBATIM ANSWER: I think that's a great question. I think it's important to - whenever you're doing kind of comparative tests, so just to make sure with the FDA staff in our office that it's an okay comparator. I would say that if it's an EUA authorized high sensitivity molecular method there's good chances that you could use saliva as the comparator, molecular saliva for the antigen comparison. But I would say it can depend and just double check with our team.

QA Block 6-14
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What steps should a developer take to request the use of saliva as a comparator sample for antigen test validation despite current template recommendations?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA suggests reaching out to the antigen team to discuss and request approval prior to using saliva as a comparator in an antigen test validation study since the current template advises against it.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What steps should a developer take to request the use of saliva as a comparator sample for antigen test validation despite current template recommendations?
VERBATIM ANSWER: I don't have it up in front of me right now, but I believe the antigen template discusses appropriate comparators and specifically mentions no saliva. So if you are particularly interested in using saliva as a comparator I would recommend reaching out to the antigen team prior to beginning that study, to discuss that.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Has the FDA's position on the use of saliva for antigen comparators evolved with recent data?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA's position on using saliva for antigen comparators may change over time as more data and experience with saliva are gained. Developers should consult with the FDA team for updates.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Has the FDA's position on the use of saliva for antigen comparators evolved with recent data?
VERBATIM ANSWER: And that would be to an alteration to what's recommended. And, you know, over time our thinking can change and we try to remain open. Now that we have a lot more saliva experience the team's thoughts may have changed. I'm not going to speak for them though.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Should molecular tests include disclaimers or guidance similar to those recommended for serology tests in specific situations?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is updating FAQ guidance and may include disclaimers for molecular tests in specific contexts, especially for asymptomatic claims. This is situational and depends on population positivity rates and test circumstances.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Should molecular tests include disclaimers or guidance similar to those recommended for serology tests in specific situations?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We are looking at - Toby's working on an FAQ update as we speak. In fact I think she has sent me language to review and I haven't done it yet. You sent me language yesterday and I forget when. So we're going to try to further explain this. And we may look at additional information in the intended use statement, especially when let's say asymptomatic claims are made about a test. So it really is situational. It depends. It depends. So what we saw is that - recently, is nursing homes - we're seeing a lot of positives. When we went and tried to confirm it roughly they were only able to confirm about half of those positives. And they were shocked. They were frightened that the test wasn't performing. What I'm saying is the test performed. To my knowledge in those situation, the knowledge - the situation that I'm aware of I don't know that the test - I believe the test was performing as intended. It's just that this math says that, in a low percent population you're going to have false positives. So don't - expect false positives in that situation. And therefore, if it's really important to know whether that patient is positive or negative get a confirmatory test.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are researchers allowed to purchase non-EUA COVID-19 diagnostic kits for their research?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Researchers can purchase non-EUA COVID-19 diagnostic kits for research purposes only, but these kits must not be used in clinical laboratories for clinical use. The FDA guidance document provides details on proper labeling for RUO kits.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are researchers allowed to purchase non-EUA COVID-19 diagnostic kits for their research?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, sure. So if it is truly a research lab doing research, then absolutely they can use research kits, research tests, research components. What we don't want to see is kits that are labeled for RUO being sold to a clinical laboratory for clinical use. And we have discussed previously the guidance document that we have that talks about appropriate labeling for RUO and that is a really good resource to take a look at how we've laid out what is appropriate for an RUO labeled device versus a device that should be IVD labeled.
