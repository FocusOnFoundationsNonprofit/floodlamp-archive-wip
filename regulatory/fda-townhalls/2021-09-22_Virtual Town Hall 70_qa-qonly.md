QA Block 4-5
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can the same set of samples be used to support claims for both total and neutralizing antibodies in a multi-indication test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The same set of samples may not support claims for both total and neutralizing antibodies simultaneously, and additional samples may be needed to validate multiple indications.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can the same set of samples be used to support claims for both total and neutralizing antibodies in a multi-indication test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Since the validation and considerations for neutralizing antibody tests are different from binding antibody tests, the same samples may not be able to support all proposed claims simultaneously, and additional samples may be appropriate to validate multiple indications.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Validation requirements, Neutralizing vs. total antibodies, Sample use limitations
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 8-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How long does it take for the FDA to respond to questions submitted through the CDRH EUA Templates email address?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: If FDA has not responded to an inquiry via the CDRH EUA Templates email address within a couple of weeks, users are advised to send a follow-up email.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How long does it take for the FDA to respond to questions submitted through the CDRH EUA Templates email address?

SPEAKER QUESTION: Julio Herrera
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: response time, CDRH EUA Templates email, FDA correspondence
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 9-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is it quicker to submit a pre-EUA and then an EUA, or to submit the EUA directly for the application?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA generally recommends submitting an EUA directly for routine assay tests as it saves time and is low-risk when following FDA templates.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is it quicker to submit a pre-EUA and then an EUA, or to submit the EUA directly for the application?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah, so for most EUA submissions today for routine sort of assay tests, we've got templates for all recommendations for all the studies. And there are lots of authorizations for all these common types of tests. So I really don't believe there's any need for pre-EUA and would not recommend that pre-EUAs be used in those circumstances, but that you go right ahead and do your EUA. And that will save a lot of time. There is some risks, as always. But if you're doing exactly what others have done in the same manner, and according to our template, the risks are very, very small.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Tianyang Liu
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: EUA submission process, Pre-EUA vs EUA
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 9-7
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the FDA prioritize reviewing EUAs over pre-EUAs when there is a backlog of submissions?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA prioritizes reviewing EUAs over pre-EUAs, particularly in cases where the EUA submissions follow standard recommendations and templates. Pre-EUAs are best used for novel or non-standard cases.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA prioritize reviewing EUAs over pre-EUAs when there is a backlog of submissions?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So, we are still receiving so many applications and still have a backlog. And we're trying to get through everything. And again, it's why I don't recommend a pre-EUA if you're just fine with standard recommendations that the FDA makes for standard devices. People should reserve the pre-EUA for something novel, something new, something that we haven't discussed on this town hall, something that isn't in the templates, something there isn't a template for. That's where you get the most bang for the buck on the pre-EUA. We do make some recommendations about pre-EUA. But that's not global and it's very specific and is trying to manage the workflow that we have. So we have a lot of EUAs in house. And when we have an EUA in house, where perhaps all the studies were done and the tests can be authorized, it seems a little bit more important for us to review that than a pre-EUA for something that's very standard. But we're trying to get to all the work. It's just a lot of work.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: EUA review prioritization, backlog management, pre-EUA vs EUA
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 11-8
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is there potential for the US government to fund similar large-scale validation projects for antigen tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA considers a government-funded validation program for antigen tests as an interesting and valuable idea, highlighting the success of a similar serology program. However, it would require significant funding and collaboration, and FDA will take the idea back for discussion.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is there potential for the US government to fund similar large-scale validation projects for antigen tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Your idea of a US government stood-up program to evaluate antigen tests is an interesting one. Of course, the FDA and NCI and CDC stood up a program for the serology test developers. And I forget the latest number on serology tests, but we authorized almost 90, if not over 90 serology tests, many of them lateral flow devices very similar to antigen tests through that program. And it's an interesting idea, and very willing to take that back. That program at the NCI was funded. And it took a lot of money to do that program. I don't know if the budget numbers are public. But I know the amount and it was not insignificant. And obviously, I would be very supportive of something like that, because an independent assessment by the US government is quite valuable. And as we found out with the serology test, and I think I've mentioned this multiple times before on this call, those tests that were submitted to NCI and were cleared by the FDA to be tested at NCI, we did an initial review of all submissions only recommended to NCI those tests that after our initial review seemed important to test. So we did eliminate from the list before NCI tested, and still something like 60% to 70% of the tests that had passed that first FDA review failed at NCI. And so this kind of program can be very helpful for challenging questions. And I think it's a really good idea and definitely will take that back.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Franco Calderon
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: antigen test validation, government funding, program feasibility

#### 2. FDA Guidance on Swabs and Serial Testing Validation

QA Block 2-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Do self-collection swabs for a home-use novel amplified signal lateral flow device need to be FDA EUA authorized, or can any FDA-cleared swab be used, provided they are validated and part of usability and clinical studies?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends nasal swabs for home use. Mid-turbinate swabs may also be used if safe, especially for children. NP and OP swabs are not recommended. FDA allows FDA-cleared swabs (510k) to be used, provided they are validated and included in usability and clinical studies.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Do self-collection swabs for a home-use novel amplified signal lateral flow device need to be FDA EUA authorized, or can any FDA-cleared swab be used, provided they are validated and part of usability and clinical studies?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So the FDA does recommend nasal swabs for home use. Mid-turbinate swabs may be used if safe, especially for children. Typically, for children, in particular there'll be some method to prevent the swab from going up too far. NP and OP swabs are not recommended. Now, one second. So, bottom line is that swabs can be used that are FDA 510k cleared, as long as they're validated and part of the clinical and usability studies.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Self-collection swabs, Home diagnostic devices, FDA EUA and 510k clearance
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 2-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is it possible to get further clarification on what the FDA defines as consecutively-collected samples in relation to pooling guidance for molecular and antigen diagnostic tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Consecutively collected samples refer to all samples from eligible and unique study subjects collected during the study period. No eligible samples should be omitted without a reasonable explanation. FDA advises consulting on the design of complex serial testing studies to minimize burden.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is it possible to get further clarification on what the FDA defines as consecutively-collected samples in relation to pooling guidance for molecular and antigen diagnostic tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So, consecutively collected samples are all the samples that are collected from eligible and unique study subjects between the start and end date of the study. During the study, no samples from eligible subjects should be omitted from the analysis. So, in other words, pick a time period from if you're using any method of having those samples. We don't want to have subjects drop out, unless there's an explanation and a reasonable explanation for it. If you were designing a serial testing validation study, we recommend reaching out through a pre-EUA, or to your lead reviewer, to discuss details. This kind of serial testing validation study is rather complex and should only be implemented with input from the FDA to avoid unnecessary burden.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Pooling guidance, Consecutively-collected samples, Study design
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 2-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: For consecutively-collected samples, does it mean the same person must return to the collection site for multiple visits to collect new swabs?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Consecutively collected samples refer to all samples collected from unique, eligible study subjects during the study period. Subjects are not required to return for multiple visits unless specified, as all samples must be included in the analysis unless an omission is justified.
VERBATIM QUESTION: For consecutively-collected samples, does it mean the same person must return to the collection site for multiple visits to collect new swabs?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So, consecutively collected samples are all the samples that are collected from eligible and unique study subjects between the start and end date of the study. During the study, no samples from eligible subjects should be omitted from the analysis. So, in other words, pick a time period from if you're using any method of having those samples. We don't want to have subjects drop out, unless there's an explanation and a reasonable explanation for it.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: consecutively-collected samples, study design, sample analysis
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 2-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: For consecutively-collected samples, does it mean only the initial sample should be tested in a consecutive manner?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Consecutively collected samples include all samples collected from eligible and unique study subjects during the study period, and none should be excluded without a valid reason. Testing should follow a defined time period and involve consultation with the FDA for complex designs.
VERBATIM QUESTION: For consecutively-collected samples, does it mean only the initial sample should be tested in a consecutive manner?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So, consecutively collected samples are all the samples that are collected from eligible and unique study subjects between the start and end date of the study. During the study, no samples from eligible subjects should be omitted from the analysis. So, in other words, pick a time period from if you're using any method of having those samples. We don't want to have subjects drop out, unless there's an explanation and a reasonable explanation for it. If you were designing a serial testing validation study, we recommend reaching out through a pre-EUA, or to your lead reviewer, to discuss details. This kind of serial testing validation study is rather complex and should only be implemented with input from the FDA to avoid unnecessary burden.

#### 4. EUA Validation Guidance for Dual Antibody Tests

QA Block 4-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Which EUA template does the FDA recommend using for a test that detects both total and neutralizing antibodies simultaneously?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends using the total antibody template for total antibodies and the neutralizing antibody template for neutralizing antibodies. If neither template fully captures your test, combine applicable sections from both in a single EUA request, as different validations apply. Additional samples may be required for multiple claims, and detailed questions can be submitted through a pre-EUA.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Which EUA template does the FDA recommend using for a test that detects both total and neutralizing antibodies simultaneously?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So I mean, this is a good question. And the requirements of validation for both the recommendations that we make are different for both. So the FDA does recommend that developers complete all portions of a template that are relevant to their test. So for the total antibody, follow the templates for recommendations for total antibody. For neutralizing, follow the neutralizing antibody template. If there are validation recommends that are not covered in a single template but apply to your test, we recommend you provide the applicable sections from each template in a single EUA request. Since the validation and considerations for neutralizing antibody tests are different from binding antibody tests, the same samples may not be able to support all proposed claims simultaneously, and additional samples may be appropriate to validate multiple indications.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: If we want to implement changes to our devices and test kits, do we need to complete our current original study design, prospectively collecting 30 positives and 30 negatives, before starting a new trial with the updated device designs?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA expects you to complete your commitments for the currently authorized device before making changes, as these commitments are tied to its authorization. It may be possible to test both the current and new devices in a combined study but ensure an unbiased approach approved by the FDA reviewer.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If we want to implement changes to our devices and test kits, do we need to complete our current original study design, prospectively collecting 30 positives and 30 negatives, before starting a new trial with the updated device designs?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So any commitments made for that device are important to complete. And that's because patients have been tested with that device. And the condition of authorization for that was prescribed. And if there were to be any issues with the device, as it was for your first EUA submission, we would want to know that. So that's a commitment that your firm made at the time of authorization. And we do expect you to complete that commitment. You may be able, through an innovative study design, test both devices at the same time. But not to have any bias, I suggest you run that study, the combined study design, through our FDA review staff, your reviewer, perhaps, that was used for the initial device, to get their input before starting, just to make sure you're doing this in an unbiased manner.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Would it be possible to start this new study design at the same study site, or do we need to look for a new study site to conduct this repeat validation study?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The same sites could be used, and they could be used. You could begin the new study after you finish the first, but maybe a little bit cleaner, easier for the study site to understand and not get confused. But again, if you were to want to do this, finish the commitment for the original device and start validation for the same device at the same time, maybe even on the same patients. There's no prohibition against doing that. We would just want to make sure that you're doing in a manner that is unbiased towards the new devices. And obviously, you might get three swabs. I don't know the details of your procedure, whether it's a direct swab or goes into some sort of buffer and if the buffer is the same between the two devices. If you use a buffer first and the buffer is the same between the two devices, then you want the tests done in a manner in which the person performing the test doesn't know the result for the other sample. So I mean, if they start the process for both at the same time before any one results out, then you could eliminate on this bias.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: If a buffer is used and is the same between devices, tests should be conducted so the person performing the test does not know the result of the other sample to avoid bias. FDA recommends discussing specifics with your reviewer.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are there specific procedures for using buffers common to multiple devices in order to ensure unbiased results?
VERBATIM ANSWER: If you use a buffer first and the buffer is the same between the two devices, then you want the tests done in a manner in which the person performing the test doesn't know the result for the other sample. So I mean, if they start the process for both at the same time before any one results out, then you could eliminate on this bias. But these are the details that are best had in discussion with your reviewer.

SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: buffers for unbiased testing, clinical test design
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 6-7
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What precautions should be taken when testing multiple samples from the same patient to prevent bias?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Testing should be done in a way that eliminates bias, such as ensuring the tester is unaware of the results of other samples and conducting tests simultaneously. Consult the FDA reviewer for study-specific details.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What precautions should be taken when testing multiple samples from the same patient to prevent bias?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We would just want to make sure that you're doing in a manner that is unbiased towards the new devices. And obviously, you might get three swabs. I don't know the details of your procedure, whether it's a direct swab or goes into some sort of buffer and if the buffer is the same between the two devices. If you use a buffer first and the buffer is the same between the two devices, then you want the tests done in a manner in which the person performing the test doesn't know the result for the other sample. So I mean, if they start the process for both at the same time before any one results out, then you could eliminate on this bias.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: How should developers proceed in validating changes to a device while fulfilling original EUA commitments?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Developers must fulfill original EUA commitments as these are tied to patient safety and device authorization. They may validate changes by conducting concurrent studies for both the original and updated devices, ensuring the process is unbiased. FDA recommends consulting their review staff for guidance.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How should developers proceed in validating changes to a device while fulfilling original EUA commitments?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So any commitments made for that device are important to complete. And that's because patients have been tested with that device. And the condition of authorization for that was prescribed. And if there were to be any issues with the device, as it was for your first EUA submission, we would want to know that. So that's a commitment that your firm made at the time of authorization. And we do expect you to complete that commitment. You may be able, through an innovative study design, test both devices at the same time. But not to have any bias, I suggest you run that study, the combined study design, through our FDA review staff, your reviewer, perhaps, that was used for the initial device, to get their input before starting, just to make sure you're doing this in an unbiased manner.

#### 7. Prescription vs OTC Multi-Analyte Tests: Key Considerations

QA Block 7-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can you clarify where and how healthcare providers would be involved with multi-analyte panel tests, such as whether they are just writing a prescription for the test or also being involved during result interpretation?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Healthcare providers are involved by writing the prescription for multi-analyte tests. Patients are encouraged to report results to clinicians and discuss them. Provider-patient interaction is recommended to help with result interpretation.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can you clarify where and how healthcare providers would be involved with multi-analyte panel tests, such as whether they are just writing a prescription for the test or also being involved during result interpretation?
VERBATIM ANSWER: You can look at the home prescription tests that we've already authorized. There's still some on the FDA website. You can look at all the labeling, the IFU, the instructions, what we recommend. So it starts with a prescription written by the health care provider. And then the patient can get the test. And that may even be something that is done well before a patient has any symptoms or any need to test so that they have the test on hand. When they complete the testing, then they're encouraged to report those results to their clinician and discuss those results with them. That's the additional mitigation that we're asking for in that situation. But again, I think we still have a couple that haven't moved to OTC in the home and that are prescription pills, so you can see the labeling and the interaction between patient and clinician that we recommend.

QA Block 7-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: If a robust usability study demonstrates high user comprehension for flu and SARS-CoV-2 test results, could that reopen discussions about OTC authorization instead of prescription-only use?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA is open-minded but has concerns about OTC use for asymptomatic flu or RSV testing due to unclear implications of results. EUA authorizations primarily cover SARS-CoV-2, with flexibility for symptomatic cases of other analytes, but asymptomatic cases require physician involvement.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If a robust usability study demonstrates high user comprehension for flu and SARS-CoV-2 test results, could that reopen discussions about OTC authorization instead of prescription-only use?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Well, we always remain open-minded. But our concerns go to testing somebody who's asymptomatic for flu or RSV. We just don't know what that means in those two populations and what they should do with that information. And so there could be false positives, could be true positives. And we just don't understand in an asymptomatic population, in particular, when we give an OTC authorization, it's typically a situation to use that for screening for SARS-CoV-2 given that there's so many asymptomatic positives out there. And so the EUA authorities cover SARS. They don't necessarily cover any other analytes. We made some flexibility here to allow other analytes because they're certainly in the differential diagnosis if you have symptoms. But they wouldn't necessarily be in the differential diagnosis if you didn't have symptoms. And so if a patient is asymptomatic and gets a positive for flu or RSV, we want them to have a physician or clinician contact to try to understand what that means and know what to do with that.

REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 7-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: When you say 'physician contact,' does it mean that the result has to go through a healthcare provider before release, or is it just encouraged that an HCP is available to assist upon receiving results?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA clarifies that physician contact may depend on the test type. For home collection devices, a physician may review results before release, whereas in home tests, patients see their results first. FDA emphasizes the importance of patient access to healthcare professionals for understanding results.
VERBATIM QUESTION: When you say 'physician contact,' does it mean that the result has to go through a healthcare provider before release, or is it just encouraged that an HCP is available to assist upon receiving results?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So it depends. I mean, there's home collection devices that physicians may want to look at the results before they release it to the patient. If it's a home test situation, the patients are going to see their results there before the physician or clinician does. And so we want to have there be a relationship between the patient and their health care provider established so that we know that that patient has access to a health care professional to help understand the results.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Which submission approach do you recommend: submitting a pre-EUA first or submitting the EUA directly?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah, so for most EUA submissions today for routine sort of assay tests, we've got templates for all recommendations for all the studies. And there are lots of authorizations for all these common types of tests. So I really don't believe there's any need for pre-EUA and would not recommend that pre-EUAs be used in those circumstances, but that you go right ahead and do your EUA.

VERBATIM QUESTION: If a submission protocol is really good, could it take longer for the FDA team to respond initially but proceed quickly after receiving official feedback?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So, we are still receiving so many applications and still have a backlog. And we're trying to get through everything. And again, it's why I don't recommend a pre-EUA if you're just fine with standard recommendations that the FDA makes for standard devices. People should reserve the pre- EUA for something novel, something new, something that we haven't discussed on this town hall, something that isn't in the templates, something there isn't a template for. That's where you get the most bang for the buck on the pre-EUA. We do make some recommendations about pre-EUA. But that's not global and it's very specific and is trying to manage the workflow that we have. So we have a lot of EUAs in house. And when we have an EUA in house, where perhaps all the studies were done and the tests can be authorized, it seems a little bit more important for us to review that than a pre-EUA for something that's very standard.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA require any additional data for saliva-based diagnostics to ensure accuracy across different respiratory viruses?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Saliva is an option that we provided. It's a very unique option in the world of respiratory viruses. Saliva-- we don't know, to say the performance of other virus detection-- flu, RSV. We've gotten questions about panels from saliva. And we just don't know if those viruses will work. We're open to seeing data. But I've also seen data that suggests that the viral contents in some saliva patients can be much lower than a nasal swab or a nasopharyngeal swab.

#### 11. Challenges and Proposals for Rapid Test Validation Programs

QA Block 11-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Do you see FDA, CDC, NIH, or any organization taking a more active role in helping test developers with the validation of tests, similar to programs in countries like the UK or Germany?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA prioritizes antigen tests and quickly processes applications. A government program to validate antigen tests, similar to the serology test program, is an interesting idea and may be valuable. FDA supports the concept and will consider taking the idea back.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Do you see FDA, CDC, NIH, or any organization taking a more active role in helping test developers with the validation of tests, similar to programs in countries like the UK or Germany?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So thank you for your question. As I stated at the top of the call, antigen tests, very specifically I mentioned, if you were on the call at that time, continuing to be a top priority. And the FDA is doing its part to get through all the applications as quickly as possible and give feedback to submitters as quickly as possible. Your idea of a US government stood-up program to evaluate antigen tests is an interesting one. Of course, the FDA and NCI and CDC stood up a program for the serology test developers. And I forget the latest number on serology tests, but we authorized almost 90, if not over 90 serology tests, many of them lateral flow devices very similar to antigen tests through that program. And it's an interesting idea, and very willing to take that back. That program at the NCI was funded. And it took a lot of money to do that program. I don't know if the budget numbers are public. But I know the amount and it was not insignificant. And obviously, I would be very supportive of something like that, because an independent assessment by the US government is quite valuable. And as we found out with the serology test, and I think I've mentioned this multiple times before on this call, those tests that were submitted to NCI and were cleared by the FDA to be tested at NCI, we did an initial review of all submissions only recommended to NCI those tests that after our initial review seemed important to test. So we did eliminate from the list before NCI tested, and still something like 60% to 70% of the tests that had passed that first FDA review failed at NCI. And so this kind of program can be very helpful for challenging questions. And I think it's a really good idea and definitely will take that back.

#### 13. Guidance for Antigen Test Validation and Submission Challenges

QA Block 13-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What do you recommend as a way or path forward for submission in the absence of feedback from FDA for validating multiplex devices, especially with a lack of prospective samples for influenza?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends resubmitting the pre-EUA to the Templates email and asking for specifics via Toby. Due to the lack of flu samples, developers should validate SARS-only targets initially and disable results for insufficiently validated analytes, reactivating them once validation data is available.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What do you recommend as a way or path forward for submission in the absence of feedback from FDA for validating multiplex devices, especially with a lack of prospective samples for influenza?
VERBATIM ANSWER: If that's been more than a couple of weeks since you submitted your pre-EUA, please send it back to the Templates email and ask please ask for Toby to get connected to find out if we can give you even more specifics about your submission. But this is a challenge. So particularly with antigen devices, bank samples can be challenging if they're not banked direct swabs. And people just don't typically bank direct swabs. And so we've seen so many issues with antigen tests. And we've removed VTM from a number of antigen test authorizations for this pandemic because of the issues we've seen with VTM. VTM can raise the baseline, artificially increase the sensitivity of device, and then raise the false positive rate. So that we're really not pleased with VTM. So this is a really, really challenging question, because we have so many already fully authorized flu point-of-care and central molecular tests for flu. And the flu is not the pandemic virus-- the pandemic virus that gives us authorities, some of the EUA processes for SARS-CoV-2, COVID. But we've tried to be as flexible as possible and stretch those authorities as far as possible and to help out here. The good thing is there's not any flu now and there may not be any flu this season. So that the other thing that we've consistently messaged is, if you're not able to get validation done for the non-SARS targets on your device due to the fact that you can't get appropriate bank samples, and you can't get those positives prospectively that are fresh, look at how you can somehow turn off the results for those other analytes that you don't have enough positives to get an authorization for. And sometimes that's more challenging, say, for a non-instrumented- or non-smartphone-read rapid antigen test because it's a visual read. And your top cassette may say flu A for the SARS on it, but we'll be imaginative and creative in what you can do in that situation. For example, if the window is too big for SARS because the home user might or the point-of-care user might see the flu bands and get confused, then they can make that window smaller. You may be able to remove identifiers from those extra bands if people will not be confused by those extra bands. If it's a smartphone reader or instrumented device, you can simply turn off the reporting from those bands until those are authorized. So you can get an initial authorization for SARS only. And then once you accumulate enough data and can submit the additional data for the additional targets, those things can be turned on, physically or electronically, whatever is the possible way. So that's what we've done for prior devices prior to the pandemic. And BioFire is a great example where they have this huge panel of respiratory viruses and sometimes other panels. And they may or may not get enough data for the less common targets. But they go ahead and get authorization for what they can get at the time, and then they update their submission and expand their authorization. So trying to be as flexible as possible. At the end of the day, we need to know if these flu or other non- SARS targets actually work so that patients are getting accurate information.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA discourages the use of VTM due to its issues in antigen test validation. If banked direct swabs or fresh positives are unavailable, developers can disable reporting for non-SARS targets, adjust windows for clarity, or remove extra band identifiers. SARS-only authorization can be pursued, with expanded authorization possible later upon submitting additional data.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the acceptable alternatives to banked direct swabs for antigen test validation?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So particularly with antigen devices, bank samples can be challenging if they're not banked direct swabs. And people just don't typically bank direct swabs.

For visual read devices, reduce confusion by modifying the display, such as resizing or removing irrelevant bands or identifiers, until sufficient validation data for flu or other targets can be obtained and additional authorizations can follow.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How can antigen test manufacturers address challenges with visual read devices that include multiple analytes, such as flu and SARS?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So particularly with antigen devices, bank samples can be challenging if they're not banked direct swabs. And people just don't typically bank direct swabs. And so we've seen so many issues with antigen tests. And we've removed VTM from a number of antigen test authorizations for this pandemic because of the issues we've seen with VTM. VTM can raise the baseline, artificially increase the sensitivity of device, and then raise the false positive rate. So that we're really not pleased with VTM. So this is a really, really challenging question, because we have so many already fully authorized flu point-of-care and central molecular tests for flu. And the flu is not the pandemic virus-- the pandemic virus that gives us authorities, some of the EUA processes for SARS-CoV-2, COVID. But we've tried to be as flexible as possible and stretch those authorities as far as possible and to help out here. The good thing is there's not any flu now and there may not be any flu this season. So that the other thing that we've consistently messaged is, if you're not able to get validation done for the non-SARS targets on your device due to the fact that you can't get appropriate bank samples, and you can't get those positives prospectively that are fresh, look at how you can somehow turn off the results for those other analytes that you don't have enough positives to get an authorization for. And sometimes that's more challenging, say, for a non-instrumented- or non-smartphone-read rapid antigen test because it's a visual read. And your top cassette may say flu A for the SARS on it, but we'll be imaginative and creative in what you can do in that situation. For example, if the window is too big for SARS because the home user might or the point-of-care user might see the flu bands and get confused, then they can make that window smaller. You may be able to remove identifiers from those extra bands if people will not be confused by those extra bands. If it's a smartphone reader or instrumented device, you can simply turn off the reporting from those bands until those are authorized. So you can get an initial authorization for SARS only. And then once you accumulate enough data and can submit the additional data for the additional targets, those things can be turned on, physically or electronically, whatever is the possible way. So that's what we've done for prior devices prior to the pandemic.

QA Block 13-9
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What should developers do if there are no flu cases to validate influenza targets for multiplex devices?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: If flu cases aren't available for validation, developers should consider turning off the influenza reporting functionality in their devices temporarily and seek authorization for SARS only. Validation and reporting for flu can be added later when data becomes available.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can additional targets on a multiplex device be turned off to allow for partial authorization for only SARS-CoV-2?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: For smartphone or instrumented devices, additional targets on a multiplex device can have their reporting turned off to achieve initial authorization for SARS-CoV-2. Once sufficient data is collected for the other targets, they can be reactivated.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What steps are needed to re-enable other analytes on a multiplex test once sufficient data is available for validation and authorization?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Developers can initially disable analytes not yet validated and approved, then later submit additional data for those analytes to enable them once authorized. Methods may be physical or electronic, depending on the device.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What steps are needed to re-enable other analytes on a multiplex test once sufficient data is available for validation and authorization?

And then once you accumulate enough data and can submit the additional data for the additional targets, those things can be turned on, physically or electronically, whatever is the possible way. So that's what we've done for prior devices prior to the pandemic. And BioFire is a great example where they have this huge panel of respiratory viruses and sometimes other panels. And they may or may not get enough data for the less common targets. But they go ahead and get authorization for what they can get at the time, and then they update their submission and expand their authorization.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are there specific considerations for modifying test designs to prevent user confusion when testing for multiple analytes?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: If validation for non-SARS targets isn't possible, FDA suggests turning off results for unanalyzed targets. For visual-read tests, adjustments like reducing window size or removing identifiers can prevent confusion. For electronic readers, disable reporting for unapplied targets until authorized.

#### 14. COVID-19 Diagnostic Pathways and Manufacturer Notifications Update

QA Block 14-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are the notification pathways for antibody tests still viable pathways for manufacturers to use in order to market to high complexity settings while waiting for their EUA?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA confirms that notification pathways remain open as per current guidance. Manufacturers should contact the FDA if devices are not appearing on the notification page, as commercial manufacturers are typically required to notify.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are the notification pathways for antibody tests still viable pathways for manufacturers to use in order to market to high complexity settings while waiting for their EUA?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The notification pathways as spelled out in the current guidance are still open. I was not aware perhaps that some devices weren't showing up timely in the notification page. If that's the case, then that those developers should just reach out to the FDA and ask. Sometimes we don't require that notification to be posted, but I think for all commercial manufacturers we do.

#### 15. Acceptability of Lab-Validated Specimens in Clinical Trials

QA Block 15-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: In a clinical trial for a multi-analyte antigen detection test, if a reference RT-PCR assay does not have claims for a specific specimen type, but the reference laboratory we're using has validated that specimen type, is it acceptable to use the results from that lab-validated specimen as a reference?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends using fully EUA-authorized methods or fully cleared molecular tests without LDT modifications as comparators, as modifications to tests require FDA review and can make the process inefficient.
VERBATIM QUESTION: In a clinical trial for a multi-analyte antigen detection test, if a reference RT-PCR assay does not have claims for a specific specimen type, but the reference laboratory we're using has validated that specimen type, is it acceptable to use the results from that lab-validated specimen as a reference?
VERBATIM ANSWER: If it's modifications to an EUA test and the FDA hasn't reviewed and authorized those modifications, that's a challenge. If it's a fully cleared device and modifications have been made that haven't been FDA authorized, that is a challenge. We're not going to say no. But basically the modifications to the test would have to be reviewed and found to be authorizable, at the very least, in order for us to accept that data. So then you're asking our review team to not-- and actually, if it's an antigen test, then the antigen team would be reviewing the antigen test, and the molecular team would be reviewing the modifications to a molecular test. So that's just terribly inefficient. So that's why we do recommend that you use fully EUA- authorized methods that are acceptable as a comparator. Those are high sensitivity molecular tests. Or you can use a fully cleared or authorized molecular test without LDT modification. That's our recommendation. Once they know how to do it, but it will really muck up the system more than needed.
