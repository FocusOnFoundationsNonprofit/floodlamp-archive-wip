VERBATIM QUESTION: What guidance is there for patients to self-collect samples for EUA and validation?
VERBATIM ANSWER: All right, I think it's a relative straightforward matter. Obtain what type of samples that you're intending to use with that, that might differ from others and it would be helpful, I think, to have actually lay users demonstrate that they can do this. And that if they are going to shipping it, let me do the shipping study so that you can demonstrate that there are no issues related to shipment because most of these patients will not be positive, you can spike those samples with viral RNA in order to, you know, match the metrics that you intend to validate. And I'll turn it over to some of my colleagues here if I misspoke. If they want to add anything. Usually what you request is when you try to add a new specimen type is to have a comparison study between the approved or in this case authorized specimen type versus the new one. And so as Dr. Stenzel mentioned that would be an appropriate study to compare self-collected to what would be collected by healthcare provider and a shipping study as well.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the FDA's recommendations for deciding the level of a positive control relative to the assay's LOD?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends setting a positive control at 2 to 3 times the assay's LOD but advises testing to determine what works best for the specific assay.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the FDA's recommendations for deciding the level of a positive control relative to the assay's LOD?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Usually positive control is about 2 to 3X LOD with the assays. Those you have a sample that's very weak, low tighter or your positive control can still detect that. That's the average, but certainly you can - you may need to test what works with your assay.

VERBATIM QUESTION: How should labs establish the limit of detection (LOD) for assays they are independently developing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, so the LOD would be established with your unintelligible. They just among those that looked at the CDC assay. We are able to detect down to 2 to 5 viral copies with their assay. But that just gives you 2X to 3X LOD above that.

#### 21. Guidance on RUO Kits and EUA Evaluation

QA Block 21-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are kit manufacturers that are providing research use only (RUO) kits or availability of RUO kits allowed to supply individual labs to perform EUA evaluation according to the template?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: RUO components can be used to build non-laboratory-developed tests (NLBT), but complete kits should be submitted directly to the FDA for EUA authorization. Labs can purchase RUO components, develop their own test, validate it, notify the FDA, and begin testing.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are kit manufacturers that are providing research use only (RUO) kits or availability of RUO kits allowed to supply individual labs to perform EUA evaluation according to the template?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The way that the new policy reads is that RUO components can be used to build NLBT. So it was not intended for it to be a complete kit. And so, those manufacturers with the complete kit which will include all primers and probes and controls, instructions for use should come directly to us for EUA authorization, through the kit manufacturer route.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What should we do if our assay's limit of detection is less sensitive than another assay, like the CDC's assay?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA states that a less sensitive LOD may not have a meaningful clinical impact unless it is significantly less sensitive than the CDC's assay. Developers should assess this after determining their LOD.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What should we do if our assay's limit of detection is less sensitive than another assay, like the CDC's assay?
VERBATIM ANSWER: I think that's a perfect question once you know your LOD, and you are concerned about that. And I would say that most clinical samples even though they're going to be, some of them are at a high CT. Probably well above the limited detection of the CDC assay. So it would have to be an LOD that was significantly different from the CDC's in order to make any clinically meaningful impact on the testing.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What strategies are recommended by the FDA to stabilize RNA in contrived samples to prevent degradation?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends using stabilizing strategies, such as having stabilizing agents in the sample before spiking it with nucleic acid, and then promptly proceeding with RNA extraction. It is critical that nucleic acids go through the extraction process to simulate a clinical sample.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What strategies are recommended by the FDA to stabilize RNA in contrived samples to prevent degradation?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We recommend that you work on stabilizing strategies that you utilize in order to avoid degradation of the RNA when you spike it in the sample. What people have used is having the license unintelligible already in the sample and then you, at the later stage, add your appropriate amount of nucleic acid, the RNA and then immediately move onto the extraction. But from your, kind of, unintelligible perspective, it's important that you take the nucleic acid through the extraction process in order to mimic an appropriate contrived clinical sample.
