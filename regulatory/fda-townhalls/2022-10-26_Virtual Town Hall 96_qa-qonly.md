#### 2. Guidelines for Monkeypox Test Development and Validation

QA Block 2-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can an EUA-authorized monkeypox test be used for discordant analysis between the candidate device and the CDC test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Yes, an EUA-authorized monkeypox test can be used for discordant analysis if it is a PCR test validated for similar specimen type, has high sensitivity, and includes chemical lysis with nucleic acid extraction, as specified in FDA templates. Results from discrepant analysis should not affect NPA and PPA calculations but can be footnoted.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can an EUA-authorized monkeypox test be used for discordant analysis between the candidate device and the CDC test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: They can. As noted in the molecular diagnostic templates, we do recommend establishing a discordant analysis plan prior to your clinical studies. Excuse me. Discordant samples should be tested with an EUA‐authorized PCR test that has been validated for the same type of clinical specimen, has demonstrated high sensitivity, and uses a chemical lysis step followed by solid phase extraction of nucleic acids, such as silica bead extraction. And this is all discussed in the template. And we should also note that results from a discrepant analysis should not be included in the calculation of NPA and PPA but may be added to the performance table as a footnote.

#### 5. FDA Transition Plans for COVID-19 Device Policies

QA Block 5-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: With the implementation of the new COVID-19 test policy, is FDA planning to implement the transition plan for medical devices that fall within enforcement policies issued during the COVID-19 public health emergency soon?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA is working to finalize the draft transition guidance documents for medical devices, issued late last year. These drafts are not test-specific and address different scenarios than the updated COVID-19 test policy. The guidance focuses on transitioning devices under enforcement policies or Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) back to normal operations after the public health emergency or EUA declarations expire. The FDA cannot comment on estimated finalization dates, and stakeholders are advised to check the FDA website for updates.
VERBATIM QUESTION: With the implementation of the new COVID-19 test policy, is FDA planning to implement the transition plan for medical devices that fall within enforcement policies issued during the COVID-19 public health emergency soon?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So we have discussed the transition plan draft guidance documents on previous town halls. And as discussed, we are working to finalize those draft guidance documents. The drafts were issued late last year. And it's important to note that those two draft guidance documents are not test specific. They're for all medical devices that fall within enforcement policies or were issued EUAs during the COVID‐19 public health emergency. And they do address different situations than the newly updated COVID-19 test policy guidance. So the draft guidance document titled “Transition Plan for Medical Devices that Fall within Enforcement Policies Issued During the COVID‐19 Public Health Emergency” provides FDA's recommendations and expectations for devices under COVID‐19 related enforcement policies to transition back‐to‐normal operations when the public health emergency expires. And it is very important to note that the COVID‐19 test policy guidance is outside of the scope of that transition guidance. And then COVID‐19 tests that were issued EUAs are within the scope of the draft guidance document titled “Transition Plan for Medical Devices Issued Emergency Use Authorizations During the COVID‐19 Public Health Emergency,” which addresses the transition back‐to‐normal operations when the emergency use declarations that allowed for FDA to issue EUAs are no longer in effect. However, we're not able to comment on estimated finalization dates for draft guidances, so we do recommend that you keep an eye on FDA's website for any updates there.

#### 6. COVID-19 Emergency Use Authorization Application Updates

QA Block 6-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is the FDA still accepting COVID-19 EUA applications, or has it stopped?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA is still accepting COVID-19 EUA applications if the test aligns with the review priorities outlined in updated guidance from September 27. There is an active 564 emergency declaration allowing the FDA to issue EUAs, but applications will be evaluated for prioritization. Traditional marketing review may also be recommended depending on the situation.
VERBATIM QUESTION: OK. Quick question‐‐ I haven't joined these meetings in a long while. So I just wanted to double‐check if FDA is still accepting for COVID‐19 EUA application, or has that stopped?
VERBATIM ANSWER: I'll start this response, and then I'll hand it over to Toby. But we did update the COVID guidance on September 27 with some new review priorities. And as long as somebody develops the test and it's covered under the review priorities of September 27, then we would continue to accept those applications. Toby can provide some more color to that. Yeah. Thanks, Tim. So there is still an active 564 emergency declaration which gives us the authority to issue emergency use authorization as needed. So you are still able to submit emergency use authorization requests. And then we will evaluate them to determine whether they are something that we will prioritize. So we do recommend, as Tim mentioned, that you take a look at the guidance that was issued on September 27 which lists out the priorities for how we intend to prioritize EUA requests and where we recommend instead using a marketing review pathway‐‐ the traditional marketing review pathways. So take a look at that. And if you have any questions, you can send them into the mailbox. And if you decide to, you can submit an EUA request. And we will consider it and determine whether or not we will prioritize it and let you know.

VERBATIM ANSWER: So there is still an active 564 emergency declaration which gives us the authority to issue emergency use authorization as needed. So you are still able to submit emergency use authorization requests. And then we will evaluate them to determine whether they are something that we will prioritize. So we do recommend, as Tim mentioned, that you take a look at the guidance that was issued on September 27 which lists out the priorities for how we intend to prioritize EUA requests and where we recommend instead using a marketing review pathway‐‐ the traditional marketing review pathways. So take a look at that. And if you have any questions, you can send them into the mailbox. And if you decide to, you can submit an EUA request.

#### 8. Threshold for Ending Emergency Declarations and EUAs

QA Block 8-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Given the decreasing numbers of monkeypox in the US, is there a threshold at which FDA would basically remove the emergency declaration and no longer accept EUAs?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA explains that the decision to remove an emergency declaration and stop accepting EUAs is made by the Secretary. It is uncommon, not time-limited, and no such 564 determination has been revoked recently. Emergencies like these can recur, so discontinuation isn't typically rushed, as shown with ongoing EUAs for Ebola tests. There are no plans to cease the EUA for monkeypox.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Given the decreasing numbers of monkeypox in the US, is there a threshold at which FDA would basically remove the emergency declaration and no longer accept EUAs?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah, it's a good question. So in our government, there are at least three different determinations or declarations that the Secretary could make. And the Secretary makes these decisions. And it's our job at the FDA to initiate actions. So we have, what, six or seven previous emergency‐‐ EUA declarations for testing‐‐ IVD testing‐‐ that are still in force. So it's uncommon, and it's not time limited, these 564's, that the Secretary has to actively determine that the emergency no longer exists. And there's no longer a need for EUAs for IVD's. And so as I said, there hasn't been one that's been discontinued in a long time. And there's a reason for that. These things, once they happen, can come back. And if a test has not been fully authorized, if we remove the 564 determination, then those tests have to come off the market at some point, unless they come in for follow‐up innovation. And an illustrative example is Ebola. So Ebola is now somewhat of concern. And we hope that the current outbreak outside the U.S. extinguishes itself very quickly and doesn't put U.S. at risk. But we're very happy that there are EUA authorized tests for Ebola that have not been required to be removed from the market. So it's a big question. It's an important question. I don't see it happening anytime soon for monkeypox.

But when you're considering swabs from lesions, whether their a dry swabs or swabs specifically in ‐‐ lesion swabs specifically collected in VTM, and you are not going beyond the storage and shipping conditions that are on the CDC website, then no additional validation testing is needed. For crusts, that kind of goes beyond what we are generally expecting to see in EUAs. And so that would be something we would encourage you to discuss with us in a pre‐EUA, just as a sample type in general. But if you are wanting any other transport media type or any storage claims beyond what's on that CDC site for VTM lesion swabs and dry lesion swabs, then you would want to provide validation data.

VERBATIM QUESTION: If we want to claim swabs in VTM or lesion crusts, do we need to perform our own stability studies rather than refer to the recommendations of the CDC?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. So I want to distinguish crusts from the other assistant sample types that your mentioning. But when you're considering swabs from lesions, whether their a dry swabs or swabs specifically in ‐‐ lesion swabs specifically collected in VTM, and you are not going beyond the storage and shipping conditions that are on the CDC website, then no additional validation testing is needed. For crusts, that kind of goes beyond what we are generally expecting to see in EUAs. And so that would be something we would encourage you to discuss with us in a pre‐EUA, just as a sample type in general. But if you are wanting any other transport media type or any storage claims beyond what's on that CDC site for VTM lesion swabs and dry lesion swabs, then you would want to provide validation data. I hope that's clear.

QA Block 19-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Should irrelevant information be omitted when using a template to submit a supplement?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA advises that when submitting a supplement using a template, you only need to complete the relevant portions and can reference prior submissions instead of re-entering existing information.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Should irrelevant information be omitted when using a template to submit a supplement?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. I'll just add that, as Tim said, the templates are voluntary. They are very helpful for our reviewers if you do complete them and submit your EUA request with that information. It streamlines the review quite a bit for our review staff. And if you're needing to submit a supplement after authorization, typically you could just use the same template but only fill out the relevant portions of it. And that way it's still a format that our review staff are used to seeing, so they can find the information that they're looking for quickly and easily. But you don't need to re‐complete information that we already have. You can reference your previous submission.

QA Block 2-5
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What criteria should an EUA-authorized PCR test meet when used in discordant analysis for monkeypox diagnostics?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: An EUA-authorized PCR test used for discordant analysis in monkeypox diagnostics should be validated for the same clinical specimen type, demonstrate high sensitivity, and include a chemical lysis step followed by solid phase nucleic acid extraction, such as silica bead extraction. Results from discordant analysis should not be included in NPA and PPA calculations but may be mentioned in a performance table footnote.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What criteria should an EUA-authorized PCR test meet when used in discordant analysis for monkeypox diagnostics?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Discordant samples should be tested with an EUA‐authorized PCR test that has been validated for the same type of clinical specimen, has demonstrated high sensitivity, and uses a chemical lysis step followed by solid phase extraction of nucleic acids, such as silica bead extraction. And this is all discussed in the template. And we should also note that results from a discrepant analysis should not be included in the calculation of NPA and PPA but may be added to the performance table as a footnote.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Commander Kimberly Piermatteo (FDA)
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: Discordant analysis criteria, Monkeypox EUA PCR testing

TOPICS: low positive samples, monkeypox diagnostic test validation, use of convalescent samples
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 5-6
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Why is the COVID-19 test policy guidance excluded from the scope of the draft transition guidance documents?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The COVID-19 test policy guidance is excluded because the draft transition guidance documents focus on broader medical devices within enforcement policies or EUAs, addressing different situations than the test-specific policy guidance.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Why is the COVID-19 test policy guidance excluded from the scope of the draft transition guidance documents?
VERBATIM ANSWER: It's important to note that those two draft guidance documents are not test specific. They're for all medical devices that fall within enforcement policies or were issued EUAs during the COVID‐19 public health emergency. And they do address different situations than the newly updated COVID-19 test policy guidance. So the draft guidance document titled “Transition Plan for Medical Devices that Fall within Enforcement Policies Issued During the COVID‐19 Public Health Emergency” provides FDA's recommendations and expectations for devices under COVID‐19 related enforcement policies to transition back‐to‐normal operations when the public health emergency expires. And it is very important to note that the COVID-19 test policy guidance is outside of the scope of that transition guidance.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA allows temperature and humidity tests under the EUA to be conducted either together in parallel or separately, ensuring a range of storage conditions is tested.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is it acceptable to perform temperature and humidity testing separately for reagent stability studies under the EUA?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah. I think for the EUA, we have accepted that combined study. You can do that temperature with the humidity in parallel. Or you can do them separately as well. The intent there is to ensure that obviously that a range of conditions that may be experienced by the kit during storage are kind of tested.

VERBATIM QUESTION: When should we expect to hear feedback from the FDA regarding a COVID EUA application?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We are working our way through submissions that we've received. We are considering the priorities that are in the September 27, 2022 guidance update. And we are going through those and responding to the submitters as we are able to evaluate each submission on its merits. So as part of that, we'll go through and look and see does the submission‐‐ where does the submission fall, considering the new priorities that are described in the guidance, and if it is a test that we think will significantly benefit the public health. And we will respond back to each submitter. We can't give you a firm timeline for that as we are working through each of them. And our timeline will depend on many factors specific to each submission. But we will‐‐ you should expect to receive a response.
