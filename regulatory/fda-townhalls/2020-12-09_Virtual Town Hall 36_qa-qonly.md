#### 1. Updates on COVID-19 Testing Developments and Priorities

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the specific caveats about the use of pooling that test developers should be aware of?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA advises test developers to review all caveats in the authorizations for pooling and note that authorized pooling for asymptomatic screening is specified. Off-label use is possible as long as specific limitations, like restricting use to symptomatic patients, are not applied.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the specific caveats about the use of pooling that test developers should be aware of?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Please note all the caveats in our authorizations about the use of pooling. And of course if the pooling scheme has not yet been authorized for an asymptomatic screening we do clearly state on the FDA Web site and we're supported by both the CDC and the CMS that you can use the tests that off label as long as there is no specific limitation about the use, very specific use limitations to very rare perhaps authorizations about the limitations to only symptomatic patients.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Pooling guidelines, Test authorization, Off-label test use
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can tests be used off-label if they have no specific use limitations, and what constitutes a specific limitation on use?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA allows tests to be used off-label as long as there are no specific limitations on their use, such as authorizations restricting use to symptomatic patients.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can tests be used off-label if they have no specific use limitations, and what constitutes a specific limitation on use?
VERBATIM ANSWER: And of course if the pooling scheme has not yet been authorized for an asymptomatic screening we do clearly state on the FDA Web site and we're supported by both the CDC and the CMS that you can use the tests that off label as long as there is no specific limitation about the use, very specific use limitations to very rare perhaps authorizations about the limitations to only symptomatic patients.

QA Block 1-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are there any emerging data or guidelines supporting the use of panel tests for SARS-CoV-2 and flu detection?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA has authorized the first home collection panel test for SARS-CoV-2 and flu detection, signaling support for panel testing where supported by data.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are there any emerging data or guidelines supporting the use of panel tests for SARS-CoV-2 and flu detection?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We also saw more home collection kits authorized and of note the first home collection for a panel test that involves both SARS-CoV-2 and flu detection. And of course we signal with that authorization our continued desire to see panel testing in all forms that are supported by data.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: panel tests, SARS-CoV-2 and flu detection, test authorization
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What types of testing methodologies or formats does the FDA prioritize for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA prioritizes point-of-care tests, home collection kits, panel tests, and high-throughput systems for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics to enable efficient testing of large sample volumes.
VERBATIM QUESTION: IMPLICIT
VERBATIM ANSWER: We - and want to remind everyone of our current highest priorities. This is - this - the priorities in two ways, one for review but also in seeking development of these tests from the development community. so that obviously they really haven't changed recently and so they are again point of care tests, home collection kits from home testing opportunities, panels and extremely high throughput systems that allow the most efficient testing of large volumes of samples.

#### 2. Streamlining EUA Process for Open-Source LAMP-Based Assays

QA Block 2-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can you provide guidance on the use of a consolidated primer set for a LAMP-based assay, specifically addressing inclusivity in silico analysis, in silico cross-reactivity, and wet cross-reactivity?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA supports using consolidated primer sets as seen in models like Yale's SalivaDirect for open-source testing. Data on test performance can be leveraged via right of reference, either through individual EUA authorization or replication of an approved method. Changes in test components require review, but adherence to existing authorization setups reduces duplication and enhances efficiency.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can you provide guidance on the use of a consolidated primer set for a LAMP-based assay, specifically addressing inclusivity in silico analysis, in silico cross-reactivity, and wet cross-reactivity?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes that's - we've seen that as a pathway that could be very successful. Of course the Yale saliva direct was the first to get authorization and we see a lot of interest in this sort of open source. As far as, you know, the data related to test performance yes that can be leveraged in a different - you know, in multiple ways. The two main ways are that if you seek your own authorization for the test you can give a right of reference for anyone else who wants to copy your test. That wouldn't eliminate the requirement for them to if they're a kit developer say for them to come in to get their own authorization. And it wouldn't extend the umbrella of an EUA authorization to any lab that might copy that method. So looking at the saliva direct model they have in their original submission and any amendments -- and I have to check what amendments they have to date -- they have an instruction for use that is the sole basis so to speak of the kit. And they point to off-the-shelf product that users can purchase. In the case of primers and probes for their tests - Toby you can correct me but I think it's the CDC's. And they can get that from vendors that produce primary probes under that CDC authorization. So those are very specific catalog numbers and those are primers and probes that we previously authorized. So again there's these two different pathways. I want to lay them out very clearly. You can get your own individual authorization for a kit. You can then give anybody, any other developer the right of reference to that and they can copy it and they can pretty much link up and use the data in your submission. There are some elements that if they were to be changed that we'd want to see. But if they are using the same suppliers for everything - and the same catalog numbers for everything that you're using then that makes it very easy. Or the other way is to have this method authorized as we did for saliva direct and then you - we would envision giving you or any other sponsors the same sort of flexibility that Yale is actually the one that designates which lab can use their method and are therefore covered by their EUA. And they have commitments to the FDA on what is required in making that determination of designation. And my understanding is they've designated quite a few labs already. And I would refer you to them if anybody wants to know those numbers but it appears to be a very highly successful program. So hopefully I've addressed the questions and...

REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 2-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: If we get authorization for a test using one type of activation buffer and purification method, and another developer pursues authorization with a different purification method but the same primer set and LAMP master mix, would they need to repeat the interfering substances testing?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Additional validation may be required if changes are made to the test components. Developers can grant rights of reference, reducing duplication if core components remain the same.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If we get authorization for a test using one type of activation buffer and purification method, and another developer pursues authorization with a different purification method but the same primer set and LAMP master mix, would they need to repeat the interfering substances testing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: At a high level you're close. But the devil's sometimes in the detail. There are certain alterations to a test that we may require additional validation. So if they're adding something new that you didn't do say then we would want to evaluate the data around that change. And then you absolutely developers can give each other right of references as they so wish. They can specify what right they have or among their - from their entire EUA. They can have limitation or they can open them up entirely. But you can cross - basically cross reference each other's assays to the extent that you want. And there would absolutely be synergy. And if the components are all the same that they use for the core test then there would absolutely be synergy on reducing any sort of duplication that wouldn't - that isn't, you know, recommended because the tests are basically the same in those functions. Okay? So I look forward to hearing more about your development. Thank you so much.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Randy True (FloodLAMP PBC)
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Test validation requirements, Rights of reference between developers, Reducing duplication in testing
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 2-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: If we provide another developer a general right of reference for our test, allowing them to get their own EUA and control their own designations, while we maintain our own separate EUA and designations, is that the correct process?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Yes, developers can grant general rights of reference to others for separate EUAs, but changes to a test may require additional validation. Cross-referencing assays can reduce duplication if core components remain unchanged.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If we provide another developer a general right of reference for our test, allowing them to get their own EUA and control their own designations, while we maintain our own separate EUA and designations, is that the correct process?

TOPICS: Right of reference, EUA process, Validation requirements
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 2-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the specific criteria the FDA uses to determine when additional validation is required for alterations to an EUA authorized test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA evaluates changes to a test to determine if they require additional validation. This includes assessing data for any new aspects not included in the original test. If components remain the same, duplication of validation can often be minimized.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the specific criteria the FDA uses to determine when additional validation is required for alterations to an EUA authorized test?

REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 2-5
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the use of a shared primer set with identical suppliers and catalog numbers eliminate the need for independent validations for each developer?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Using the same suppliers and catalog numbers simplifies validation but does not entirely eliminate the need for independent evaluations.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the use of a shared primer set with identical suppliers and catalog numbers eliminate the need for independent validations for each developer?
VERBATIM ANSWER: But if they are using the same suppliers for everything - and the same catalog numbers for everything that you're using then that makes it very easy.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Randy True (FloodLAMP PBC)
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: shared primer sets, validation requirements, EUA pathways
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 2-6
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What commitments are required from developers in a model where they designate laboratories for use of their authorized test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Developers designating laboratories for their authorized test must meet FDA commitments for determining lab designations, as seen with the Yale SalivaDirect model.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What commitments are required from developers in a model where they designate laboratories for use of their authorized test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Or the other way is to have this method authorized as we did for saliva direct and then you - we would envision giving you or any other sponsors the same sort of flexibility that Yale is actually the one that designates which lab can use their method and are therefore covered by their EUA. And they have commitments to the FDA on what is required in making that determination of designation. And my understanding is they've designated quite a few labs already.

REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 2-7
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Under what circumstances would a developer opting for the saliva direct open-source model still need to perform new validations?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Developers using the saliva direct open-source model must perform new validations if they make alterations to the test not included in the original EUA submission. Using identical components can reduce duplication.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Under what circumstances would a developer opting for the saliva direct open-source model still need to perform new validations?

QA Block 2-8
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can the FDA clarify the flexibility extended to developers adopting a model similar to the Yale saliva direct approach?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA sees the Yale saliva direct model as a successful, flexible approach for test developers. Developers can seek their own authorization and grant authorization references for others to use. Alternatively, like saliva direct, methods can be authorized with a mechanism that allows sponsors to designate labs covered under their EUA, while ensuring compliance with FDA requirements.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can the FDA clarify the flexibility extended to developers adopting a model similar to the Yale saliva direct approach?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes that's - we've seen that as a pathway that could be very successful.

QA Block 2-9
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What processes do developers need to follow to give specific or limited rights of reference to another developer?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Developers can provide other developers with rights of reference for their EUA, specifying whether these rights are limited or full. Such cross-referencing reduces duplication if the tests use identical components.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What processes do developers need to follow to give specific or limited rights of reference to another developer?

#### 3. Point-of-Care Use of Antibody Test Kits

QA Block 3-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the FDA agree that point-of-care facilities can use both fingerstick and venous draw whole blood but not plasma and serum for antibody test kits authorized for point-of-care use?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Yes, point-of-care facilities can use both fingerstick and venous draw whole blood for antibody test kits authorized for such use, but not plasma or serum due to the training and equipment requirements.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA agree that point-of-care facilities can use both fingerstick and venous draw whole blood but not plasma and serum for antibody test kits authorized for point-of-care use?
VERBATIM ANSWER: That would be correct. There are point-of-care assays. Obviously say physician offices can draw a whole blood, and those offices are permitted to use whole blood in a point-of-care assay, yes absolutely. Yes it's a little - to add a synergy step for plasma or serum that would be in all likelihood something different. Although there are developers who are going to look at, you know, devices that might be able to use point-of-care but in general they're not - these facilities are not trained in using nitro fuses and maintaining them okay? So hopefully that clarifies that.

REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 3-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can devices designed to use plasma or serum be adapted for point-of-care use?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Devices using plasma or serum would require additional steps and are generally not suited for point-of-care because such facilities are not equipped to handle these processes.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can devices designed to use plasma or serum be adapted for point-of-care use?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes it's a little - to add a synergy step for plasma or serum that would be in all likelihood something different.

#### 4. Requirements for Retrospective Studies and Fresh Sample Testing

QA Block 4-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Do you still recommend five fresh samples for retrospective studies if dry fresh swabs, not in VTM but frozen, are used?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends using five fresh samples for retrospective studies as the device is intended to be used without freezing the swabs. Fresh sample studies can be completed post-market if authorization criteria are met. Freezing swabs may alter assay performance by making more target available.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Do you still recommend five fresh samples for retrospective studies if dry fresh swabs, not in VTM but frozen, are used?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Well the challenge is on that last question if you freeze the swabs then we've only evaluated data premarket on frozen swabs. And then we wouldn't wanted to require users to freeze those swabs. Most point-of-care sites don't have freezers to do that and obviously it would be very impractical. So yes we are recommending a minimum of five positives of fresh samples as the device is intended to be used. And we are providing a huge amount of flexibility in allowing the completion of the fresh sample studies post market if everything up to that point where we can make authorization decisions looks good. So hopefully that explains our thinking around that. For example, I'll just go a bit further. We have seen some potential evidence that freeze thaw may make more target available for some assays. And so that could actually improve your performance due to a freeze.

#### 5. Over-the-Counter COVID-19 Testing Developments and Validation Standards

QA Block 5-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Do you have information about tests mentioned by President Trump that don't require doctors to administer the test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA has provided recommendations for validating over-the-counter COVID-19 tests but has not yet authorized any. The FDA is open to non-prescription tests but requires higher performance standards when healthcare professionals are not involved.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Do you have information about tests mentioned by President Trump that don't require doctors to administer the test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So just on this, you know, something that I've been highlighting on calls and other situations and we've provided so-called OTC over-the-counter or direct to consumer recommendations for validation. To my knowledge we have not authorized one, although I have to check always on everything minute to minute. But we're entirely open to a SARS-test, a COVID test that does not require a prescription. And so I want to thank you for the opportunity to reiterate that. We do - if you look at our template, require a little bit higher performance when a physician or a clinician, a healthcare worker is not involved in the loop on testing. And that's because the consumer, the patient at home don't have the benefit of running the test results by their clinician to make sure that they are making the best possible interpretation of the findings and how it impacts their health or other people's health. So thank you again for that question.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA has provided validation recommendations for over-the-counter or direct-to-consumer COVID-19 tests but hasn't authorized any yet. They are open to approving tests that don't require a prescription, but these need higher performance standards since healthcare professionals are not involved in interpreting results.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are these tests that don't involve healthcare professionals similar to the ones we already have or are they true over-the-counter tests for COVID-19?

CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA has provided validation recommendations for over-the-counter or direct-to-consumer COVID-19 tests, requiring higher performance standards due to the lack of healthcare workers in the testing process. No such test has yet been authorized.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the FDA's validation recommendations for over-the-counter or direct-to-consumer COVID-19 tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So just on this, you know, something that I've been highlighting on calls and other situations and we've provided so-called OTC over-the-counter or direct to consumer recommendations for validation. To my knowledge we have not authorized one, although I have to check always on everything minute to minute. But we're entirely open to a SARS-test, a COVID test that does not require a prescription. And so I want to thank you for the opportunity to reiterate that. We do - if you look at our template, require a little bit higher performance when a physician or a clinician, a healthcare worker is not involved in the loop on testing. And that's because the consumer, the patient at home don't have the benefit of running the test results by their clinician to make sure that they are making the best possible interpretation of the findings and how it impacts their health or other people's health.

#### 6. AI Software Validation Requirements for COVID-19 Assays

QA Block 6-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What extent of software validation is required for a support vector machine used in COVID-19 assay classification?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA expects less extensive software documentation for EUAs compared to full authorizations, focusing on the critical components and ensuring no obvious errors that could lead to false results. Specific requirements depend on the software's use case, and developers should engage with the FDA early.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What extent of software validation is required for a support vector machine used in COVID-19 assay classification?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Okay no that's okay. I will attempt to answer in general. So for EUAs whenever software is involved they are typically not asking for the extensive software documentation that we would for a full authorization. And we instead want developers to focus on the most critical components prior to authorization. And that will somewhat be in dialogue with the review staff when they know about the details. And so that is - our intent is to at launch have no obvious errors in the software that can lead to false or inaccurate results. So it is going to be a much lower bar for EUAs. And exactly what that - the recommendations are from the FDA is somewhat dependent on the exact software and it's intended use and its point acquired use. So thanks for the question. I think it's, you know, important then to not to necessarily delay a submission and go overboard on software validation but engage early and often or at least early with the FDA on your particular device.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Is registration of the saliva collection device with the FDA sufficient to use it with any EUA-approved saliva tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The best short answer is to say no but to provide some more color to that. And Toby is this something that you want to handle today an area that you've been focusing on or you Crosstalk [...] Yes I think I didn't fully follow the question. But if you're asking whether you only need to register and list or whether there are other requirements, there generally are other requirements especially for saliva collection devices for RNA preservation. Those typically do need FDA authorization either in the form of clearance or approval or an EUA.

VERBATIM ANSWER: You're about 50% right. First of all absolutely we are welcoming any new panels that haven't been seen by us before as long as they have SARS-CoV-2 on it. We - because they're say for flu or RSV, there are current full authorized tests for those targets. We are asking for somebody who has not already gotten a panel authorized by the FDA, full authorization by the FDA and then they're adding SARS-CoV-2 to it, if someone's coming with an entirely new panel, maybe they're adding a panel to their previous SARS-CoV-2 test EUA, we want to see a little bit more data about those non-SARS-CoV-2 targets. And typically it has been the case where we have post-market commitments after EUA authorization to do additional studies on those target - on those non-SARS-CoV-2 targets in order to bring it up more in line with full authorization and enable an easier full authorization of those panels. So we want to provide assurances to everyone that the targets are working for those that have other full authorization. At the same time we want to make - be as least burdensome as possible and at least in the pre-market up to authorization decision.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can serology tests currently authorized be used as part of research to determine their potential use in assessing vaccine responses?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA has not authorized serology tests specifically for assessing vaccine responses but has authorized neutralizing and semi-quantitative antibody tests, which may aid research. Any direct use for this purpose would require substantial clinical studies.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can serology tests currently authorized be used as part of research to determine their potential use in assessing vaccine responses?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Now obviously that's an important research question. We have not authorized anything to date that would directly link to that. We've authorized some neutralizing antibody tests. We've authorized some semi quant test that may aid in the exploration and aid in the research of this question. You know, we are - the - in the manner in which you can directly support such an indication would be some sort of clinical study that might be fairly involved.

#### 13. Prescription vs. Over-the-Counter Antigen Test Requirements

QA Block 13-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the differences in performance required for a rapid antigen test to be designated as prescription versus nonprescription?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: For prescription tests, there may be age restrictions and validation for asymptomatic individuals is not generally required unless specifically claimed. Over-the-counter (OTC) tests must demonstrate accuracy for use by consumers, including use on asymptomatic and very young individuals, and safety for pediatric use. Minimal validation is needed, such as data from about 10 asymptomatic patients, and additional studies may be required post-market.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the differences in performance required for a rapid antigen test to be designated as prescription versus nonprescription?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So for rapid antigen tests in the home the prescription versus nonprescription, the prescription version can have some limitations. It may have an age limitation that for studies that validation perform say down to a certain age, you know, that the developer didn't at the time go any further down in age. And then of course we don't for any - for prescription based tests we do not have a recommendation to validate for asymptomatic patients other than if they want to make that specific claim. Then obviously if they want to make that specific claim that their test is authorized for asymptomatic screening then we would want to see asymptomatic data. But for every other prescription-based test we do not recommend validation in the asymptomatic population. However if you go to an entirely OTC over-the-counter direct to consumer where there is not a healthcare provider involved, the consumer decides that test is going to be performed on whether it's a symptomatic or an asymptomatic, the consumer gets to - is, you know, is going to be the one interpreting the test results for their situation. And so it - we look for evidence that that can all be done accurately. And of course in the home situation the consumer decides can do it on even very young individuals and on asymptomatic. So for OTC claims we are asking for and we're very - the burden is very low here. It's usually a minimum of about ten asymptomatic patients premarket authorization with sometimes additional post-market test, post-market studies. And then also if it's going to be used OTC in the home, we have to assume it's going to be used on kids. And so we want to see that it performs well in kids and that it's safe to perform in kids.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is there any hope that the serology test emergency use authorization application will be reviewed since we haven't even been assigned a primary reviewer yet?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA has received many serology applications and, due to resource limitations, is addressing them as rapidly as possible, aided by recent staff increases. Progress is evident, with about 65 decisions on serology tests made in the last two weeks.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is there any hope that the serology test emergency use authorization application will be reviewed since we haven't even been assigned a primary reviewer yet?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes so of course we have received literally hundreds of serology, in particular serology lateral flow submissions. And it is a resource limitation situation. With the recent surge as I described at the beginning of the call, we are making significant progress across the office and including the serology decisions. So we have in the last two weeks made -- let's see if I can do the math 20, 40, it looks to me like about 65 serology decisions in the last two weeks. So that is evidence that we are - the surge is working and we're going to be able to as rapidly as possible with additional resources that we have, we have with the last surge we again doubled our number of people on COVID applications. And unfortunately for those developers who have non-COVID applications into the agency at least some of them and/or will be submitting non-COVID applications, those applications could be impacted.

And I believe that we do for - sorry I'm not sure if you are talking about a test for point of care or for home use or non-lab use but for point of care where you would be at a CLIA, a site with a CLIA waiver certificate we would expect to see the point of care study done in the US to reflect that setting. For home use or non-lab use we would expect it to be reflective of US users. And so if it is done - if it is performed outside the US like Tim said we would just - we would expect to see justification for why that is still reflective of US users.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What constitutes a valid 'point-of-care' setting for FDA validation purposes?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: A valid 'point-of-care' setting for FDA validation reflects environments typical in the US, such as non-laboratory settings, primary care office staff, and non-laboratory physicians. High-complexity lab settings do not qualify as point-of-care settings.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What constitutes a valid 'point-of-care' setting for FDA validation purposes?
VERBATIM ANSWER: That's a great point Toby and I'll just give additional color to that. You know, in Europe the point of care sites and other parts of the world may not be similar to our point of care sites. So we have seen unfortunately "point of care studies" done in high complexity type lab environments and that is not a point of care study. We're looking at the types of users that would be in the US for point of care type of users that would be home use in the US truly in the home for example and truly in a point of care type situation with, you know, with non-laboratory physicians and other health practitioners and other primary care office staff type people.
