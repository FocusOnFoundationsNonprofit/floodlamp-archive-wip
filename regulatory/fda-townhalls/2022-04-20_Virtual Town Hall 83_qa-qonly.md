VERBATIM QUESTION: How can developers confirm if their test's expiration dating has been extended?
VERBATIM ANSWER: When a developer has an extension of the dating that the FDA has previously authorized, the FDA does authorize that. We do post that information on the FDA website where there is any updates to the authorizations. So you can check any test that recently has been authorized for an extended date. That datings in there. It is the responsibility of the test developer, the test manufacturer to then update their packages and their labeling for distribution. But they can also update customers in the field. And it's their responsibility to do that. And the FDA has been very flexible with product that has already been delivered to users, customers, whether they be any of those categories. And so those kits that are in the test that are already been distributed can be used for longer than the expiration dating on the box.

And in general, where there's a volume measurement, it's 500,000 tests per week within three months of authorization. So the reasoning behind this is at this point in the pandemic with well over 400 tests authorized and some others on the market while we're reviewing them, we want to focus our review efforts on those that are going to expand greatly capacity in the U.S. for testing. And so having these volumes is important to be able to be impactful at this point in the pandemic. So it's 500,000 tests per week within three months of authorization. We're authorizing some now that are way, way, way above that.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Commander Kimberly Piermatteo (FDA)

REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 3-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How do test developers justify test volume per instrument per week?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Test developers should provide a realistic estimate of throughput, including the number of available instruments and tests these instruments can perform. The FDA evaluates instrument throughput as part of the complete testing system workflow to ensure significant test volume can be achieved.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How do test developers justify test volume per instrument per week?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So regarding instrument throughput, so this we didn't spell out, but we're looking for a realistic estimate of the total throughput, so not just the number of tests that are available for the U.S. market, but how many if there is an instrument, how many instruments are going to be available in the U.S. to be able to support that minimum testing throughput? So we're looking at a realistic estimate of the throughput at either CLIA waiver sites or even if it's over the counter, it's a home test to be able to support a significant volume. So we do look at this as a complete testing system, sample to answer workflow, to evaluate the instrument throughput. So we'll look at how many realistically, how many tests could be run per instrument and at a point of care sites or at home to be able to look at that overall number. So the developers should make sure that they're producing instruments at the level that can support the minimum or number of tests per week.

#### 5. Guidelines for COVID-19 Breath Test Development and EUA Process

QA Block 5-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can test developers reference the InspectIR COVID-19 Breathalyzer EUA summary for recommended studies for COVID-19 tests using GC-MS platforms?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Yes, test developers can reference the InspectIR COVID-19 Breathalyzer EUA summary for recommended studies for COVID-19 tests using GC-MS platforms. FDA also encourages developers to submit pre-EUAs as there may be nuances to new platforms.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can test developers reference the InspectIR COVID-19 Breathalyzer EUA summary for recommended studies for COVID-19 tests using GC-MS platforms?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, thanks. So there is no template for breath tests intended for asymptomatic screening for COVID‐19. This particular question didn't mention that it was a breath test, but that's our assumption. And yes, for breath tests it is appropriate to reference the InspectIR COVID‐19 Breathalyzer EUA summary for recommended analytical and clinical validation studies to support EUA authorization for COVID‐19 testing using a GC‐MS approach. We're also glad to engage with breath test developers during the review of a pre‐EUA. And that is likely a good approach because this is a new kind of technology. And there may be nuances to a new platform when compared with the InspectIR platform. So we would welcome pre‐EUAs ways for these types of tests.

#### 10. Antigen Test Performance Based on Symptom Onset Timeline

QA Block 10-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the claim testing population for an antigen test need to capture the number of days since symptom onset?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA requires antigen test claim testing populations to include data on the number of days since symptom onset because performance assessment is critical, especially within the first five days of symptoms. Clinical sensitivity can influence how far beyond this period the test remains effective.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the claim testing population for an antigen test need to capture the number of days since symptom onset?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So we do need date from symptom onset. Antigen tests have a narrower window for performance than molecular tests as is well known. And we want to make sure that the initial window from symptoms is adequately assessed and we know the performance, particularly in the first five days of symptoms. Some antigen tests have gone out further than five days, seven days and some longer. And that depends on the clinical sensitivity of the test. The more sensitive the test is, sometimes the more days that they can extend. But sometimes that's just the determination of how many days of symptoms from onset that a developer wishes to pursue and the inclusion exclusion criteria that they set for their clinical study.

#### 11. Breath Testing Validation and Pre-EUA Submission Guidelines

QA Block 11-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: When conducting a clinical study for a breath test, is it necessary to use InspectIR as the comparator method?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: No, it is not mandatory to use InspectIR as the comparator. FDA recommends submitting a pre-EUA, consulting publicly available information on the first authorized breath test, and designing studies accordingly. FDA will evaluate proposals and provide feedback.
VERBATIM QUESTION: When conducting a clinical study for a breath test, is it necessary to use InspectIR as the comparator method?
VERBATIM ANSWER: No, no, so if you, I recommend you send a pre‐EUA in. And we have a breath test, believe it or not, we have a breath test team that can make an assessment of how you want to validate this and how you and can give you feedback on that and any other recommendations you might seek that apply. I would look at the current authorized breath test. And look at the studies that they did. We are asking for more studies, more patients in those studies than we do for the known technologies of serology antigen tests and molecular. Unfortunately, we've seen many novel technologies that have not been able to do as good a job as we would like. And so the new technologies, until they're firmly established looking at the same potentially the same markers in the same manner, we're going to be in a situation where we do we need more information to be able to make our assessment. So I think you'll get a good idea of what we're looking for in the publicly available information on the FDA website about that first breath test.

#### 19. FDA Guidance on Pre-Filled Tubes for Antigen Tests

QA Block 19-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is the change from a screw cap to a pre-sealed aluminum foil reagent tube mandatory by the FDA or just a manufacturer's decision?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA has not made the change mandatory but prefers pre-filled tubes to reduce usability issues, improve safety, and ensure user-friendly workflows. However, tests with extra steps are still authorized.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is the change from a screw cap to a pre-sealed aluminum foil reagent tube mandatory by the FDA or just a manufacturer's decision?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So far we don't have that recommendation. But we do like to see that any tubes that come with the assay ideally are pre‐filled. Any time a user or even a laboratory user or a CLIA waived site user, especially maybe a home user, if they have to transfer liquids, it is an extra step. And it does cause more usability issues. And we put out a safety communication for because some home users have taken the buffer that comes in a separate tube that they add to another tube and thought it was eye drops and put it in their eyes. So those are the sort of safety things we would like to avoid. But obviously, we've authorized tests that have that. It's more a usability. We are encouraging developers to make this as easy as possible for users. I mean, there are some users who benefit from easier workflow. And they may have, say vision issues or dexterity issues and things like that. So the easier the workflow is the better it's going to be for everybody.

QA Block 10-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What factors determine the timeframe for a clinical study evaluating the performance of an antigen test based on symptom onset?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The timeframe for a clinical study evaluating an antigen test depends on the initial window of performance, focusing on the first five days after symptom onset. It can extend further based on the test's clinical sensitivity and the developer's inclusion and exclusion criteria.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What factors determine the timeframe for a clinical study evaluating the performance of an antigen test based on symptom onset?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So we do need date from symptom onset. Antigen tests have a narrower window for performance than molecular tests as is well known. And we want to make sure that the initial window from symptoms is adequately assessed and we know the performance, particularly in the first five days of symptoms. Some antigen tests have gone out further than five days, seven days and some longer. And that depends on the clinical sensitivity of the test. The more sensitive the test is, sometimes the more days that they can extend. But sometimes that's just the determination of how many days of symptoms from onset that a developer wishes to pursue and the inclusion exclusion criteria that they set for their clinical study.
