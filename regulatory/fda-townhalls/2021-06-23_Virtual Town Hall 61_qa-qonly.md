#### 1. FDA Updates on SARS-CoV-2 Testing and Innovations

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What challenges do falling SARS positivity rates pose for COVID-19 test developers?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Falling SARS positivity rates in the US are challenging for test developers due to difficulties in acquiring positive samples for validation and testing.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What challenges do falling SARS positivity rates pose for COVID-19 test developers?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We continue to see SARS positivity rates fall in the US. That's great. We do continue to see the Delta variant increasing in the percentage of the positives, and it's - Delta variant rise is particularly in those who are unvaccinated, which, there are in some areas of the country, a large number of unvaccinated adults. So, we're monitoring this closely, and hope all is well. But we're pleased with the overall rates falling, as we'll get into in some questions today, and, you know, there is some challenges when the rates are falling for test developers.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Falling SARS positivity rates, Test development challenges
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the FDA's stance on submissions for novel diagnostic technologies that were previously unrecognized?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA supports the review of new, novel, and unique diagnostic technologies, recommending developers engage through the pre-EUA process to evaluate potential fit under EUA review criteria and their contribution to pandemic response.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the FDA's stance on submissions for novel diagnostic technologies that were previously unrecognized?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We will see new technologies be developed that could be helpful in this pandemic. And our stated priorities are not intended to cover those things that we don't know about, or are new. Our stated priorities largely revolve around detection of Immunoglobulins, the raise to natural infection for SARS or a typical serology test, antigen tests, and molecular tests. So there are technologies that are new, novel, unique, and may come to bear and be helpful. And we recommend that you check with us through the pre-EUA process to see if it's something that we think would fall under the EUA review criteria and that we think has potential to impact in a positive manner, our pandemic response.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: novel diagnostic technologies, EUA process, FDA review priorities
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How should T Cell functional assay developers approach the FDA for EUA review?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Developers of T Cell functional assays should engage with the FDA through the pre-EUA process. The FDA is actively reviewing these assays and encourages developers to work on EUA submissions if their technology shows potential.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How should T Cell functional assay developers approach the FDA for EUA review?
VERBATIM ANSWER: And I will call out one particular type of test now that is emerging, and we've heard about, and that has to do with T Cell assays. We have authorized already a T Cell receptor sequencing beta-receptor sequencing assay. That particular assay functions largely in a way a typical serology assay doesn't in that we're looking at a T Cell receptor response to SARS-CoV-2. There are other T Cell assays that are more looking at functional T Cell response, and those are the newer types of assays that we're hearing about. So, you know, I just want to state that these types of new technologies, want to hear about through the pre-EUA process. If we think there's potential, we want to work with the developers to work on an EUA submission. And we are absolutely receiving these T Cell functional assays now for review, and do hope that ultimately they will pan out to be helpful, although I think there's a lot of open questions that remain. But we're committed to reviewing those right now.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: T Cell functional assays, EUA review process, FDA guidance
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What criteria should international studies meet for use in EUA and full authorization submissions, particularly for point-of-care tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA is open to international studies for positive sample acquisition for EUA and full authorization, especially when US positivity rates are low. Studies must comply with recommendations, including point-of-care setting use and language requirements.
VERBATIM QUESTION: IMPLICIT
VERBATIM ANSWER: We are also now very open to the use of international studies to acquire positive samples. That's both for EUA and for conversions. So we've done this in the past when rates of positivity in the US are too low, or are relatively low and are very challenging to developers, such as pathogens such as Ebola, TB, malaria, dengue fever. So we've done this in the past. And now that we are seeing falling rates in the US, we are more open to the use of international studies. We do want to make sure that they are done as we recommend. For example, if they're point of care tests, that the settings that they're evaluating in internationally, are truly point of care. We want to make sure that the language requirements are there. You know, non-US foreign language instruction should not be used to instruct non-US users of the test. And this applies - point of care can apply also to home tests if the appropriate settings are used for evaluating home tests. This is all in an effort to get actual positive patient samples for the validation, which is always preferable to the alternatives, which is why we're encouraging that now.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Use of international studies, Criteria for EUA submissions, Point-of-care test validation
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-5
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Why does the FDA discourage the use of non-US foreign language instructions for point-of-care tests developed with international studies?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA discourages the use of non-US foreign language instructions to ensure the tests are properly understood and used in the intended settings.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Why does the FDA discourage the use of non-US foreign language instructions for point-of-care tests developed with international studies?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We want to make sure that the language requirements are there. You know, non-US foreign language instruction should not be used to instruct non-US users of the test.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Non-US instructions, Point-of-care tests, International studies
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-6
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the requirements for a full set of frozen samples and fresh sample validation for point-of-care authorization?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA requires a minimum of 30 positive and 30 negative frozen samples for point-of-care claims, plus at least five prospectively collected positive samples. Post-authorization, a fresh sample prospective study must be completed.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the requirements for a full set of frozen samples and fresh sample validation for point-of-care authorization?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So, for - as I said, for point of care, so we would want to see a full set of a minimum of 30 positives and 30 negatives with the frozen banked samples for a point of care claim. And then we would authorize that test if we saw a minimum of at least five prospectively collected positive samples with successful performance, in addition to the frozen samples. So we do want a complete set of frozen samples so we can evaluate frozen samples and sample type. And we're willing to authorize them with a minimum of at least five prospectively collected positive samples. And again, those can be international if needed. And then post-authorization, we would expect the study to complete a fresh sample prospective study, so that we have a complete set of fresh samples to understand performance and to continue to allow the test to be marketed in the US.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Frozen and fresh sample validation, Point-of-care test authorization
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-7
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Why does the FDA recommend swab pooling over media pooling for point-of-care settings?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends swab pooling over media pooling in point-of-care settings because media pooling poses risks of mix-ups and cross-contamination when tests are performed by untrained individuals, whereas swab pooling offers a safer alternative and allows for straightforward follow-up if needed.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Why does the FDA recommend swab pooling over media pooling for point-of-care settings?
VERBATIM ANSWER: For point of care tests, we are recommending that you consider swab pooling, and we do not recommend media pooling in the point of care. In that setting, with untrained non-laboratorians performing the testing, media pooling presents some inherent risks of a mix-up and cross-contamination that we do not feel that that - that the benefit-risk profile on point of care settings justifies media pooling. However, I think swab pooling is a great alternative, especially in the point of care setting, where you can then potentially relatively easily follow up with an additional swab for those pools that test positive.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: swab pooling, media pooling, point-of-care testing
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-8
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the FDA's priorities and recommendations for panel tests as non-SARS respiratory viruses become more prevalent?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA prioritizes high volume, multi-analyte panel tests to increase testing efficiency and capacity, especially for central labs, point-of-care, and home prescription use. Over-the-counter multi-analyte tests are not recommended due to lack of data on asymptomatic non-SARS testing.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the FDA's priorities and recommendations for panel tests as non-SARS respiratory viruses become more prevalent?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Next question has to do with priorities, having to do with panel tests, particularly as we may see a rising prevalence of non-SARS respiratory viruses. We have stated our priorities for review currently where our position is focusing on increased testing, accessibility, and capacity. Panel tests have the ability to be more efficient, because we don't know whether it's SARS or some other virus, and you end up doing two tests versus one. That's less efficient. It uses more resources and supplies. So we continue to prioritize high volume, multi-analyte devices, including, central lab, of course, but including point of care and home RX tests. We are not recommending multi-analyte tests for over the counter, which could very well include testing of asymptomatic. We just don't have any experience of using non-SARS tests in the asymptomatic population. But home RX is acceptable and is what we recommend if you're interested in a home multi-analyte device.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Panel tests, FDA priorities, Non-SARS respiratory viruses
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-9
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is a prescription home test for symptomatic individuals sufficient without OTC approval for access?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: A prescription home test for symptomatic individuals is sufficient without OTC approval. Validation on symptomatic individuals in the US or internationally is acceptable, and the test will be authorized with typical language for suspected COVID cases without asymptomatic claims. The serial testing claim is optional.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is a prescription home test for symptomatic individuals sufficient without OTC approval for access?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. So that's been the pathway so far. We know - we've heard from multiple commercial parties that there is value in having a prescription home test. And you don't absolutely need an over-the-counter test to access the home test situation. And, you know, if you do your validation on symptomatic individuals in the US or ex- US, that's fine. We'll authorize the test. It will be the typical language of authorization that is, the patient is suspected of having COVID, and there won't be any claims about asymptomatic screening. And then, of course, if in a symptomatic population, the performance is acceptable for our - serial testing and pooling - not pooling, serial testing pathway for getting any symptomatic screening claim with a PPA of at least 80%, or lower bound of at least 70%, you always have the option at that point after submission or in your submission, to ask for the serial testing claim. The serial testing claim is not required. And if you want a single-use home antigen or molecular test in the symptomatic population only, that's fine. We'll definitely take a look at that.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Prescription home tests, Symptomatic use, OTC approval
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-10
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the FDA's position on the use of cycle threshold values for excluding test subjects in clinical studies?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA does not recommend using cycle threshold (CT) values to exclude test subjects in studies because CT values are not reliable indicators of infectivity.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the FDA's position on the use of cycle threshold values for excluding test subjects in clinical studies?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We are still not recommending exclusion of test subjects based on CT values. There's multiple sources that say that CT values are not reliable enough to predict whether someone's infectious, for example. So, we are still not recommending use of CT values to exclude test results from the clinical study.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: cycle threshold values, clinical study methodology, test subject exclusion
REVIEW FLAG: False


#### 2. Evaluating Dual Uses of Gene Expression Test

QA Block 2-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Would the FDA consider a gene expression test that detects SARS-CoV-2 and other viral pathogens, measures host response, and generates a risk score under EUA?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA sees two distinct intended uses for such a test: one for diagnosis and another for patient management. These would require separate validation. FDA recommends discussing this in a pre-EUA context and providing robust data linking human gene expression markers with infection for the diagnostic claim, along with details on the risk score's use in patient care.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Would the FDA consider a gene expression test that detects SARS-CoV-2 and other viral pathogens, measures host response, and generates a risk score under EUA?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The challenge here, and this is assuming that the test just measures the human gene expression markers, is that these are two different intended uses. I think the diagnostic claim is one intended use, and then the risk score is a different type of intended use, perhaps at the patient management type of use. And so, those would be two different validation recommendations for those two claims. If it hasn't been previously granted an EUA, which I'm assuming it hasn't, you know, we'd definitely like to discuss this in a pre-EUA setting. We'd want to know a little bit more about how the risk score is used for patient management. And seeing a robust study establishing the link between human expression markers and the infection for the diagnostic claim, also would be important to flesh out.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Kris Roth (FDA)
TOPICS: Gene expression testing, EUA process, Diagnostic vs. patient management
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 2-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Would the FDA consider such a test similar to a molecular test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA sees such tests as having different intended uses: one for diagnostics and another for patient management, requiring distinct validations. More data and discussion in a pre-EUA setting would be necessary.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Would the FDA consider such a test similar to a molecular test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The question is, would we consider this under EUA, and specifically similar to a molecular test? I think that the challenge here, and this is assuming that the test just measures the human gene expression markers, is that these are two different intended uses. I think the diagnostic claim is one intended use, and then the risk score is a different type of intended use, perhaps at the patient management type of use. And so, those would be two different validation recommendations for those two claims. If it hasn't been previously granted an EUA, which I'm assuming it hasn't, you know, we'd definitely like to discuss this in a pre-EUA setting.

SPEAKER ANSWER: Kris Roth (FDA)
TOPICS: Gene expression tests, EUA process, Test validation
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 2-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the separate validation recommendations for a diagnostic claim versus a risk score claim?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The validation recommendations differ because the diagnostic claim involves detecting and linking human expression markers to an infection, while the risk score addresses patient management and requires information on its use and supporting studies.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the separate validation recommendations for a diagnostic claim versus a risk score claim?
VERBATIM ANSWER: I think the challenge here, and this is assuming that the test just measures the human gene expression markers, is that these are two different intended uses. I think the diagnostic claim is one intended use, and then the risk score is a different type of intended use, perhaps at the patient management type of use. And so, those would be two different validation recommendations for those two claims.

VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the process for discussing novel test designs in a pre-EUA setting?
VERBATIM ANSWER: If it hasn't been previously granted an EUA, which I'm assuming it hasn't, you know, we'd definitely like to discuss this in a pre-EUA setting. We'd want to know a little bit more about how the risk score is used for patient management.

#### 3. Validation of Molecular Tests Using Banked and Fresh Samples

QA Block 3-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What criteria must banked samples meet to be acceptable for validation in molecular diagnostic tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Banked samples used for validation must be collected in an unbiased manner, and consecutively include both positives and negatives. Commercially banked samples are acceptable, but they should contain results reflecting fresh and prospectively collected samples where possible.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What criteria must banked samples meet to be acceptable for validation in molecular diagnostic tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: And so, here for molecular tests, there is this option to use banked samples. So we do want to test validation to be performed in the point of care setting by point of care users. And we feel that they are expert enough to collect samples in general. So, we're not trying to test their ability always to collect samples, but we want to know, can they accurately perform the test, this novel test that hasn't been seen by them before? In a busy point of care setting, in their normal workflow through seeing patients testing and not testing. So, we don't have similar restrictions on the use of banked samples. We would like to see an attempt at prospectively collected samples, and see some fresh sample results. And then we do want to understand the details about the samples to make sure that they were collected and used and selected in an unbiased fashion. Commercially banked samples are acceptable in this case as well, but we don't want, you know, we only high positives picked from that banked sample collection, and that - and typically, when you use banked samples, you want consecutively collected samples, including positives and negatives.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: criteria for banked samples, molecular diagnostic validation, sample collection bias
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 3-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is it mandatory to validate a test using prospectively collected samples in addition to banked samples?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA allows the use of banked samples for molecular test validation but prefers attempts with prospectively collected samples and fresh sample results to ensure unbiased collection and testing accuracy.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is it mandatory to validate a test using prospectively collected samples in addition to banked samples?

However, due to workload limitations, non-SARS Q-subs and pre-subs are not being reviewed unless they are related to COVID, companion diagnostics, breakthroughs, or have significant public health impact. The FDA advises consulting similar decision summaries for guidance.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are we doing regarding non-SARS pre-subs and Q-subs?
VERBATIM ANSWER: While previously, we had paused some non-COVID tests, including 510k submissions. We have now restarted all - completely all of those reviews as of June 10th. And we do not intend to pause any more going forward, you know, barring some unfortunate events, of course. And however, we're still limited in our capacity due to the overall workload in the office to review many of the Q-subs and pre-subs. So, you know, unless the IVD pre-sub is related to COVID, which we are reviewing, or companion diagnostics, which we're reviewing, or a breakthrough designation request and follow-up pre-subs for that, or it is determined in some other way being a highly significant public health impact, we are unable to review them at the time due to workload constraints. We - and that's probably going to be the case for the remainder of the year. We are - do recommend that you take - if you're in this situation, obviously, if it's not breakthrough request, in many cases, there are previous similar decision summaries that are publicly available, and we urge you, or recommend that you go look at those decision summaries. The more recent ones are going to be potentially better to look at our most current thinking on validation of those tests, so that hopefully the vast majority or all your questions that might be posed in the pre-sub, can be addressed by reviewing those decision summaries.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA has resumed reviewing all non-COVID submissions, such as 510k submissions, but is still limited in capacity to review most Q-subs and pre-subs unless they are COVID-related, companion diagnostics, breakthrough designation, or of high public health significance.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can test developers still submit non-COVID pre-subs or Q-subs even if review timelines are uncertain?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So, while previously, we had paused some non- COVID tests, including 510k submissions. We have now restarted all - completely all of those reviews as of June 10th. And we do not intend to pause any more going forward, you know, barring some unfortunate events, of course. And however, we're still limited in our capacity due to the overall workload in the office to review many of the Q-subs and pre-subs. So, you know, unless the IVD pre-sub is related to COVID, which we are reviewing, or companion diagnostics, which we're reviewing, or a breakthrough designation request and follow-up pre-subs for that, or it is determined in some other way being a highly significant public health impact, we are unable to review them at the time due to workload constraints. We - and that's probably going to be the case for the remainder of the year.

We - and that's probably going to be the case for the remainder of the year. We are - do recommend that you take - if you're in this situation, obviously, if it's not breakthrough request, in many cases, there are previous similar decision summaries that are publicly available, and we urge you, or recommend that you go look at those decision summaries. The more recent ones are going to be potentially better to look at our most current thinking on validation of those tests, so that hopefully the vast majority or all your questions that might be posed in the pre-sub, can be addressed by reviewing those decision summaries.

#### 5. Guidance on Usability and Clinical Studies Requirements

QA Block 5-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are usability studies from outside the US acceptable for submission?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA accepts usability studies primarily conducted in the US, as they are capable of being carried out there. Clinical studies requiring positive samples may be conducted outside the US if samples cannot be collected domestically.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are usability studies from outside the US acceptable for submission?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So usability studies should be easily done within the US. It's the clinical studies where you need actual positives that we see the need in some cases where a sponsor has demonstrated they can't get prospectively collective partners in the US, that we would go outside the US. So, you know, you don't - Chris, correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think you need actually, you know, truly symptomatic people to do the usability studies in the US. You don't need positives to do usability studies in the US. So, you know, that's probably still very capable if you're in the US, but as far as the actual clinical studies, collecting positive or negative samples, particularly positive samples that they were unable to collect in the US, we do want to provide a clear pathway to you ex-US.

#### 6. Evaluating Serology Tests for Post-Vaccine Spike Protein Detection

QA Block 6-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is FDA amenable to a qualitative lateral flow test targeting the spike protein for use on vaccinated individuals at point of care, not at home?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA is currently waiting on data from ongoing studies to determine meaningful benchmarks for serology tests post-vaccine. Until that data is available, FDA suggests developers pause and consider that fully quantitative results might be necessary for test utility.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is FDA amenable to a qualitative lateral flow test targeting the spike protein for use on vaccinated individuals at point of care, not at home?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So, I think you're talking about serology tests. And so, currently, we do not know really the hallmarks in a serology test of actual protection and/or immunity, whether it's natural infection or following a vaccine. So, the studies are relatively easily done to show that given test can detect positive reactions, positive immune responses to infection and/or vaccines. However, until we really understand what it means to have a positive test post- vaccine, and those studies are ongoing, US government-funded studies. And we hope within weeks or months, we'll have that data. That data, we believe, will be made publicly available very soon after the results are known. And the FDA is very eager to see that information as well. It's at that point that we would entertain in - and we recommend that developers pause with us in their development work to see what that means. It may be that a fully quantitative result is needed. We think that's likely the case, based on other post-vaccine tests we've authorized for rubella, where we know the sterilizing level link to international units for rubella. And so, we believe that it's probably going to- we hope that's going to be the case for SARS. We do believe it's going to be similar to rubella and other such vaccine tests, that it's really quantitative result linked to an international standard, is going to be the way to go, and able to provide useful information to clinicians based on serology testing.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What does the FDA currently recommend developers do while waiting for data on post-vaccine serology test hallmarks of protection?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA advises developers to pause their work until government studies on post-vaccine serology test hallmarks of protection provide clarity. These studies are expected to reveal whether quantitative results tied to international standards are necessary.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What does the FDA currently recommend developers do while waiting for data on post-vaccine serology test hallmarks of protection?

CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA is awaiting further data from ongoing studies to determine if quantitative serology tests linked to an international standard will be needed for post-vaccine evaluation. Preliminary insights suggest that such an approach, similar to rubella testing, may be likely.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is there a need for serology tests to provide quantitative results linked to an international standard for post-vaccine evaluation?

QA Block 6-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What level of antibody response would be considered clinically relevant for post-vaccination serology tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA does not yet define a clinically relevant antibody response for post-vaccination serology tests. Studies are ongoing, and future data will help determine if a quantitative measure linked to an international standard is needed, similar to rubella vaccine tests. Current understanding is insufficient, especially for scenarios like immunocompromised individuals.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What level of antibody response would be considered clinically relevant for post-vaccination serology tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Currently, we do not know really the hallmarks in a serology test of actual protection and/or immunity, whether it's natural infection or following a vaccine... It may be that a fully quantitative result is needed. We think that's likely the case, based on other post-vaccine tests we've authorized for rubella, where we know the sterilizing level link to international units for rubella... It could be that, and particularly say in immunocompromised individuals, that a low level of an antibody response is not protective at all.

QA Block 6-5
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What specific baseline and follow-up testing is required for US authorization of serology tests related to COVID-19 vaccines?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: For US authorization of serology tests, FDA requires baseline negative serology tests prior to vaccination with all authorized vaccines and follow-up testing approximately four weeks after completing vaccination. This applies separately for each vaccine type.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What specific baseline and follow-up testing is required for US authorization of serology tests related to COVID-19 vaccines?
VERBATIM ANSWER: … really for serology tests, we're looking for two things. One is this clinical relevance that's being addressed by these studies. And then second, we will ask for testing of, at least in the US, for US authorization, a minimum number of positive - of baseline negative serology tests prior to vaccination, with each of the authorized vaccines. Currently, there's three authorized vaccines. And then likely in the neighborhood of four weeks post-vaccination for each of the vaccines. Obviously one individual is not going to get - usually not to get more than one of the vaccine. So, for each of the three currently authorized vaccines, we'd be recommending at that point, just to give everybody a flavor of what we're going to be asking for, a baseline just prior to vaccination, showing a negative result with the candidate serology test. And roughly, we think their conversion is going to be somewhere around four weeks post-vaccination, post the last dose. So if it was a single-dose vaccine, four weeks after the first dose of that dose vaccine, or if it's a two-dose vaccine, it's four weeks after the second dose. That's, unfortunately, the most we can say right now, barring additional information that comes in through these very pivotal studies.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Should developers consider including natural infection markers in serology tests to differentiate between vaccination and prior infection?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA acknowledges that combining spike protein serology tests and N-protein tests might determine whether an individual had a natural infection versus just vaccination, but stresses the need to await outcome studies.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Should developers consider including natural infection markers in serology tests to differentiate between vaccination and prior infection?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Of course, yes. Although clinicians can - I know this isn't in current serology labeling that they can choose to say, I want to know the patient who is now vaccinated ever had, you know, an infection, a natural infection. And so, a combination of a spike protein serology test and separately ordered N- protein tests, could potentially inform whether it's just a vaccine situation, or it may have been vaccine and natural infection in their history. And again, we really want to wait the clinical outcome studies following vaccination, or natural infection. Those studies are ongoing, but most studies are focused on post-vaccination responses, and see what all that means and what criteria may be needed to understand and truly identify.

#### 7. Challenges in Serology Test Validation and Sample Collection Strategies

QA Block 7-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is there any issue with validating a comparator assay for neutralizing antibody tests using plasma samples or a combination of serum and plasma, when one clinical agreement study involves the collection of serum samples?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends using the gold standard PRNT test for comparison studies and advises using the appropriate scientifically validated sample type, which could involve further discussion if a non-claimed matrix is used. Plasma and serum specifics for PRNT should be clarified with FDA serology experts.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is there any issue with validating a comparator assay for neutralizing antibody tests using plasma samples or a combination of serum and plasma, when one clinical agreement study involves the collection of serum samples?
VERBATIM ANSWER: You know, I'm not a neutralizing antibody expert on the PRNT for the gold standard. Chris, maybe you can help me out on this response. And I don't remember if it's plasma or serum that is used on the PRNT test, but that is the gold standard. That's what we do recommend that you validate for a comparison study. And I just don't remember the sample type. Whatever the appropriate sample type is - scientifically known, is going to be allowable for our reviewers. And, you know, we just recommend those banked older samples because we know that there's not going to be - they're not going to be confounded by potential exposure to SARS. Chris, do you have anything to add to that? Yes, not really. I think the claims, if you're going to use the comparator method with a matrix that's not claimed, that's something that I think we have to have further discussion on.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA acknowledges the challenges posed by declining positivity rates and supports modifying protocols to include a combination of prospectively and retrospectively collected samples if challenges persist. They recommend considering international studies or proposing a method involving multiple serology test comparators for validation.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is there an issue if a trial protocol for a serology test is modified mid-trial to include half of the samples collected prospectively and the other half retrospectively?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, the clinical study. So, no, this is a - it is a challenging area, and with declining positivity rates, which we've depended on previously, the molecular comparative results fortrues, and then, you know, looking at time after molecular positivity. As the positivity rates fall, as vaccination and natural infection rates rise, this becomes more of a challenge to do the clinical study validation for serology tests. So if you're - if you've tried prospectively collecting samples, and you're having trouble, then consider international studies that I alluded to, or I discussed earlier on the call, where infection rates are higher, if that's useful. Eventually, though, we know that we will have to - we will - you know, it will be important for us to move forward in some situations with an EUA or other fully authorized serology test comparator situation.

#### 8. Clinical Study Data Requirements for Antigen Testing Approval

QA Block 8-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Do we still need to provide a rationale or justification for how data from clinical studies conducted outside the US is representative of the US population?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA requires an explanation, rather than a strict justification, on how clinical study data from outside the US closely applies to the US population, including appropriate settings, users, and language considerations.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Do we still need to provide a rationale or justification for how data from clinical studies conducted outside the US is representative of the US population?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We want to know, because you have a choice of selecting where you go to do the clinical study to collect positives and intervening negatives in that study. We just want to know the setting and the user is as close to the US user as possible. So, if it's a point of care test, the setting should be in a truly point of care setting, and not a central lab setting trying to mimic the point of care. And the users we expect are going to be non-laboratory end users. They're going to be, you know, healthcare workers likely, but not trained laboratorians. And the instructions we need to be in English. And if English is not their native language, that's okay, as long as they can understand English. But we don't want test developers to be providing them with some language other than English or Spanish in the instructions. So, and it's only if you provide English and Spanish, obviously English is prominent, but if you also have a Spanish language in your point of care testing and you want to use that in the US, that's fine.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the requirements for ensuring clinical study settings and users are as close as possible to the US user for point of care tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA requires that point of care test studies be conducted in authentic point of care settings with non-laboratory healthcare workers as users. Instructions should be in English, or Spanish if applicable, to reflect the US population. The settings, users, and language used must closely align with actual US conditions.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the requirements for ensuring clinical study settings and users are as close as possible to the US user for point of care tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We want to know, because you have a choice of selecting where you go to do the clinical study to collect positives and intervening negatives in that study. We just want to know the setting and the user is as close to the US user as possible. So, if it's a point of care test, the setting should be in a truly point of care setting, and not a central lab setting trying to mimic the point of care. And the users we expect are going to be non-laboratory end users. They're going to be, you know, healthcare workers likely, but not trained laboratorians. And the instructions we need to be in English. And if English is not their native language, that's okay, as long as they can understand English. But we don't want test developers to be providing them with some language other than English or Spanish in the instructions. So, and it's only if you provide English and Spanish, obviously English is prominent, but if you also have a Spanish language in your point of care testing and you want to use that in the US, that's fine.

#### 9. Defining High Throughput and Manufacturing Capacity for Serology Tests

QA Block 9-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the definition of high throughput in terms of the number of samples per day for serology tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: High throughput serology testing refers to tests prioritized to increase emergency response capacity, mainly in central labs handling complex testing. Currently, manual thresholds are not disclosed, but automation improves throughput.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the definition of high throughput in terms of the number of samples per day for serology tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We do also have criteria for high manufacturing capability. So, all of this is aimed at prioritizing at this point in the pandemic, those test reviews for EUAs that will substantially increase our emergency response capability. And low throughput central lab tests, or low manufacturing capacity of any test, is simply not going to substantially add to our response capability in the US. And we can't justify it given all of our other healthcare IVD priorities right now, as I talked previously about putting non-COVID files on pause, putting non-COVID - some - many non-COVID pre-subs on pause just because of capacity. Again, it all comes down to benefit-risk. If we dropped everything and looked at absolutely every SARS test, and we didn't look at the new stuff, then cancer patients and other infectious disease patients would suffer. And we've constantly, in this world, are trying to balance things for public health purposes. We've authorized almost 400 unique tests across serology, antigen and molecular. And there is a – substantial, already a substantial capacity. EUA provision is still open, though, and the FDA has flexibility to say what they're - what is currently of need for the public health emergency.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Should we work with the laboratory or the comparator device to further enrich data, e.g., in LOD or standard curve studies on a specific device and thermocycler, or rely on the IFU of the original manufacturer?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA has not authorized truly quantitative molecular tests due to variability in respiratory sample collection and transport, making such tests unreliable compared to blood-based samples. The FDA does not see a clinical need for quantitative tests but remains open to future possibilities.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Should we work with the laboratory or the comparator device to further enrich data, e.g., in LOD or standard curve studies on a specific device and thermocycler, or rely on the IFU of the original manufacturer?
VERBATIM ANSWER: You know, we haven't authorized any truly quantitative molecular test. We're not seeing a clinical need because - and there have been multiple non- FDA opinions, professional guidance that has stated that even if you have what's really quantitative molecular tests, there is huge variability in sample collection and sample transport that exists with respiratory samples, that doesn't exist for other truly quantitative molecular results like for HIV, HPV, HCV, CMV, where it's typically immuno blood-based sample which is well mixed in the human body, and gives us truly quantitative results that we can rely on in making treatment decisions. Are they responding to therapy or are they not? And they developed - potentially developed a mutation in HIV. That's currently embedded in current therapy. So, respiratory samples are just challenging. We're not encouraging the development of truly quantitative molecular tests, because we are not aware of the clinical situation, or this really would require that.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What constitutes a balanced viral load in clinical studies for antigen test submissions?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA ensures a balanced viral load in clinical studies by using CT values to confirm a natural range of viral loads rather than only high viral loads, accounting for variability such as sample collection issues.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What constitutes a balanced viral load in clinical studies for antigen test submissions?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We use CT values for antigen and molecular test reviews, to make sure that there's sort of a balanced viral load in the clinical study. And it's not all at the very high level of viral load, which is not typically a natural spread of results in a prospectively collected study. You know, and it's our way of ensuring that we see a full range of expected viral loads for the time period looked at, and we see very low - very high CT, very low virus amount sometimes, and even in the early days. Most likely, that's related to sample collection and not actual patients.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Why does the FDA not encourage the development of truly quantitative molecular tests for respiratory samples?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA does not encourage the development of truly quantitative molecular tests for respiratory samples due to the high variability in sample collection and transport, which impacts reliability. Unlike blood-based samples, respiratory samples are less consistent, and there is no clear clinical need driving this requirement. The FDA remains open to new evidence but does not currently support this development.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What criteria determine high manufacturing capability for a COVID-19 test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: High manufacturing capability means the ability to produce tests in high volumes to substantially contribute to the national COVID-19 response, in a way that justifies FDA's emergency prioritization.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What criteria determine high manufacturing capability for a COVID-19 test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: High throughput only pertains to central lab tests, those tests used in high complexity and your moderately complex labs. We do also have criteria for high manufacturing capability. So, all of this is aimed at prioritizing at this point in the pandemic, those test reviews for EUAs that will substantially increase our emergency response capability. And low throughput central lab tests, or low manufacturing capacity of any test, is simply not going to substantially add to our response capability in the US. And we can't justify it given all of our other healthcare IVD priorities right now. Point of care test or home test, those aren't high throughput tests. But we expect that they're able to be manufactured at this point in the pandemic in high volumes, so that the review time and everybody's time involved in developing and reviewing this test, is worthwhile and really adds to our national capacity for COVID.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: Manual tests may theoretically qualify for high throughput, but automation is generally preferred. FDA has not announced specific thresholds defining high throughput.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are manual tests capable of being classified as high throughput?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So we - yes. So we look at the particular test, and then automation for high throughput obviously helps. It's much harder to do high throughput manually, but there is a possibility of manual tests in high throughput. And our - we have not currently announced those thresholds that we use and which, you know, at some point in the future when we think things have settled down, and are somewhat more routine that we may announce those thresholds. Once we do, they're kind of fixed. It's hard for us to adjust them as the pandemic proceeds. And we would - we still want that flexibility to adjust as current needs, you know, need to be met, and looking at our overall workload.
