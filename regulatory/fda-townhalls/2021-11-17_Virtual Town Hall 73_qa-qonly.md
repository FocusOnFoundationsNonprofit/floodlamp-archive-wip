#### 1. Updates on COVID-19 Test Guidance and Priorities

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: When submitting an EUA request, what specific details should be included for tests that were offered under the previous notification policies?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA generally expects COVID-19 tests previously offered without an EUA to obtain one before further distribution. Developers must submit EUA requests within outlined timelines, and tests not authorized must cease marketing within 15 days of notification.
VERBATIM QUESTION: When submitting an EUA request, what specific details should be included for tests that were offered under the previous notification policies?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The Section IV.C of the guidance talks about distribution and offering of tests during FDA review. This is probably the largest section of the guidance, and the one that folks who have been operating under the notification policies previously are likely to be very interested in. So as everyone knows, the previous policies included the previous versions of our FDA guidance that had the notification policies, as well as the HHS August 2020 announcement, which, among other things, talked about LDTs for SARS-CoV-2 being offered without FDA authorization. So under the updated policy, we generally expect COVID-19 tests to have been issued an EUA for a marketing authorization prior to the tests being distributed or offered. This goes along with HHS withdrawing their August 2020 policy. And as the guidance outlines, we are ending the notification policies going forward. We do generally intend to review EUA requests for tests that were offered without an EUA request previously. And we have outlined timelines for which we intend for developers to submit those EUA requests. And then if a test is not subsequently authorized, we expect developers to cease marketing the test within 15 calendar days of being notified that we will not be authorizing their test.

#### 10. Pathways for OTC Antigen Test Authorization and Claims

QA Block 10-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How does including symptomatic population suffice for the all comers aspect?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA provided two possible paths: testing symptomatic individuals only with a post-market commitment to validate asymptomatic serial testing, or pursuing a full asymptomatic claim requiring pre-market data. Testing symptomatics only is the fastest route to market.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How does including symptomatic population suffice for the all comers aspect?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So there are two clear pathways for OTC. One is to only test symptomatic individuals. And if your performance meets the criteria for the serial testing plan, you don't have to do any more pre-market clinical studies. And there is just a post-market commitment to validate your serial testing in the asymptomatic population. If you want to go for a single test claim for asymptomatic screening, then, yes, we do need to see data on asymptomatics. But the fastest way to market is to do symptomatics only, meet the performance criteria, get the authorization, and then agree to the serial testing plan.

REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 10-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Would following the first-symptomatic claim route for OTC require a post-authorization condition for asymptomatic screening without asymptomatic data, followed by completing studies on asymptomatic population?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA stated two pathways for OTC claims: testing only symptomatic individuals requires no more pre-market studies but a post-market commitment for validating asymptomatic serial testing. For single test claims for asymptomatic screening, data on asymptomatics is required. The fastest route is to test symptomatics, meet performance criteria, and proceed with post-authorization steps.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Would following the first-symptomatic claim route for OTC require a post-authorization condition for asymptomatic screening without asymptomatic data, followed by completing studies on asymptomatic population?

But the fastest way to market is to do symptomatics only, meet the performance criteria, get the authorization, and then agree to the serial testing plan. I mean, antigen tests, typically, if you're going to get the maximum benefit from that-- and there are now a number of these-- it is important to do that serial screening because, if not, you are going to be less sensitive than a molecular test. And this applies to early in the infection. We have data that says that you become molecular positive before you become antigen positive, and in many cases when the antigen test at that time is negative. And obviously, if the antigen test is positive, that's fine. But when the antigen test is negative early on in the infection, it's going to lead somebody to think that they're negative when they're just about to spike in their viral loads and viral production, and will most certainly be infectious, so.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Why is serial testing important for antigen tests to maintain sensitivity compared to molecular tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Serial testing is crucial for antigen tests because it enhances sensitivity compared to molecular tests, particularly early in infections when molecular tests detect positive results before antigen tests do. Without serial screening, negative antigen test results may mislead individuals who are about to become highly infectious.
