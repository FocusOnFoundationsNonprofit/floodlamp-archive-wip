#### 1. FDA Updates on COVID-19 Testing Authorization

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What updates were made to the FAQ website to improve navigation and usability for users?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA updated its FAQ website by restructuring it into separate pages and sections for easier navigation and maintenance. Clarifying edits and new information were also added.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What updates were made to the FAQ website to improve navigation and usability for users?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So my update today is, you may have seen an email announcement that went out on Monday, regarding the FAQ website. I know a lot of you use that site regularly. And we did update it to restructure the entire page. So it looks quite different than it did before. The page had become fairly cumbersome to use with so much content that it became difficult to find what you're looking for. And it also became difficult for our web staff to maintain. So we've updated it to break it out into separate pages for the different sections of questions. And to break the question down into sections that hopefully makes them a little easier to find what you're looking for. And if you do find that it is difficult to use, or you have thoughts on ways to make it easier to use, please send those and we're always looking for feedback on that. And hopefully you'll find the information to be easier to navigate and to be useful. And we did also update a few questions while we did the restructuring and added some new information and mostly made some clarifying edits to questions that we had heard were a little bit confusing. Hopefully, that's helpful.

QA Block 1-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the requirements for obtaining an EUA for a self-testing COVID-19 test at home?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA authorized the first self-testing COVID-19 test for at-home use. It is prescription-based, swab, and molecular-based with 94% sensitivity. FDA is open to over-the-counter tests but has not yet received complete data for such EUAs.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the requirements for obtaining an EUA for a self-testing COVID-19 test at home?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The FDA has authorized the first COVID-19 test for self-testing at home. This is an entirely self-contained test. And it doesn't require a separate instance. Single use device. And it's a swab based test, molecular based test. And it's pretty good. About 94% PPA or sensitivity in that population. So it is by prescription. And so we had heard from a number of developers that they might seek the first home test through the prescription pathway as Jeff Shuren and I wrote in September and as I've mentioned multiple times, we are open to over the counter availability of testing, OTC for short. Both on the home collection side and on the home testing side. As far as I know, the last time I checked, that we have not received any EUAs with complete data for a home test that is over the counter.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Self-testing COVID-19 EUA requirements, Home testing authorization, Prescription and OTC pathways
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-5
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What distinguishes an over-the-counter home test from a prescription-based home test in terms of authorization requirements?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA has not yet received any complete data submissions for over-the-counter home COVID-19 tests but anticipates authorizing them in the future.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What distinguishes an over-the-counter home test from a prescription-based home test in terms of authorization requirements?
VERBATIM ANSWER: As far as I know, the last time I checked, that we have not received any EUAs with complete data for a home test that is over the counter. We look forward to authorizing the first over the counter home test. I think that's going to happen. I can't say exactly when that's going to happen.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Over-the-counter vs. prescription tests, Authorization for home tests
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-7

TOPICS: EUA submissions, Over-the-counter home tests
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-8
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the steps required to transition from an EUA-authorized test to a fully authorized test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The transition involves submitting the first test through the de novo pathway, with special controls and feedback outlining expectations. Subsequent submissions will go through the 510k pathway. Draft guidance with timelines and directions is being developed.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the steps required to transition from an EUA-authorized test to a fully authorized test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: For all SARS-related tests, that pathway will likely, if not in all cases, be through the de novo pathway for the first submission. And then subsequent submissions after that first grant of de novo will be through the 510k pathway. Once we grant that first de novo, there will be special controls written. These are instructions for developers to follow in order to fall within that pathway regulation. Special controls and feedback will outline expectations. Guidance is being drafted to provide timelines and additional directions.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: EUA to full authorization, de novo and 510k pathways, special controls
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-9
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How does the de novo pathway differ from the 510(k) pathway when authorizing fully approved tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The de novo pathway applies to the first submission and establishes special controls for subsequent applications. After the first grant of de novo, subsequent submissions use the 510(k) pathway, which does not require the de novo fee.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How does the de novo pathway differ from the 510(k) pathway when authorizing fully approved tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: For all the SARs related test, that pathway will likely, if not in all cases, be through the de novo pathway for the first submission. And then subsequent submissions after that first grant of de novo will be through the 510k pathway. And we'll work with -- if we get multiple submissions for de novos, we'll work with developers to authorize as soon as we can. But just so you know, not all - only the first submission is the one that is required to pay the de novo fee and we'll work with all others after that. And it's something that we've handled before prior to the pandemic. So once we grant that first de novo, there will be special controls written. These are special -- these are instructions for developers to follow in order to fall within the grant - that pathway, that newly created pathway regulation.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: De novo pathway, 510(k) pathway, FDA test authorization process
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-10
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the cost implications for developers submitting under the de novo pathway?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Only the first submission under the de novo pathway for SARS-related tests requires payment of the de novo fee. Subsequent submissions will follow the 510(k) pathway without requiring the fee.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the cost implications for developers submitting under the de novo pathway?
VERBATIM ANSWER: For all the SARs related test, that pathway will likely, if not in all cases, be through the de novo pathway for the first submission. And then subsequent submissions after that first grant of de novo will be through the 510k pathway. And we'll work with -- if we get multiple submissions for de novos, we'll work with developers to authorize as soon as we can.

SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: de novo pathway costs, FDA submission fees, test authorization process
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-11
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are special controls, and how do they guide developers transitioning from EUA to full authorization?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Special controls are instructions written once the first de novo is granted, guiding developers on expectations to meet the new regulatory pathway, aligned with FDA's thinking and feedback.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are special controls, and how do they guide developers transitioning from EUA to full authorization?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Once we grant that first de novo, there will be special controls written. These are special -- these are instructions for developers to follow in order to fall within the grant - that pathway, that newly created pathway regulation. To tell developers that this is what we expect to see. And obviously that's going to be in line with our thinking and interactive review that we share with developers, so that anyone who has submitted a de novo, will get that feedback from this.

TOPICS: Special controls, EUA to full authorization, De novo pathway
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-12
CLARIFIED QUESTION: When does the FDA anticipate issuing draft guidance on the transition from EUA to full authorization for COVID-19 tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is drafting guidance on transitioning COVID-19 tests from EUA to full authorization, but there is no timeline available for its release as of now.
VERBATIM QUESTION: When does the FDA anticipate issuing draft guidance on the transition from EUA to full authorization for COVID-19 tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The current thought is that guidance is being drafted by OPEQ and the center that will cover diagnostics. And as soon as we can make that draft available we will. I can't promise when that will be available. But obviously we're thinking about this and thinking about how to provide developers with more directions.

VERBATIM QUESTION: What timelines is the FDA considering for different diagnostics technologies to transition from EUA to full authorization?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The current thought is that guidance is being drafted by OPEQ and the center that will cover diagnostics. And as soon as we can make that draft available we will. I can't promise when that will be available. But obviously we're thinking about this and thinking about how to provide developers with more directions. We're also - that will have important timeline. And we want to establish timelines for each of the technologies and the types of devices that makes sense. We hope that you feel that as well. We are really looking to support all COVID, really, developers through this process so that everybody has good chance to get through that conversion. And the timelines aren't too short. So stay tuned on that. I can't promise again when that draft guidance will be issued, but as soon as we can, we will.

SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: EUA to full authorization, Conversion timelines for diagnostics, FDA guidance draft timelines
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-14
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How can developers determine if their application aligns with prior authorizations for similar tests, including for respiratory viruses or serology tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Developers should review prior authorizations for similar tests, such as respiratory virus panel tests, individual molecular tests, or serology tests, with a focus on those processed through the 510(k) pathway.
VERBATIM QUESTION: IMPLICIT
VERBATIM ANSWER: But a good guide would be, you know, what we've done for similar tests in the past. That will cover the vast bulk of questions, you know, is to look through previous authorization for respiratory viruses in recent ones, especially for and this is for 510k most of the time, for panel tests, for individual molecular tests, and the panel test could be antigen or molecular. And also for serology tests.

#### 8. Evaluating Antigen Test Sensitivity for Asymptomatic COVID-19 Cases

QA Block 8-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: If someone submits an EUA for a public health antigen test designed to detect contagious individuals and they can show 90% sensitivity with high viral load in symptomatics, should we conclude the test also has 90% sensitivity for high viral load asymptomatics?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA cannot automatically conclude 90% sensitivity for high viral load asymptomatics based on symptomatic data due to differences in observed sensitivities and regulatory challenges. Asymptomatic test sensitivity varies, and mitigation measures like healthcare involvement are considered during reviews.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If someone submits an EUA for a public health antigen test designed to detect contagious individuals and they can show 90% sensitivity with high viral load in symptomatics, should we conclude the test also has 90% sensitivity for high viral load asymptomatics?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Some of the preprints I've seen maybe the same ones that you're referring to show about an 80% sensitivity of a particular brand - a decent brand, I think, that has about an 80% sensitivity relative to PCR. And in symptomatic population and the different studies varied a little bit on the asymptomatic sensitivity, but it was in that 30 to 40% range. So I don't know the preprints that you're referring to. The challenge for us is that we want to ensure that there's good accurate testing available. What matters in our current reviews is the performance and the first five days minimally of symptoms or the equivalent period. And so this does present a regulatory challenge when it comes to how do we study the asymptomatic population. But I will say that we're aware of numerous data that have shown that in the symptomatic population, that CTs can be extremely high. You know, well above 30 and above 35, in the first five days of symptoms. And so to simply use a cycle thresholds to restrict the data would, you know, in the symptomatic population, withhold data that is important for us to look at. So why that is? This has been repeated through numerous data sets that I have been able to access. And why that is? I'm still trying to understand. Could it be the biology? Could it be the sampling? How good the sampling is? How good the swab is? How good the saliva collection is? Whatever it might be. That is a challenge for us, because we're assuming, I think with good reason, that the first five days of symptoms, somebody is contagious. That consistent in the data too and the fact that you have the variability by CT adds quite a challenge for our reviews. So we're, you know, we can authorize a test, that in the asymptomatic population, has a lower sensitivity, you know, if there's mitigation. So one of those mitigations is that a health care worker is involved, so it's by prescription.

QA Block 8-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Could this mean we may consider dropping the requirement for asymptomatic data?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is aware of challenges in studying asymptomatic populations. For asymptomatic screening the agency mandates returning results through a CLIA lab, and mitigation strategies could include requiring prescriptions or healthcare worker involvement. Surveillance testing not returning individual results is outside FDA regulation.

VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, I know what you're saying. I think the CDC has a great paper on cautions against the CT values. And I've read that paper obviously.

#### 9. FDA Guidance on Swab Types for Diagnostic Testing

QA Block 9-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the FDA view swabs collected from the mid-turbinate area and the nasal pharyngeal area as being collected from the same anatomical site since both are from nasal sites?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA considers both mid-turbinate and nasal pharyngeal swabs acceptable alternatives, depending on study requirements. Mid-turbinate swabs may replace nasal pharyngeal swabs in certain situations, but sponsors determine the swabs used.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA view swabs collected from the mid-turbinate area and the nasal pharyngeal area as being collected from the same anatomical site since both are from nasal sites?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So, we would be transparent in however the sponsor, the developer did the study whether it's the nasal pharyngeal or mid- turbinate. But you may be asking can you replace, where we might recommend, or ideally in a nasal pharyngeal swab may be used, would we allow a midturbinate swab? Yes. So, you know, we - that would be an acceptable alternative for where we want - typically would want a nasal pharyngeal swab. There may be a direct sort of study you're thinking about. But the one area that I remember currently where we want to see a good swab and not a nasal swab, not an anterior nasal swab, is when we evaluate saliva or fluid base test. We still want to see preferably a nasal pharyngeal swab, but if it's difficult, we have been allowing mid-turbinate swabs to be used. But in many other applications, we don't require either a mid-turbinate or a nasal pharyngeal swab. That's up to the sponsor.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: If we are making an over-the-counter (OTC) use claim for a test, and the youngest age claimed is 14 years old, does this mean younger children cannot perform a nasal swab by themselves even if coached?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA evaluates age-related self-collection based on submitted data. If younger children cannot adequately self-collect, data must show an adult in the home can swab them effectively for authorization.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If we are making an over-the-counter (OTC) use claim for a test, and the youngest age claimed is 14 years old, does this mean younger children cannot perform a nasal swab by themselves even if coached?
VERBATIM ANSWER: But I'll say in general - and I don't know of anything that's not acceptable about this first home test, but in general, we make decisions based on data, of course, if not in all cases. So we definitely have allowed children to be tested. And we allow an adult present to swab in clinical studies and to support an authorization. I will say, though, you know, if a developer has not shown that an adult in the home can adequately swab a child in the home, then we wouldn't have data to make an assessment about whether or not that can be authorized because there is an age and this is, you know, we have pediatrician on our staff. There's an age at which we're just not sure if somebody can accurately self- collect and run a test uniquely so. But as far as the collection part of the home test, if a developer comes in with data that shows an adult can swab a child, then we'll - and the data looked good, obviously, then we will authorize that as well, whether it's OTC or prescription, it doesn't really matter.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Do we need to submit information if we want to show that the test works with both nasal swabs and buccal swabs?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Okay, until you asked about the buccal swab, I was thinking molecular and then I was thinking antigen to molecular and so the buccal swab would obviously be a new sample type and would need to be validated by you and performance acceptable for us to authorize for an antigen test.

#### 12. Home Test Reporting and Mobile App Integration

QA Block 12-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How will the reporting of results from home testing into surveillance efforts and to providers in care planning occur?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA does not require legal reporting from home testing outside a CLIA lab, but developers are encouraged to propose reporting solutions. The FDA supports initiatives like app development to facilitate consumer reporting of results to public health platforms.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How will the reporting of results from home testing into surveillance efforts and to providers in care planning occur?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So as far as requirements for reporting from home testing, that is not within a CLIA lab and it is my understanding that there is not the legal requirement to report. There might be, you know, a public health service sort of bent to wanting to make sure that those results get reported. But I would refer you to CMS, who are the ones that get the final word on those reports required for reporting or the CDC. And so as a result, we asked for home tests. We ask developers to please give us, you know, your thoughts about how you might make it possible to report those results. But we don't make it a review requirement that there be something in place. We just think that it's something that's a responsible thing to do is to find a way. Now, of course on Monday, this week, there was an app design-athon for reporting COVID results publicly announced by the department and other entities within the US government. And we're hoping that those applications, that are developed, will allow any developer sort of connect up with an even home test use situations where a consumer could use an app to report their results.

QA Block 11-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How should we address validating a new sample type, such as buccal swabs, for an antigen test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: To validate a new sample type like buccal swabs for an antigen test, you need to provide performance data that meets FDA authorization standards.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How should we address validating a new sample type, such as buccal swabs, for an antigen test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The buccal swab would obviously be a new sample type and would need to be validated by you and performance acceptable for us to authorize for an antigen test. And the same thing goes for a molecular.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Franco Calderon
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Sample type validation, Buccal swabs, Antigen tests
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 11-9
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the necessary validation requirements to support authorization for new sample types like buccal swabs in antigen tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Buccal swabs are considered a new sample type for antigen tests and require validation by the developer to demonstrate acceptable performance for FDA authorization.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the necessary validation requirements to support authorization for new sample types like buccal swabs in antigen tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Okay, until you asked about the buccal swab, I was thinking molecular and then I was thinking antigen to molecular and so the buccal swab would obviously be a new sample type and would need to be validated by you and performance acceptable for us to authorize for an antigen test. And the same thing goes for a molecular.
