#### 1. FDA Updates on COVID-19 Testing and Authorization Guidelines

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can authorized diagnostic tests, both antigen and molecular, be used off-label for asymptomatic testing?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Authorized antigen and molecular diagnostic tests can be used off-label for asymptomatic testing. This is allowed and encouraged by the FDA as long as it's directed by the prescriber.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can authorized diagnostic tests, both antigen and molecular, be used off-label for asymptomatic testing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The FDA is allowing tests, diagnostic tests to be used, antigen and molecular tests that are authorized, to be used off label in testing asymptomatic patients. So that is completely legitimate to do. We're encouraging it because we only have a small number of tests right now that are authorized for asymptomatic screening. So off label use as directed by the prescriber for prescription tests is completely acceptable and encouraged.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Off-label use of diagnostic tests, Asymptomatic testing, FDA guidance
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What criteria should prescribers consider when interpreting positive results from off-label use of diagnostic tests in asymptomatic populations?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Prescribers should understand that off-label use of authorized tests for asymptomatic populations is acceptable. They should account for actual performance data, virus spread in the region, and consider confirmatory tests, preferably a high-sensitivity molecular test, if needed. Alternative antigen tests may also be explored, but molecular tests are preferred to minimize false negatives.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What criteria should prescribers consider when interpreting positive results from off-label use of diagnostic tests in asymptomatic populations?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The FDA is allowing tests, diagnostic tests to be used, antigen and molecular tests that are authorized, to be used off label in testing asymptomatic patients. So off label use as directed by the prescriber for prescription tests is completely acceptable and encouraged. In particular, direct antigen tests, it's, you know, that have been authorized, all of them that have been authorized can be used for this purpose. The only - there is a rare - there are rare examples where we've seen asymptomatic data that is not sufficient for authorization. And we make a very rare and unusual statement in the IFU, in the instructions for use. Otherwise, we just categorically say that all the authorized tests for direct antigen testing, can be used off label by prescription in the asymptomatic population. Again, the, you know, we don't know the actual performance and that should, you know, be understood by the prescribers. But we, you know, if there's something that's positive then that's great. But even in that situation, you want to make sure and look at, you know, the spread of the virus in that particular area. If the incidents of positive results is low then it's important to strongly consider a confirmatory test. We typically say use a high sensitivity molecular test. Hopefully you have arrangements that you can get that result back in 24 to 48 hours. That would be ideal obviously. You know, another antigen - different antigen test potential could be used as well. You know, whatever you have access to that's important to be sure and confirm that result. But again, I think the highest sensitivity molecular test. A different antigen test may have slightly lower performance than a centralized high sensitivity molecular test and could return potentially a false negative on the repeat testing. So all that should be taken into account.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Off-label testing criteria, Diagnostic test interpretation, Confirmatory testing
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the recommended confirmatory tests if there is a low prevalence of positive results using asymptomatic testing?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends using a high sensitivity molecular test as the confirmatory test when the prevalence of positive results from asymptomatic testing is low, ideally with results available in 24-48 hours. Alternatively, a different antigen test could also be considered based on what is accessible.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the recommended confirmatory tests if there is a low prevalence of positive results using asymptomatic testing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: If the incidents of positive results is low then it's important to strongly consider a confirmatory test. We typically say use a high sensitivity molecular test. Hopefully you have arrangements that you can get that result back in 24 to 48 hours. That would be ideal obviously. You know, another antigen - different antigen test potential could be used as well. You know, whatever you have access to that's important to be sure and confirm that result. But again, I think the highest sensitivity molecular test.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: How does the FDA encourage submissions for asymptomatic claims, and what data would be helpful?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is actively encouraging submissions for asymptomatic claims and welcomes them. Federal roadblocks have been removed by CMS and HHS, and FDA supports deployment of related testing. Developers can contact FDA via email for further assistance.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How does the FDA encourage submissions for asymptomatic claims, and what data would be helpful?
VERBATIM ANSWER: As I said, we are looking and encouraging more and more submissions for asymptomatic claims for screening plans and we welcome those. But in the interim, we've made this very clear and CMS and HHS have made this very clear as well. They have removed any potential roadblocks at the federal level. If there's anything else that we can do to assist in deploying the test in that manner if you have questions, please email us at the template email address and we'll do our very best.

QA Block 1-6
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Will the new town hall format ensure all questions from test developers are addressed, and what changes should developers expect?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Starting next year, FDA will adjust town halls to ensure test developers' questions are addressed. Changes may include topic-focused weeks, allowing all questions by the end of sessions.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Will the new town hall format ensure all questions from test developers are addressed, and what changes should developers expect?
VERBATIM ANSWER: I did want to also state that starting in the new year, we will continue these town halls. Look for announcements. We will try something a little bit different in the new year. I want to make sure that those developers of antigen and molecular point of care tests and home tests, have the ability to get their questions asked and potentially answered, to the best of my ability and our abilities. You know, there's typically a number of callers and sometimes we don't know if callers don't get their questions answered. So we are looking at different ways of doing this. I anticipate that after - we may do this by topic alternating weeks. And - but I anticipate that in all cases, by the end of the hour, we will accept all questions. So that I just want to sort of make sure that every different development group out there gets a chance to ask some key questions so that we can clarify, explain, stimulate, encourage all test development.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: New town hall format, Test developers' questions, Process changes
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-7
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the FDA's strategy for authorizing home-based over-the-counter diagnostic tests, including serology tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is excited about authorizing home-based OTC diagnostic tests, including the first antigen test. They aim to authorize more tests, including antigen, molecular, and serology, balancing high manufacturing capacity and cost.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the FDA's strategy for authorizing home-based over-the-counter diagnostic tests, including serology tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Of note is one very important authorization and that was an antigen - it happened to be an antigen test. But it is an antigen test that has been authorized as the first home based over the counter test. And so we are extremely excited about that here at the agency. And look forward to more and more home testing authorizations, not just for antigen tests; not just for ­ and molecular, but also for serology tests as well. And of course, we had a prior prescription based molecular test and we look forward to more authorizations both by prescription and OTC in the home. Of course, you know, molecular is great if it can be done in the home environment. There is a challenge though in that it is more difficult to manufacture molecular tests in quite the same volume as direct antigen lateral flow tests. And that - and also there may be cost differentials too. But because of the manufacturing capacity of these so-called paper strip tests or lateral flow tests, the authorization yesterday for the first home OTC test is - was such a paper strip test. It - those - the capacity of making those tests is in the potentially tens of millions per month, if not even to the 100 million mark, even from a single manufacturer.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Home-based OTC tests, Serology test authorization, Diagnostic test expansion
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-8
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the challenges associated with manufacturing molecular tests for the home environment, and how do they compare to antigen lateral flow tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Manufacturing molecular tests for home use is challenging due to lower production volumes and potentially higher costs compared to antigen lateral flow tests. Lateral flow tests, like paper strip tests, can be manufactured in massive quantities more efficiently and cost-effectively.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the challenges associated with manufacturing molecular tests for the home environment, and how do they compare to antigen lateral flow tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Molecular is great if it can be done in the home environment. There is a challenge though in that it is more difficult to manufacture molecular tests in quite the same volume as direct antigen lateral flow tests. And that - and also there may be cost differentials too. But because of the manufacturing capacity of these so-called paper strip tests or lateral flow tests, the authorization yesterday for the first home OTC test is - was such a paper strip test.

SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Molecular test challenges, Antigen lateral flow tests, Home testing manufacturing
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-9
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How does the FDA evaluate the credibility and performance of new home-based OTC diagnostic tests under the EUA framework?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA evaluates OTC diagnostic tests by authorizing them under the EUA framework after assessing initial performance data, manufacturing capacity, and their ability to provide accurate results for the intended purpose.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How does the FDA evaluate the credibility and performance of new home-based OTC diagnostic tests under the EUA framework?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Of note is one very important authorization and that was an antigen - it happened to be an antigen test. But it is an antigen test that has been authorized as the first home based over the counter test. And so we are extremely excited about that here at the agency. And look forward to more and more home testing authorizations, not just for antigen tests; not just for ­ and molecular, but also for serology tests as well.

It - those - the capacity of making those tests is in the potentially tens of millions per month, if not even to the 100 million mark, even from a single manufacturer. So obviously, deploying such testing that has been EUA authorized, by which we've had a chance to look at the test and authorize it and get a good initial feel at least under the EUA framework, of its performance, so that the public can - and users of these tests can have assurances that the FDA believes they are accurate for the intended purpose.

#### 2. Over-the-Counter COVID Test Reporting Challenges and Solutions

QA Block 2-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Do you expect all over-the-counter COVID-19 tests to have the capability to generate reports of test results and send them to public health authorities?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA strongly encourages all test developers to incorporate reporting features, as it is critical for tracking virus trends, but it is not a requirement for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
VERBATIM QUESTION: Do you expect all over-the-counter COVID-19 tests to have the capability to generate reports of test results and send them to public health authorities?
VERBATIM ANSWER: In regards to reporting, it's obviously strongly encouraged that developers of all tests consider that, in particular, point of care tests and home tests where it's maybe a little bit more challenging because it's not being done in a moderate or a high complexity lab which has established or it's easier at least, relatively easier for them. Not that it's easy. Relatively easy for those labs to have reporting features to the public health authorities. It's obviously, you know, critical that the US government has; public health authorities have data on where virus is going up and where virus is going down. We are constantly looking at the effectiveness of programs and testing and that's just one good measure of how the program, the amount of testing in areas is being - whether it's being effective or not. And the more we have that sort of information in real time the faster we can make assessments of the importance. And so while it's not what I would call a decision requirement for an EUA, we encourage it. We encourage developers to think about this.

REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 2-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: If an over-the-counter test does not have a corresponding app, how would you expect the reporting to public health authorities to happen?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA strongly encourages test developers to consider reporting features, particularly for home or point-of-care tests. While not required for EUA, developers are often asked to develop reporting plans as part of post-market commitments. The FDA supports initiatives like the design-a-thon to create standardized apps for reporting.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If an over-the-counter test does not have a corresponding app, how would you expect the reporting to public health authorities to happen?
VERBATIM ANSWER: In regards to reporting, it's obviously strongly encouraged that developers of all tests consider that, in particular, point of care tests and home tests where it's maybe a little bit more challenging because it's not being done in a moderate or a high complexity lab which has established or it's easier at least, relatively easier for them.

And so while it's not what I would call a decision requirement for an EUA, we encourage it. We encourage developers to think about this. We look forward to those developers who don't have one at authorization. I believe the first home test was that situation and we asked them as part of a post-market commitment, to come up with a plan to be able to provide home users, in that case it was RX, and/or their prescribers to be able to report that information back. There is a, you know, US government app-a-thon that has just concluded. The goal of that app-a-thon is to identify reporting technologies that could be used not just for a specific test but - I'm sorry, it's called a design-a-thon, not just for a particular test but that's fine for developers to do that and proprietary reporting is fine. But to find designs and apps and reporting functions that can be used independent of the tests performed, so that this is - this eases the desire we have for all developers to make some sort of reporting feature available. If a given, particularly a small developer of a test who doesn't have the full capabilities to really think about this, than having a, you know, off the shelf app that could be used for them, that would be awesome.

#### 3. FDA Guidance on Comparator Tests and Retrospective Samples

QA Block 3-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the comparator PCR test for a lateral flow antigen test need to be collected using a nasopharyngeal swab, or is an anterior nasal or mid-turbinate swab sufficient?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The comparator PCR test can use an anterior nasal swab as long as the molecular test is authorized for that swab type. FDA recommends using tests as labeled and advises consulting them to confirm the appropriateness of the comparator.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the comparator PCR test for a lateral flow antigen test need to be collected using a nasopharyngeal swab, or is an anterior nasal or mid-turbinate swab sufficient?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Well it can be as long as the molecular test is authorized for an anterior nasal swab. So we don't - we prefer - recommend that you use tests that are used on label. Also, we do recommend that you check with us about the comparator method, to make sure that we believe it's a good comparator. We have asked for the comparator to be a high sensitivity molecular test that uses an extraction procedure to concentrate the virus.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Wendy Strongen
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Comparator PCR test, Swab type, FDA recommendation
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 3-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Do you prefer that we directly contact the FDA to check about specific comparator tests rather than using a possible list?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends contacting them directly to verify comparator information as no recommended list is currently available. While some data is public, decisions on comparators may involve unpublished information.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Do you prefer that we directly contact the FDA to check about specific comparator tests rather than using a possible list?
VERBATIM ANSWER: I don't believe we've posted a recommended list. We have the results that have been posted already for the RNA reference panel testing. We do use that testing in part, to assess whether it's a comparator. And we try to - the reference data is important. Some - reference data for some tests have not yet been posted. But we have that information. And if you were to, you know, want to use that molecular test there'd be no reason not to. But you don't - you - it's not visible to the public what the RNA - what the reference panel results are. So you wouldn't necessarily know. So there could be molecular tests not on that list for example. We tend to want to look at, you know, the more sensitive tests. So you can look at that list and look at the relative analytical sensitivities and then double check with us. That would be great. Okay?

QA Block 3-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can we limit retrospective samples for validation to PCR values below a certain CT threshold, such as CT 29?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA is open to using retrospective samples but recommends direct swabs, ideally fresh. Adjustments like limiting to CT 29 values should be discussed with the FDA before validation.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can we limit retrospective samples for validation to PCR values below a certain CT threshold, such as CT 29?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So, you know, we certainly understand that it's in some ways, easier to get these bank samples and sometimes they're not ideal for - especially for direct antigen tests where you'd want to use a direct swab. So we are open to the use of those samples but - and we understand that it could put your device at a relative disadvantage by using them. We look for and recommend actual data and actual samples so there have been some direct antigen tests that have included say UTM, VTM in their authorizations, at least initially. The first antigen test was that way. And their sensitivity in that substrate, was enough to - for us to go ahead and authorize. So that's our recommendation. If you are going to propose something different than that, you know, I would recommend that you come in and seek, you know, our concurrence before you actually spend money and do the study. We'll endeavor to get back to you as soon as possible given that point of care tests are a priority. But wherever possible, it is our recommendation that actual direct swabs be used.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can we present a calculated CT value adjusted for a dilutional effect in remnant samples versus how they would actually be run?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA understands the use of diluted or remnant samples but prefers actual direct swabs. If proposing an alternative like presenting calculated CT values for diluted samples, FDA recommends seeking concurrence to avoid potential issues.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can we present a calculated CT value adjusted for a dilutional effect in remnant samples versus how they would actually be run?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So, you know, we certainly understand that it's in some ways, easier to get these bank samples and sometimes they're not ideal for - especially for direct antigen tests where you'd want to use a direct swab. So we are open to the use of those samples but - and we understand that it could put your device at a relative disadvantage by using them. We look for and recommend actual data and actual samples so there have been some direct antigen tests that have included say UTM, VTM in their authorizations, at least initially. The first antigen test was that way. And their sensitivity in that substrate, was enough to - for us to go ahead and authorize. So that's our recommendation. If you are going to propose something different than that, you know, I would recommend that you come in and seek, you know, our concurrence before you actually spend money and do the study. We'll endeavor to get back to you as soon as possible given that point of care tests are a priority. But wherever possible, it is our recommendation that actual direct swabs be used. They can be frozen direct swabs if there are banks out there that use - that have been banking frozen direct swabs for an antigen test for example, or for molecular tests that want to use. We'll accept that as supplements for fresh samples but we have some evidence that freezing could actually increase the sensitive of testing, surprisingly enough. And we don't want to limit an authorization to any test that says you have to freeze a sample before you test. That wouldn't make any sense.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What criteria must the FDA consider when determining whether a molecular test is a good comparator?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA requires the comparator to be a molecular test authorized for the sample type used, such as an anterior nasal swab. The test should also have high sensitivity and use an extraction procedure to concentrate the virus.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What criteria must the FDA consider when determining whether a molecular test is a good comparator?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Well it can be as long as the molecular test is authorized for an anterior nasal swab. So we don't - we prefer - recommend that you use tests that are used on label. Also, we do recommend that you check with us about the comparator method, to make sure that we believe it's a good comparator.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA has not posted a recommended list of comparator molecular tests but uses RNA reference panel results to assess comparators. They encourage contacting them directly for guidance if needed.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA provide guidance on acceptable comparator molecular tests other than consulting their RNA reference panel results?
VERBATIM ANSWER: I don't believe we've posted a recommended list. We have the results that have been posted already for the RNA reference panel testing. We do use that testing in part, to assess whether it's a comparator. And we try to - the reference data is important. Some - reference data for some tests have not yet been posted. But we have that information. And if you were to, you know, want to use that molecular test there'd be no reason not to. But you don't - you - it's not visible to the public what the RNA - what the reference panel results are. So you wouldn't necessarily know. So there could be molecular tests not on that list for example. We tend to want to look at, you know, the more sensitive tests. So you can look at that list and look at the relative analytical sensitivities and then double check with us. That would be great. Okay?

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Why is there flexibility in allowing only five fresh positive samples for point-of-care testing in pre-market submissions?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA allows flexibility to use five fresh positive samples pre-market instead of the recommended 30 to begin evaluating performance on fresh samples. All negative samples should still be sufficient.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Why is there flexibility in allowing only five fresh positive samples for point-of-care testing in pre-market submissions?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So for point of care studies, home studies, we want to see samples as they would be used in real life.

#### 8. Mitigating Sensitivity Shortfalls Through Serial Testing Strategies

QA Block 8-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is using two tests from different manufacturers the only serial testing mechanism to address potential sensitivity shortfalls in home or point-of-care testing, or could timing of serial tests using the same assay also be used?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is open to serial testing mitigations to address sensitivity shortfalls, including using the same assay on a set schedule, such as tests on day one and day three. They also accept orthogonal testing with pre-authorization data to validate sensitivity thresholds.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is using two tests from different manufacturers the only serial testing mechanism to address potential sensitivity shortfalls in home or point-of-care testing, or could timing of serial tests using the same assay also be used?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So as Dr. Shuren and I announced in our - the Hill piece in September, we are open to tests that fall below the recommended sensitivity if there are mitigations. One mitigation is serial testing. If that's something that you want to pursue you would do a study with the particular serial testing format that you want to follow with your device. I'm lost a little bit on the orthogonal. I think that was confirmation post- authorization for actual use of an authorized test in low prevalent populations, where you might discover an asymptomatic positive and you want to know if it's a true positive. Then we're asking for an orthogonal method. We're recommending an orthogonal method that's post-authorization. That's just normal clinical use. If you were to take molecular antigen results in a low incidence population, a positive as absolute truth, that potentially can have untoward consequences. And we're recommending, the CDC recommends that you test with an orthogonal. But pre-market for authorization purposes, the serial testing suggestion recommendation is one way to mitigate a test that on a single test say, single test result in a given person, may not meet the recommended bars that we have for authorization. And by testing on a set schedule, you know, say it's every day, every other day, every - you know, every day, every once, you know, day one/day three, day one/day four, day one/day five depending on whatever serial testing program you'll want to have for your device, it would be with your device, to bring that sensitivity level up to our recommended level, that's - we're totally open with that. There are potential other mitigations. You mentioned orthogonal tests. That can be useful in the tests that orthogonal method has to be authorized for the setting in which you are going to deploy that. And we want you to come in with data that shows that whatever testing schemes, serial testing schemes, orthogonal testing schemes you want to use, in order to mitigate a lower sensitivity, we're open to that. We just want to see the data. And we would authorize based on the data and sort of the study design that was used. So if you came in and you say we tested with our tests, you know, two tests - one from day one, one from day three combined with sensitivity that our threshold, recommended threshold for sensibility for point of care, or a home test, then that's how we would authorize it. We would say okay, this test is authorized if you perform it on day one and day three. And this is how you interpret the results. So hopefully that's helpful.

#### 10. Comparator Selection for Nasal Swab Clinical Validation Studies

QA Block 10-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: If an assay is being developed for anterior nasal nares samples, does the comparator test need to be done with NP swabs or can it also use anterior nasal nares samples?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA allows developers to choose a comparator test authorized for anterior nasal nares or NP samples, but using the same sample type for both comparator and test may provide better results.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If an assay is being developed for anterior nasal nares samples, does the comparator test need to be done with NP swabs or can it also use anterior nasal nares samples?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So I think it - the question earlier was a little bit different. They were asking if they could use an anterior nasal sample for the comparator test. It's just much more well-tolerated and they can enroll patients more easily than if they were to require an NP swab. Of course, if somebody - a developer wants to use an NP swab for the comparator test and an anterior nasal swab for their test, that's fine. I would caution that that could be putting your test at a disadvantage because the NP swab may be more sensitive than the anterior nasal swab. If you want to use a comparator that is only authorized for an NP swab and you want to use that comparator, then whatever anatomic site you're looking for, you know, as far as doing the clinical study, your finding is the NP swab. I mean that's the preferred swab for all of our work. I was just giving flexibility to this developer and other developers, if their molecular comparator is authorized for anterior nasal and NP. They can choose whatever authorized swab for the comparator testing, that they want.

VERBATIM ANSWER: If you want to use a comparator that is only authorized for an NP swab and you want to use that comparator, then whatever anatomic site you're looking for, you know, as far as doing the clinical study, your finding is the NP swab. I mean that's the preferred swab for all of our work. I was just giving flexibility to this developer and other developers, if their molecular comparator is authorized for anterior nasal and NP. They can choose whatever authorized swab for the comparator testing, that they want. And so it, you know, but if the test is coming in only for NP swab which is probably, you know, unlikely these days, in order to show the best concordance, you want to probably use the same anatomic site; you'd want to do NP to NP.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is there a disadvantage to using anterior nasal swabs as a comparator instead of NP swabs due to differences in sensitivity?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Using anterior nasal swabs as a comparator instead of NP swabs may disadvantage a test due to the higher sensitivity of NP swabs, which are the FDA's preferred swab choice.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is there a disadvantage to using anterior nasal swabs as a comparator instead of NP swabs due to differences in sensitivity?
VERBATIM ANSWER: I would caution that that could be putting your test at a disadvantage because the NP swab may be more sensitive than the anterior nasal swab. If you want to use a comparator that is only authorized for an NP swab and you want to use that comparator, then whatever anatomic site you're looking for, you know, as far as doing the clinical study, your finding is the NP swab.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What should developers consider when choosing a comparator test to ensure fair evaluation of their diagnostic test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Developers should ensure the same anatomic site is used for both their test and the comparator test for optimal concordance. While the FDA allows flexibility, using the NP swab, the preferred sample type, can minimize disadvantages and ensure fair evaluation.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What should developers consider when choosing a comparator test to ensure fair evaluation of their diagnostic test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: If somebody - a developer wants to use an NP swab for the comparator test and an anterior nasal swab for their test, that's fine. I would caution that that could be putting your test at a disadvantage because the NP swab may be more sensitive than the anterior nasal swab. If you want to use a comparator that is only authorized for an NP swab and you want to use that comparator, then whatever anatomic site you're looking for, you know, as far as doing the clinical study, your finding is the NP swab.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Why does the FDA recommend mid-turbinate swabs as the minimum standard for comparator tests involving saliva or fluid samples?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends mid-turbinate swabs as the minimum standard for saliva or fluid comparator tests because they are less intrusive than NP swabs while meeting testing requirements.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Why does the FDA recommend mid-turbinate swabs as the minimum standard for comparator tests involving saliva or fluid samples?
VERBATIM ANSWER: There is one subset of tests where we are asking for either an NP swab or a mid-turbinate swab. And again, it has to be - the comparator test has to be authorized for one or the other of them. And that is for saliva or fluid. We still are asking and recommending that the comparator swab bet at least a mid-turbinate swab and - which is much more tolerable than an NP swab.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the FDA provide feedback or recommendations related to mutations in the population that may affect test performance?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA scans mutation data linked to the US monthly and flags concerns, reaching out to developers if mutations may affect test performance. They recommend developers survey mutations and conduct inclusivity and cross-reactivity testing.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA provide feedback or recommendations related to mutations in the population that may affect test performance?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Our office, on a monthly basis, is looking at the database of mutations, at least that are linked to the US. We are - since we have those primary and probe sequences, our bio-pharmaticians are scanning the mutation data and flagging anything that could be of concern. We have already initiated reaching out to some developers. And we are, you know, in dialog with them. If there is something that is existent that would potentially lower the performance of the test we will work with those developers in every situation and make that information public as soon as possible. We probably are looking at communicating this program more formally in the not too distant future. So we are doing this as a service. It's not something that we normally do. But in this pandemic we feel it's important. We would encourage all developers, of course when a molecular developer say comes in with primary probe sequences, we are asking for both inclusivity testing even if in only in silico as well as cross-reactivity testing at least in silico for some things. But we do really want that test developer's post authorization to be surveying. We would encourage them and recommend to them that they survey indication standards and for any prevalent mutations that might exist in the population at least for the US, that might affect the performance in their assay. So more to come on that later.

VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the recommended number of fresh positive samples for point-of-care testing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: For point of care studies, home studies, we want to see samples as they would be used in real life. The flexibility that we're allowing is to - five fresh positives is not meeting our recommended number of fresh positives for point of care testing. What - the flexibility is, is that only five of the recommended fresh positives and, you know, getting fresh negatives is pretty easy. There's no reason not to have fresh positives in - fresh negatives in sufficient numbers to meet our recommendations. But if the positives that have say, our recommendation is 30 fresh positives that are requiring all of those - recommending all of those pre-market and pre­ market for authorization or allowing just five positives, not just five fresh samples, it's five positive samples, until we get a read on the performance on fresh samples.

QA Block 10-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: For saliva or fluid tests, why is a mid-turbinate or NP swab required as the comparator?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: For saliva or fluid tests, FDA requires a comparator test to use either an NP or mid-turbinate swab since these provide reliable performance data, with mid-turbinate swabs being more tolerable.
VERBATIM QUESTION: For saliva or fluid tests, why is a mid-turbinate or NP swab required as the comparator?
VERBATIM ANSWER: There is one subset of tests where we are asking for either an NP swab or a mid-turbinate swab. And again, it has to be - the comparator test has to be authorized for one or the other of them. And that is for saliva or fluid. We still are asking and recommending that the comparator swab bet at least a mid- turbinate swab and - which is much more tolerable than an NP swab.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can anterior nasal swabs be used as a comparator for new diagnostic tests if the target sample type for the test is also anterior nasal?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Anterior nasal swabs can be used as a comparator if the comparator test is authorized for anterior nasal samples or both anterior nasal and NP. However, NP swabs may be more sensitive and using mismatched sites could disadvantage the test. Ideally, comparator testing should use the same sample type.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can anterior nasal swabs be used as a comparator for new diagnostic tests if the target sample type for the test is also anterior nasal?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So I think it - the question earlier was a little bit different. They were asking if they could use an anterior nasal sample for the comparator test. It's just much more well-tolerated and they can enroll patients more easily than if they were to require an NP swab. Of course, if somebody - a developer wants to use an NP swab for the comparator test and an anterior nasal swab for their test, that's fine. I would caution that that could be putting your test at a disadvantage because the NP swab may be more sensitive than the anterior nasal swab. If you want to use a comparator that is only authorized for an NP swab and you want to use that comparator, then whatever anatomic site you're looking for, you know, as far as doing the clinical study, your finding is the NP swab. I mean that's the preferred swab for all of our work. I was just giving flexibility to this developer and other developers, if their molecular comparator is authorized for anterior nasal and NP. They can choose whatever authorized swab for the comparator testing, that they want. And so it, you know, but if the test is coming in only for NP swab which is probably, you know, unlikely these days, in order to show the best concordance, you want to probably use the same anatomic site; you'd want to do NP to NP.

QA Block 12-5
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can oral fluid or saliva be used as a comparator for validation purposes?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA does not recommend using saliva or oral fluid as a comparator for validation purposes. Instead, a mid-turbinate or nasal pharyngeal swab is preferred, even if saliva has already been authorized.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can oral fluid or saliva be used as a comparator for validation purposes?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. We're not recommending that saliva be used or oral fluid be used, as a comparator for the opposite. We're not recommending that. We're recommending a mid-turbinate or a nasal pharyngeal even if you already have saliva authorized. We've seen some quite variable data with oral fluid and saliva. And so for that, those particular claims for those that come in for EUA authorization, that's what we're asking for.
