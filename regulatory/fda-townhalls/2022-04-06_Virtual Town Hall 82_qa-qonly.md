CLARIFIED ANSWER: Developers should reference the master file number provided in the FAQ for leveraging the Emory validation data.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How should developers reference the master file when using the Emory validation data?
VERBATIM ANSWER: On the last Town Hall, we mentioned this study conducted by Emory and the Children's Healthcare‐‐ Children's Hospital of Atlanta that looked at the validation data to support pediatric self‐swabbing. So as promised on the last Town Hall, we have added an FAQ that includes this information and the master file number is included in the FAQ at that link. So any developer that's looking to leverage the data from this study can do so by referencing that master file number.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: Emory validation data, Master file reference, Pediatric self-swabbing
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the FDA's plan for handling tests authorized under EUA if the public health emergency declaration expires?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA will not take actions that would leave the public without necessary tests if the public health emergency expires. EUAs are governed under section 564 of the FD&C Act, not the public health emergency declaration under section 319. Even if the public health emergency declaration expires, the EUA declaration remains active until terminated by the HHS Secretary. A 180-day transition period has been proposed and more information is available in the draft guidance.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the FDA's plan for handling tests authorized under EUA if the public health emergency declaration expires?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We've gotten a lot of questions on this Town Hall and in other venues regarding what happens to tests that are offered under EUA if the public health emergency expires and is not renewed. So we've talked about that a little bit on this call before, and we did post this FAQ to help with that ongoing question. Essentially as we've talked about on this call, we definitely don't plan to take any action that would leave the American public without the tests that they need. And we recognize the need for an appropriate transition period. It's also important to note, as we've talked about here before, the distinction between the public health emergency determination under section 319 of the Public Health Service Act, and the separate declaration under section 564 of the FD&C Act. And it's that second one that enables the issuance of EUAs. So the public health emergency declaration for COVID‐19 was issued on January 31 of 2020, and has been extended every three months since then. The public health declaration‐‐ public health emergency declaration can expire if it's not extended. However, the EUA declaration under section 564 does not expire, and it is not dependent on the extension of the public health emergency declaration. The declaration‐‐ the EUA declaration under section 564 continues until the HHS Secretary terminates it. And many of the previous EUA declarations such as formers, Zika and Ebola, remain in effect, especially for in vitro diagnostic tests.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: EUAs and public health emergency, Transition after emergency expiration, FDA regulatory guidance
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the differences between the public health emergency declaration under section 319 of the Public Health Service Act and the EUA declaration under section 564 of the FD&C Act?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The public health emergency declaration under section 319 can expire if not extended and is renewed every three months. In contrast, the EUA declaration under section 564 does not depend on the public health emergency and remains in effect until terminated by the HHS Secretary.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the differences between the public health emergency declaration under section 319 of the Public Health Service Act and the EUA declaration under section 564 of the FD&C Act?
VERBATIM ANSWER: It's also important to note, as we've talked about here before, the distinction between the public health emergency determination under section 319 of the Public Health Service Act, and the separate declaration under section 564 of the FD&C Act.

The declaration‐‐ the EUA declaration under section 564 continues until the HHS Secretary terminates it.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: Public Health Emergency, EUA Declaration, Regulatory Differences
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-5
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How long after the public health emergency declaration expires will developers have to transition their tests under EUAs?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA has proposed at least a 180-day transition period after the public health emergency ends, but EUAs are not tied to the emergency and continue until the HHS Secretary terminates them.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How long after the public health emergency declaration expires will developers have to transition their tests under EUAs?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The public health emergency declaration for COVID‐19 was issued on January 31 of 2020, and has been extended every three months since then. The public health declaration‐‐ public health emergency declaration can expire if it's not extended. However, the EUA declaration under section 564 does not expire, and it is not dependent on the extension of the public health emergency declaration. The declaration‐‐ the EUA declaration under section 564 continues until the HHS Secretary terminates it. And many of the previous EUA declarations such as formers, Zika and Ebola, remain in effect, especially for in vitro diagnostic tests. So there's additional information on the website, including discussion about the transition guidance that we've talked about on the Town Hall before, which has been issued in draft, and that guidance proposes that there will be at least a 180‐day transition period. And the FDA will finalize that guidance once we review the public comments on the draft.

QA Block 1-8
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the process for handling test-specific or detailed case-specific inquiries that are unsuitable for discussion during Town Hall meetings?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA responds to detailed or case-specific inquiries by email, usually within a few days. Questions that are too specific for the Town Hall should be directed to the templates email box or handled through a pre‐EUA submission.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the process for handling test-specific or detailed case-specific inquiries that are unsuitable for discussion during Town Hall meetings?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We have received some questions that are a little too detailed or test or case specific to respond to on this call. And if we have not already responded by email, we will do so within a few days. And then we also continue to receive a lot of similar inquiries that some of them are appropriate for the Town Hall and we try to address them in the introductory remarks, such as the two topics that I just covered. And then other ones are really not able to be addressed on this call because they are too specific. For example, we continue to receive numerous questions about which EUA molecular comparator is acceptable, and we welcome those inquiries at the templates email box CDRH‐EUA­ Templates@fda.hhs.gov. And we also receive numerous questions about enrollment strategies and specifics of clinical study designs. And those really are best handled through a pre‐EUA submission.

#### 2. Checking Authorization and Safety of COVID-19 Tests

QA Block 2-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How can we check which COVID-19 tests have been cleared or authorized by the FDA?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA authorized COVID-19 tests are listed on the FDA website, including a specific page for at-home, over-the-counter tests. Links can also typically be found in webinar slides.
VERBATIM QUESTION: there have been several COVID‐19 test recalls recently for tests that were not FDA authorized, how can we check which COVID‐19 tests have been cleared or authorized by the FDA?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So all FDA authorized tests are listed on the FDA web page. The slides for this webinar, typically include the link to the listing of EUAs. And so you can find that on the slides that are posted from these webinars, and also, I think probably everyone on this call is familiar at this point with where on our website the EUAs are posted. We also have a risk specifically of FDA authorized at‐home, over the counter COVID‐19 diagnostic tests that can be found at the FDA's at‐home, OTC COVID‐19 diagnostic tests web page.

#### 3. Managing Bias in OTC Antigen Test Studies

QA Block 3-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is it necessary to exclude study subjects with prior use of OTC antigen tests in an OTC study?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA does not require excluding individuals with prior OTC test experience but stresses eliminating bias during candidate test studies, advising pre-EUA reviews where necessary.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is it necessary to exclude study subjects with prior use of OTC antigen tests in an OTC study?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah, thanks for this question, and you rightly point out a potential source of bias, and also rightly point out that it's hard to imagine someone in the country who hasn't had their nose swabbed or that there's that many people that don't know how to run home test now. We're not looking to exclude those folks. What we are looking to do is eliminate bias at the time‐‐ introduce bias at the time that the candidate test is being studied. And so if‐‐ depending on how you're doing your study, there are potential sources of bias. There's also recruitment bias and enrichment bias. So any time there's potential bias, we do recommend that you run your study and your selection enrollment and enrichment criteria bias‐‐if you're going to try to do that, first, in a pre‐EUA way, in order to review and make sure that bias is eliminated or mitigated. But in general, we would like when possible for the test subject to perform the candidate test first, and then the comparator test result. A sample will be obtained by whatever method you're looking to do.
SPEAKER QUESTION: James Mullally
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Study subject inclusion, Bias elimination, OTC antigen study design
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 3-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is the FDA accepting of studies where subjects have limited prior home-use experience with antigen tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA does not require excluding individuals with prior home-use antigen test experience but emphasizes eliminating bias during testing. Bias mitigation strategies should be reviewed in a pre-EUA submission.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is the FDA accepting of studies where subjects have limited prior home-use experience with antigen tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah, thanks for this question, and you rightly point out a potential source of bias, and also rightly point out that it's hard to imagine someone in the country who hasn't had their nose swabbed or that there's that many people that don't know how to run home test now. We're not looking to exclude those folks. What we are looking to do is eliminate bias at the time‐‐  introduce bias at the time that the candidate test is being studied.

REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 3-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How can a study be designed such that the candidate test is used before the standard of care test when standard procedures suggest conducting the clinical truth or standard of care test first?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA generally recommends performing the candidate test first but does not require it. Study designers could test the standard of care first, then proceed to the candidate test, or use randomization. Local IRBs can help determine the best approach.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How can a study be designed such that the candidate test is used before the standard of care test when standard procedures suggest conducting the clinical truth or standard of care test first?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah, that is our general recommendations. It's not a requirement. I think we depend on local IRBs and the submitter and the study designer to figure that one out. But if‐‐ so there's a couple of possibilities. There's the test of record is one of the tests we would allow as a comparator or it's not and you have another comparator. And so I would say, if it's important to do the test of record first, get that out of the way, then move into the clinical study domain, and then do the candidate test first, or you can randomize as well. So that is an option for use here. And so it's unfortunately not something‐‐ because there's different options here that we can only prescribe, and we wouldn't really recommend exactly how to do this because there's different ways to do this that are OK.
SPEAKER QUESTION: James Mullally
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Study design, Candidate test sequencing, Standard of care
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 3-5
CLARIFIED QUESTION: If the comparator test swab is collected deeper into the nasal canal than the candidate test swab, would it be acceptable to collect the comparator test first since the collection methods differ?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: If the comparator swab goes deeper (e.g., mid-turbinate) and interferes less with an anterior nasal swab, FDA prefers the candidate swab to be done first. However, if both tests use similar (e.g., anterior nares) methods, this can be avoided.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If the comparator test swab is collected deeper into the nasal canal than the candidate test swab, would it be acceptable to collect the comparator test first since the collection methods differ?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah, well if that's the case, then that does‐‐ there's less potential interference with an anterior nasal swab. But if the comparator's different, the comparator is mid‐turbinate and the candidate devices and anterior nares and it's different than the test of record then, I think we'd prefer you did the candidate test swab first. But also remember that if the candidate test is an anterior nares swab, you can use a comparator test that uses an anterior nares swab.
SPEAKER QUESTION: James Mullally
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Comparator vs. candidate test swabs, Collection order, Swab interference
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 3-6
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the potential sources of bias that the FDA prioritizes for elimination in OTC test studies?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA aims to eliminate biases like recruitment and enrichment bias, especially during candidate test studies, and recommends reviewing such measures first in a pre-EUA submission.

#### 4. Evaluating Sensitivity and Limitations of Rapid Antigen Tests

QA Block 4-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can you explain the differences between PPA higher or equal to 80% and PPA lower than 95% for rapid antigen diagnostic tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: For rapid antigen tests, a PPA of 80% or above is sufficient for authorization as long as other validation conditions are met. If PPA is below 95% but above 80%, the test is still authorizable but must include a disclaimer stating negative results are presumed negative. Tests with PPA above 95%, generally molecular lab tests, do not require this disclaimer.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can you explain the differences between PPA higher or equal to 80% and PPA lower than 95% for rapid antigen diagnostic tests?

#### 7. Internal Controls in Molecular vs. Antigen-Based Home Tests

QA Block 7-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Why do nucleic acid-based home tests have a sample internal quality control incorporated while enzyme immunoassays do not?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: It is easier for molecular assays to include internal controls for sample adequacy, whereas this is more challenging for antigen tests. Antigen tests have not yet advanced to the same level. However, internal controls may not always be required for molecular tests if their sensitivity and processes are validated post-market.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Why do nucleic acid-based home tests have a sample internal quality control incorporated while enzyme immunoassays do not?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The simple answer is that it's relatively simple for molecular assays to incorporate an internal control to make sure that an adequate sample is obtained or it's much more challenging for an antigen test to provide such a control. And so that's where the state of the art is for molecular tests and the antigen tests haven't gotten there yet. That said, there have been circumstances where we have enough data, usually post market data, where we've removed the requirement for molecular‐‐ say in a home collection, to have an internal control just because they have done so many tests showing that the internal control that their processes and procedures and their assay was so sensitive enough that the internal control didn't add anything. So that's our general thinking about this, Kris. I don't know if you have anything to add about that.

SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Internal quality controls, Nucleic acid vs antigen tests, Post-market evaluation
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 7-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is it obligatory now for nucleic acid tests to have an internal sample quality control?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Molecular tests often include an internal control due to ease of incorporation and ensure adequate sample quality; however, for antigen tests, it is more challenging. In some cases, FDA has waived the requirement for molecular tests if sufficient post-market data demonstrates reliability without it.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is it obligatory now for nucleic acid tests to have an internal sample quality control?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The simple answer is that it's relatively simple for molecular assays to incorporate an internal control to make sure that an adequate sample is obtained or it's much more challenging for an antigen test to provide such a control. And so that's where the state of the art is for molecular tests and the antigen tests haven't gotten there yet.

#### 11. Transitioning EUAs to 510k for Molecular Diagnostics

QA Block 11-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Will a prospective clinical evaluation study meeting 510k criteria, conducted to support an EUA, be acceptable for a 510k application if it used an EUA assay as the comparator?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: A prospective clinical evaluation that meets 510k criteria and supports an EUA can be used for a 510k application, but FDA recommends different comparator methods for 510k (e.g., three methods to confirm true positives). FDA encourages leveraging existing data and engaging them through a pre-submission process to clarify requirements.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Will a prospective clinical evaluation study meeting 510k criteria, conducted to support an EUA, be acceptable for a 510k application if it used an EUA assay as the comparator?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So if you've got prospective data already for your EUA, that's something that is mentioned in the special controls for molecular tests for SARS‐CoV‐2, which are‐‐ were promulgated last year. Our recommendations for the comparator method are a little bit different in the EUA world versus the 510k. In EUA, I think we take a single EUA comparator method, 510k will take, I think we're recommending three methods to make sure that those positives are really true positives. But like Tim mentioned, we do want to make sure we're leveraging as much data as possible. So I think that's the right path forward would be letting us know what your plans are, what your existing data set consists of, and then asking that question in a pre‐sub and we'll be glad to answer it in that format.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What specific details are needed in a pre-submission to support the transition from an EUA to a 510(k)?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA indicated that if prospective clinical data were generated under the EUA, these should align with the special controls for molecular SARS‐CoV‐2 tests. Comparators may differ; 510(k) submissions require data validated with three comparator methods, unlike EUAs which may use just one. Pre-submissions are recommended to clarify and align data requirements.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends leveraging as much prospective EUA submission data as possible when transitioning to a 510(k). Prospective data for EUA that aligns with 510(k) criteria may be utilized, but the comparator method criteria differ between EUA and 510(k). Submitting a pre-submission is advisable to clarify data requirements and plans.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How does the FDA recommend maximizing the use of EUA submission data when transitioning to a 510(k)?
VERBATIM ANSWER: But we are looking to fill the gap between EUA and full authorization to make maximum use of the EUA submission data.

#### 12. Strategies for Obtaining Flu Samples for Antigen Testing

QA Block 12-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What strategies would the FDA recommend to obtain the necessary five fresh flu A and B samples in the season to support a multi-analyte antigen test for an EUA?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA suggests discussing enrichment strategies for finding flu A and B samples directly with them and submitting a pre-EUA proposal for review and feedback. Using banked swab samples is a possibility, but these are limited and not widely available.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What strategies would the FDA recommend to obtain the necessary five fresh flu A and B samples in the season to support a multi-analyte antigen test for an EUA?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Antigen little bit more difficult. Yeah, an antigen a little bit more difficult because they usually use a direct swab and that's the best way to run those tests. So first of all, as I mentioned earlier in the session today, we are seeing in many areas rates of flu A positivity above SARS‐CoV‐2 positivity at the moment, which is unusual for the pandemic, but not necessarily surprising. It's a bit late for flu but you know everything's sort of helter skelter in this pandemic. But as far as enrichment strategies to try to do that, at the top of the hour our talk of the session, Toby did mention that if you want to discuss enrichment techniques to sort of find ways to find those samples, you can discuss that with us directly. And please propose something that we can in a pre‐EUA that we can review and comment on. But that's really the best way to handle this knowing that specificities of your device and what your current thinking is about how you're going to do that. One of the challenges as I mentioned earlier in this session is that there's almost no flu A‐‐ flu B here. So there is the possibility of using‐‐ if you have an antigen test, of using banked swab samples, but, unfortunately, there's banked flu A and B direct swabs are unlikely to be plentiful or available.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA actively monitors COVID-19 diagnostic tests for safety, adverse events, and unauthorized marketing, issuing recalls and safety notices to protect public health and ensure only accurate, FDA-authorized tests are used.
VERBATIM QUESTION: IMPLICIT
VERBATIM ANSWER: We do regularly monitor the safety and performance of COVID‐19 diagnostic tests, including reports of adverse events and performance issues, and also, the marketing of unauthorized, unapproved, or uncleared tests. And we issue safety communications to help educate test users, caregivers, health care providers, and generally the public to‐‐ and to help reduce the risk of false test results that could lead to serious illness and death. So only home tests that are authorized by the FDA should be used by the American public. And we take steps to remove unauthorized home tests or any inappropriately offered tests from the market and inform test users and the public, caregivers, health care providers, to avoid using those tests.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What was the FDA's initial stance on asymptomatic COVID-19 testing when no authorized tests were available?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Initially, when no authorized tests were available for asymptomatic COVID-19 screening, the FDA allowed labs to test and report asymptomatic samples, even if the tests they used lacked specific authorization.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What was the FDA's initial stance on asymptomatic COVID-19 testing when no authorized tests were available?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Early on when there were none yet that had come in and there was a need for asymptomatic screening, we made the decision that we didn't want labs to turn away samples that were asymptomatic that they should be tested and reported out, even if the test they were using didn't have an authorization for that.
