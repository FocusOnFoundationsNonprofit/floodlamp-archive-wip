#### 5. Distinguishing Pooling and Serial Testing Requirements for Authorization

QA Block 5-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is the pooling study post-marketing of the product with an extended intended use claim for pooling over n equals 3 related to the agency's relaxation of validation requirements for pooling studies?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Pooling and serial testing are separate; serial testing, required for added asymptomatic testing, mitigates risks and avoids pre-authorization validation for pooling with asymptomatic data, which must be validated post-authorization.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is the pooling study post-marketing of the product with an extended intended use claim for pooling over n equals 3 related to the agency's relaxation of validation requirements for pooling studies?
VERBATIM ANSWER: To clarify, pooling and serial testing are different indications. Pooling is combining multiple samples to test together, and serial testing is when you test the same individual multiple times over a period of days, such as every two days, every three days, or weekly. The supplemental EUA template adds serial testing to the indication as a risk mitigation given that the template provides a pathway to add asymptomatic testing without prior validation data in that population. Under that approach, since asymptomatic data would not be validated prior to authorization, we would expect asymptomatic testing to be validated post-authorization. And with the approach provided in that template, the serial testing is required as part of that indication to add cooling without the additional validation pre-authorization.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: pooling validation requirements, serial testing, asymptomatic testing
REVIEW FLAG: False

#### 6. Guidance on Clinical Study Setup and User Training

QA Block 6-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is it acceptable for a company's team to help with the initial setup of their clinical testing sites, such as preparing the clinical testing location and materials and answering questions from untrained operators before beginning a clinical study?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA generally does not allow companies to assist with setting up clinical testing sites for point-of-care studies because it would negate the study's purpose with untrained users. However, for high-complexity tests intended for trained users, training study personnel is appropriate, provided the same training is available to customers to ensure real-world performance consistency.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is it acceptable for a company's team to help with the initial setup of their clinical testing sites, such as preparing the clinical testing location and materials and answering questions from untrained operators before beginning a clinical study?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So for that the, answer is generally no. For point of care, the users should not be trained. So helping with that set up would sort of negate the fact that you're studying the device with untrained users. For high-complexity tests intended for use with trained users in a high-complexity laboratory, then it would be appropriate to provide training to study personnel, noting that any training that you provide to study personnel should also be available to your customers to ensure that the level of performance observed in your clinical study is reflective of performance in the real-world lab setting.

#### 8. Developing Variant-Specific Rapid Antigen Tests: Feasibility and Challenges

QA Block 8-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is there a need for developing a rapid antigen test specifically for the Delta strain or other strains of COVID-19?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA emphasizes the importance of detecting any strain of COVID-19, as the primary goal is identifying infection. Sequencing is currently the most effective method to determine specific strains. Antigen tests tailored to Delta or specific variants would need to be robust against mutations and require validation.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is there a need for developing a rapid antigen test specifically for the Delta strain or other strains of COVID-19?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So I can start on this one and then see if Kris wants to jump in. Generally, with the virus mutating, we want to make sure that any strain is detected. So detecting whether someone is infected or not is the primary goal. And then typically, sequencing is the most effective to determine what strain if that needs to be determined. Since if you created your test to detect specific mutations and then the virus continued to mutate, there would be additional ones that may not be caught by your test. Kris, do you want to add anything there? Sure. So evaluating test performance with respect to variants with molecular tests is pretty straightforward. We've got pretty good in silico tools and methods for wet testing-­ antigen tests are a little bit more nuanced. And so I think if you have a technology that is perhaps more robust to changes in the potential epitopes on the virus and you think you've got a technology to ensure the test performance is maintained in the face of emerging variants, and that's something we absolutely would like to engage on, claiming specifically for detection, specific detection of Delta or other variants is a slightly different claim. And that would have to be validated in that particular context. So I think those are maybe the two different routes you could consider.

These studies aim to ensure suitability for the test's intended population, especially in settings with untrained users. Requirements do not differ between point-of-care and home testing.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is it required to include a usability study of 30 patients for serial testing for point-of-care and 100 patients for home testing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So the usability study recommendations don't change for whether it's single-use testing or serial testing. The usability study requirements are-- or recommendations, rather-- are to make sure that the test can be used generally by the intended use population. The usability studies are done generally for home use for point-of-care. I'm trying to refresh my memory of what we have in the template for that. We definitely want to see that the test is suitable for use in a CLIA waved setting so that it's appropriate for use with untrained users. But the requirements for that do not change between single-sample testing or serial testing.

QA Block 12-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: If we submit the EUA package for point-of-care testing and submit the usability study data at the same time, would we get the EUA for point-of-care and a conditional EUA for serial testing until asymptomatic validation is complete?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The usability study is not the determining factor for obtaining serial testing. Reviewing the supplemental EUA template is required. Serial testing can be obtained for asymptomatic individuals using symptomatic validation data and template recommendations, separate from usability.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If we submit the EUA package for point-of-care testing and submit the usability study data at the same time, would we get the EUA for point-of-care and a conditional EUA for serial testing until asymptomatic validation is complete?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So again, the usability is not what would get you the serial testing. You would want to take a look at the supplemental EUA template for what we're recommending to get the serial testing indication. But yes, if you have validation in symptomatic individuals and you take a look at the recommendations in the supplemental template, then you could use that to get serial testing for asymptomatic individuals prior to having validation for asymptomatic-- again, separate from usability.
