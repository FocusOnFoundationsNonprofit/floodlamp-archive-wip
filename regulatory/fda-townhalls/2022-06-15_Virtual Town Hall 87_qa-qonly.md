#### 2. Evaluating Variants for OTC Rapid Antigen Test Authorization

QA Block 2-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does FDA have a recommended number of variants that should be evaluated to support the EUA authorization for an over-the-counter rapid antigen test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA does not have specific requirements but recommends developers evaluate relevant variants by assessing viral mutation prevalence in sequence databases like GISAID. Mutations with significant frequency (over 5% across 2,000 sequences within a recent timeframe) should be considered. More information is available in FDA's viral mutation guidance and FAQ portal.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does FDA have a recommended number of variants that should be evaluated to support the EUA authorization for an over-the-counter rapid antigen test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: No, we don't have specific requirements, but we do expect developers to evaluate the impact of all relevant variants. So for that, we recommend assessing the prevalence of viral mutations in sequence databases, such as the GISAID database, as mutations observed in these databases at a significant frequency may signify that the mutation is present in an increasing portion of infected individuals in the U.S. And generally, we consider a significant frequency to be greater than 5% when considering at least 2,000 sequences over a recent period of time, such as the past week, month, or quarter. We do have some additional information on evaluating the impact of viral mutations in our viral mutation guidance that was issued in 2021 and on our viral mutation webpage for COVID.

#### 8. Guidelines for Using Frozen Samples in Antigen Testing Studies

QA Block 8-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can we utilize SARS-CoV-2 clinical remnants procured during a multi-analyte clinical study and use these frozen remnants for future benchtop analytical studies?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Yes, using properly stored dry swabs is likely acceptable for benchtop analytical studies, but a freeze-thaw study and stability testing are required to assess performance impacts.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can we utilize SARS-CoV-2 clinical remnants procured during a multi-analyte clinical study and use these frozen remnants for future benchtop analytical studies?
VERBATIM ANSWER: OK, dry swabs. Good. So if your device takes direct swabs and these are swabs stored properly as direct swabs, so that's going to be something that is likely to be something that's acceptable. There's just a couple of things I would add and maybe Kris has additional things to add, and that is we would want to see a freeze thaw study for your method of collecting and storing these samples, so you would do a paired frozen and paired unfrozen. We have seen where freezing a sample for an antigen test can release perhaps more antigen and create greater sensitivity, so there could be a positive bias and sensitivity for frozen samples that we'd like to understand. And then also it's important for you to know the stability of those samples when stored frozen and for how long.

QA Block 8-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can this approach of using frozen remnants be acceptable for at-home tests that utilize an accompanying app?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Using frozen remnants for at-home test studies presents challenges in evaluating the full test protocol. Issues include workflow testing, handling biases, and potential viral exposure. FDA recommends submitting a pre-EUA for feedback or a Q-Submission for other pathways.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can this approach of using frozen remnants be acceptable for at-home tests that utilize an accompanying app?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So if you're talking about doing clinical studies for an over‐the‐counter test, that produces some challenges to being able to evaluate the full test protocol from the patient, opening the box, reading it, taking the swab, making sure it's done properly for an accurate result, and then yielding results. So the bias there is that it would only be‐‐ you'd be removing the reading bias from that situation. But if you hand them a swab where they don't know whether it's positive or negative, they're going to be unbiased in that respect, but you're not testing the full workflow of the assay, which is really important for an over‐the‐counter situation. We can‐‐ I think this is more easily dealt with in the point‐of‐care setting, and you also would be handing potential‐‐ or some of the swabs maybe half or more or less of positive patients swabs to health care workers instead of a home user. So there is the potential for exposure that would be of concern if you're handing a viral swab to a patient, to a home user.

But we have been putting into the conditions of authorization the commitment to develop such a reporting feature, whether that's the patient entering the results as positive or negative themselves or whether it's a device that determines whether the test is positive or negative and that somehow has connectivity. So we do have a team within the office that can assist in the best way for a given developer to develop such a tool. And so you can come in with a pre‐EUA. Or during your review, you can ask to connect with that group, and they can advise you on all the different options you might have and all of the work that the office and the U.S. government has done to make tools available to developers.

#### 12. Using Pseudo Virus for At-Home Antigen Test Studies

QA Block 12-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can we use a pseudo virus for a flex study since heat inactivated and gamma irradiated methods are not suitable for our product?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA has not accepted pseudo virus to date for analytical studies like flex studies, and instead recommends using a quantified patient sample, as it better reflects real-world conditions. Proposing pseudo virus would require addressing specific questions.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can we use a pseudo virus for a flex study since heat inactivated and gamma irradiated methods are not suitable for our product?
VERBATIM ANSWER: It's an interesting question. I think we might need to know more details like how much of the antigen target is produced in the pseudo virus, any characterization studies you have. Certainly you understand where you live virus BSL‐3 is not a good thing to do or an easy thing to do, and that if heat or radiation affects your detection of the antigen, that could be a challenge. So my recommendation would be to come in with a pre‐EUA way to describe that to see if it's acceptable. Kris, may have other thoughts and suggestions. Kris? Yeah, thanks. So we haven't accepted pseudo virus to date. What most folks have been using is a quantified patient sample. I think the previous caller was kind of alluding to that, and that's kind of‐‐ there's plenty of patient samples available. That's really the most reflective of what a patient sample is going to look like in the real world.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: How does the FDA recommend incorporating alternate-labeling requests into an approved Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends working with the test developer to include alternate labeling in their EUA submission, allowing FDA to consider its authorization to improve test accessibility.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How does the FDA recommend incorporating alternate-labeling requests into an approved Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Hey, this is Toby. I'll just add a little bit there. As Tim was talking about, the labeling generally does need to be authorized, and so we are, again, as Tim said, very interested in working with you to get additional, alternate labeling authorized to improve the accessibility for of tests for different communities. If there's a specific test that you're working with, working with that test developer to bring the new labeling in under their EUA would be really beneficial, so then we can consider authorization of the alternate labeling as part of their EUA.

#### 15. Sequencing Recommended Over RT-PCR for Variant Confirmation

QA Block 15-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can we use our RT-PCR kit that amplifies and recognizes omicron and delta as a way of confirming which are omicron and which are delta, as opposed to doing sequencing?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends using sequencing to distinguish between omicron and delta variants. Validating a non-sequencing-based assay would require more effort. If sequencing is not possible, contact the FDA for further guidance.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can we use our RT-PCR kit that amplifies and recognizes omicron and delta as a way of confirming which are omicron and which are delta, as opposed to doing sequencing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah, yeah, we would recommend sequencing because, otherwise, you would have to validate the non‐sequencing‐based assay for this purpose, and that would be a lot more work than just getting the samples sequenced. If you're having trouble getting sequencing information for every sample, that's something to reach out to the FDA to get some thoughts about how to do that or how to manage [AUDIO OUT] that situation. Kris, do you have anything else? No other than to reiterate sequencing is much preferred. If there's absolutely no chance of sequencing, again, reach out.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA is uncertain about the timeline for the EUA process ending but emphasizes that other pathways like de novo and 510(k) remain open. They are prioritizing transitioning EUA holders to full authorizations.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can you give us your latest guess on whether the EUA pathway will be available for the rest of the year or for a month?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah, we just don't know. We are coming up on‐‐ we are 2 and 1/2 years into this, and we've authorized well over 470 tests. And there will have to be an end sometime, end this effort, there has to be –a time when we say enough is enough. But I can't say when. But no matter what, the EUA authorities are not the only pathway to market in the United States. The regular full‐authorization pathways of de novo and 510ks, depending on the submission, are always completely over. They never‐‐ completely open. They never shut down as opportunities to get something to market the US. So I would just factor that in your thinking. At this time, we are still encouraging people who already have EUAs to come in for a full authorization. That's really our prime focus now is to get people to do that and assist people in doing that because we have authorized so many tests, and we want to make sure that those who are interested have an opportunity to come in for a full authorization.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Will a digital reader for lateral flow rapid antigen tests become a requirement for transitioning to a 510k?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: A digital reader is not required for transitioning to 510k, but it is preferred due to advantages like improving sensitivity, eliminating subjectivity in result interpretation, and facilitating result reporting. FDA suggests submitting a Pre-Submission to discuss a digital reader approach.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Will a digital reader for lateral flow rapid antigen tests become a requirement for transitioning to a 510k?
VERBATIM ANSWER: A digital reader is not required for transitioning to a 510k. However, there are multiple advantages of using a digital reader, so it is generally preferred over a visual readout. Digital readers may allow for additional enrichment strategies in the clinical study, may streamline result reporting, improved test performance by potentially increasing sensitivity, and eliminate subjectivity in result interpretation. There are several FDA‐cleared rapid lateral flow tests currently on the market for flu and other analytes that use a digital reader, and it's likely that a similar device design would be acceptable for a SARS‐CoV‐2 antigen test de novo or 510k.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the FDA's view on researchers creating easy-to-read bilingual versions of COVID-19 test instructions for use (IFUs)?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA encourages both English and Spanish instructions for use, but other languages require careful testing and coordination with the FDA. A pre‐EUA submission is recommended for new language translations. IRB studies with consent offer more flexibility but cannot serve as the clinical test of record. FDA is interested in collaborating to improve accessibility through alternate labeling.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the FDA's view on researchers creating easy-to-read bilingual versions of COVID-19 test instructions for use (IFUs)?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah, so we do encourage, for the U.S., both English‐‐ its recommendation for English and encourage Spanish. But I think you're talking about another population that neither speaks English‐‐ neither reads or speaks English, reads or speaks Spanish. And the important thing about instructions is are they‐‐ are they written clearly and accurately in a new language and then test on that population as the instructions for use. That's, in being able to read them and understand them in different languages, is part of the clinical study. And I think that's an excellent question. If you were to be translating it to a new language and using it in the U.S., it would no longer be as authorized. So I think it's important to work with the FDA here. I think a pre‐EUA, even if you're not the sponsor or a developer of the test, it's free to submit a pre‐EUA. You could say‐‐ give it a little background like you did now and the languages and the settings that you would like to explore. Of course, if you're doing something under an IRB study with consent, there's a whole lot more flexibility there to test language, in this case, for whether they can do the study appropriately. It would not‐­ clinically, it should not be the test of record, though, when you do that if it's an OTC device. But certainly, there's no reason to run it by‐‐ there's no recommendation to run it by the FDA before you do, an IRB‐approved consented study in this case. But I do think that the FDA would be very interested in working with you. I would say that the [AUDIO OUT] at expanding access of OTC tests through changes to the IFU, including, I would say, changes to the language.
