#### 1. Updates on SARS-CoV-2 Test Development and Safety Concerns

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What data should be collected from enrolled vaccinated subjects to be provided in the data subset for a point of care and over-the-counter EUA low cost lateral flow antigen test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA requires the data subset to include the date of vaccination, vaccine type, number of doses (if multi-dose), and administration dates. The data must show performance stratified by vaccinated versus nonvaccinated individuals and, if necessary, present one dose versus two doses and asymptomatic versus symptomatic results.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What data should be collected from enrolled vaccinated subjects to be provided in the data subset for a point of care and over-the-counter EUA low cost lateral flow antigen test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: To address those, first, we would ask that the data be included in the clinical line data of additional columns and should include the date of vaccination, which vaccine was administered, and if it's a multi-dose vaccine the number of doses and the dates that were - that they were administered. And then it may be acceptable to include all subjects together provided that they're not pooled retrospective and prospective specimens. But we do want to see the performance stratified by nonvaccinated verse vaccinated individuals. And depending on the specific situation, we may request additional presentations of the data, such as one dose verse two doses. And we would also want to see asymptomatic and symptomatic stratified as well.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)

QA Block 1-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the expected response times for EUA submissions given the lower level of FDA staffing?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Due to reduced staffing levels, response times for EUA submissions might increase slightly, but FDA is maintaining a weekly clearance rate matching the incoming applications. Patience from sponsors is appreciated.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the expected response times for EUA submissions given the lower level of FDA staffing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We are still seeing a significant number of applications every week. I mean, and then as a monthly total for COVID EAUs, pre-EAUs, amendments, and supplements, we're seeing still around 160 to 200 applications a month. And this is keeping us very busy, especially since the surge in staff for COVID has largely returned to prior to the surge capacity and workload per reviewer. So though the surge folks have gone back to regular MDUFA work, which does include COVID pre submissions, Q submissions, and full submissions for COVID assays. That does leave us back to a lower level of staffing for EUA. And I just wanted sponsors and developers to know that. We're doing our best to keep up with the volume and largely we're clearing applications weekly at the same - approximately at the same rate that we're receiving them. So we should be cycling through on a pretty routine basis. So but because we have fewer staff, our times for responses and everything may go up a little bit. This is unfortunate, we know. We're doing the best we can. We ask for your patience.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: How does the FDA recommend developers respond to recalls of unauthorized tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA emphasizes that unauthorized tests, like those from Lepu Medical Technology, should be recalled under a Class I recall due to their unauthorized distribution for at-home or consumer use.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How does the FDA recommend developers respond to recalls of unauthorized tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We - on Friday of last week, we issued a safety communication regarding a Class I recall for the Lepu Medical Technology's SARS-CoV-2 Antigen and Leccurate Antibody Tests. These were tests that had not been authorized, cleared, or approved by the FDA. And the company is recalling them under a Class I recall because they were distributed as unauthorized tests. We are aware that they were distributed to pharmacies to be sold for at-home testing by consumers, as well as offered for sale directly to consumers.

#### 4. Mobile App Reporting Requirements for OTC COVID-19 Products

QA Block 4-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are there requirements other than the ability to report to health authorities for the mobile app in an over-the-counter COVID-19 product?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA clarified that there is no requirement for a mobile app to obtain initial authorization for OTC COVID-19 products. However, the goal of such an app is to report positive and negative results to public health authorities, and post-market commitments can address reporting for those without such features initially.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are there requirements other than the ability to report to health authorities for the mobile app in an over-the-counter COVID-19 product?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. So thanks for the question. I just want to clarify that this is not a requirement to make the initial authorization. We have authorized a number of OTC tests that didn't yet have a mobile App for reporting. The intent here is to assist in managing the public health crisis. And therefore, what we're asking is an App that can report positive and negative results to public health authorities, state, local, and national. So that's the intent. And that and what we've been doing is arranging a post-market commitment for those developers who don't have a reporting feature at the time of original authorization.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Annie Wright
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: mobile app requirements, COVID-19 OTC product reporting, EUA initial and post-market phases
REVIEW FLAG: False


#### 5. Using Frozen Samples for Antigen Test Development Challenges

QA Block 5-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can frozen samples collected during a post-EUA study be used to support the development of another assay for an EUA submission?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA allows the use of frozen samples for assay development when fresh positives are not quickly available. They recommend confirming performance in prospective studies, careful consideration of sample selection to avoid bias, and a freeze/thaw comparison study. Details depend on the specific device, and sponsors should consult FDA during pre-EUA discussions.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can frozen samples collected during a post-EUA study be used to support the development of another assay for an EUA submission?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We recommend that you check with us on your plans for banking for antigen tests, and to use frozen swabs, maybe direct swabs. And we're open to that pathway when enough positives can't be obtained in a prospective study quickly enough. We still want to see a prospective study, at least see the negatives and see the performance there and confirm performance and insights prospectively. And hopefully, you'll see, well, not necessarily hopefully, but maybe you'll see some positives in that prospective study. And then we're very open at this point to different methods of enriching those positives. And however, the details could be very specific to a given device. So we would ask you that you address these questions through, you know, a pre-EUA or if we have a pre-EUA to add that to the list of questions that you're asking the reviewer. So a couple of things to consider is how do you source and select those positives? And, you know, is there introduction of any selection bias that could impact evaluating actual test performance? For example, if you were to use a very insensitive test to select those positives, you would be biasing your test population to higher positives. And we want to try to see the full spectrum of positivity from low amounts of virus to high amounts of virus, you know, in your - depending on your device, but for the claim period or time period wise. And then also we have seen particularly for antigen tests where a pre-thaw cycle does increase the sensitivity of the assay. And so we would want to see some sort of freeze/thaw comparison study to a fresh sample. And there's multiple ways to do this with a bank sample or other method so do check with - do propose something and check with the FDA Team. And we would hope that there would be no bias introduced by the pre- thaw. That is, the test performance would be the same whether it's frozen prior or not. And then, you know, if there is a difference, assessing that difference and the impact on the study design. So those are some of my high- level thoughts.

So we would ask you that you address these questions through, you know, a pre-EUA or if we have a pre-EUA to add that to the list of questions that you're asking the reviewer. So a couple of things to consider is how do you source and select those positives? And, you know, is there introduction of any selection bias that could impact evaluating actual test performance? For example, if you were to use a very insensitive test to select those positives, you would be biasing your test population to higher positives.

#### 11. FDA De-Prioritization of Rapid At-Home Antigen Test Applications

QA Block 11-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Do companies that received de-prioritization notices need to reapply, or are their EUAs automatically restored in the application's queue?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA stated that companies would not automatically have EUAs restored after de-prioritization. They may reapply, but only after addressing the specific FDA concerns outlined in the notice.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Do companies that received de-prioritization notices need to reapply, or are their EUAs automatically restored in the application's queue?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So in general, it depends on the reasons for the de-prioritization. But if it was, you know, a home test and point of care test that's still a high priority, so it would not have been de-prioritized for that reason. So sponsors would've gotten some sort of information from the FDA on why we declined to review or declined the issue. Those are the two main de-prioritization reasons. And if the - a developer is able to address those concerns and wants to come in with a subsequent submission, they are free to do so. The FDA's concerns, though, would need to be addressed. Otherwise, the result may be the same.

QA Block 11-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What specific reasons might the FDA give for declining to review or issuing a de-prioritization notice for a COVID-19 diagnostic test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA might issue a de-prioritization notice or decline to review a COVID-19 diagnostic test due to submission deficiencies, lack of required validation (e.g., for at-home use), performance issues, or inadequate studies or design. Specific feedback is provided to allow developers to address concerns and resubmit.

And if the - a developer is able to address those concerns and wants to come in with a subsequent submission, they are free to do so. The FDA's concerns, though, would need to be addressed. Otherwise, the result may be the same. And I think to clarify a little bit about that question, if the test, you know, sort of otherwise appeared to meet the priorities, I think you mentioned a rapid antigen test with a potential for at-home use, they may have been de- prioritized not because they didn't meet priorities, but because there was something lacking about the submission. And so I think that's what Tim was really getting at with, you know, needing to look at the specific reasons that were given to the company so that the company can address those issues prior to resubmitting. So, for example, if it has potential for at-home use but was not validated for at-home use then that would be a potential reason why a test may have gotten one of those letters. And we would want to see that validation completed prior to resubmission. Or there could be some kind of performance issue or... Or, you know, inadequacy of the studies or design or something. So, again, that response from the FDA is specific and tailored to each developer so that the developer can decide what to do, you know, address those in an appropriate manner and come back in or not.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the FDA's requirements for a mobile app for reporting in an over-the-counter COVID-19 product after EUA approval?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA clarified that a mobile app for reporting is not required for initial EUA authorization but is intended to assist with public health management. FDA expects the app to report both positive and negative results to public health authorities at all levels. Developers without such a feature at the time of authorization are expected to commit to implementing it post-market.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the FDA's requirements for a mobile app for reporting in an over-the-counter COVID-19 product after EUA approval?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. So thanks for the question. I just want to clarify that this is not a requirement to make the initial authorization. We have authorized a number of OTC tests that didn't yet have a mobile App for reporting. The intent here is to assist in managing the public health crisis. And therefore, what we're asking is an App that can report positive and negative results to public health authorities, state, local, and national. So that's the intent. And that and what we've been doing is arranging a post-market commitment for those developers who don't have a reporting feature at the time of original authorization.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the FDA's recommendations for ensuring that antigen test performance is consistent regardless of whether a sample has been frozen or remained fresh?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends including a freeze/thaw comparison study to fresh samples for antigen tests and ensuring consistent performance. They suggest addressing concerns like selection bias and comparing performance over the full virus spectrum. They also encourage consulting the FDA for device-specific guidance, especially when positives are limited.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the FDA's recommendations for ensuring that antigen test performance is consistent regardless of whether a sample has been frozen or remained fresh?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We recommend that you check with us on your plans for banking for antigen tests, and to use frozen swabs, maybe direct swabs. And we're open to that pathway when enough positives can't be obtained in a prospective study quickly enough. We still want to see a prospective study, at least see the negatives and see the performance there and confirm performance and insights prospectively. And hopefully, you'll see, well, not necessarily hopefully, but maybe you'll see some positives in that prospective study. And then we're very open at this point to different methods of enriching those positives. And however, the details could be very specific to a given device. So we would ask you that you address these questions through, you know, a pre-EUA or if we have a pre-EUA to add that to the list of questions that you're asking the reviewer. So a couple of things to consider is how do you source and select those positives? And, you know, is there introduction of any selection bias that could impact evaluating actual test performance? For example, if you were to use a very insensitive test to select those positives, you would be biasing your test population to higher positives. And we want to try to see the full spectrum of positivity from low amounts of virus to high amounts of virus, you know, in your - depending on your device, but for the claim period or time period wise. And then also we have seen particularly for antigen tests where a pre-thaw cycle does increase the sensitivity of the assay. And so we would want to see some sort of freeze/thaw comparison study to a fresh sample. And there's multiple ways to do this with a bank sample or other method so do check with - do propose something and check with the FDA Team. And we would hope that there would be no bias introduced by the pre-thaw. That is, the test performance would be the same whether it's frozen prior or not. And then, you know, if there is a difference, assessing that difference and the impact on the study design.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the FDA's current views on the acceptability of using frozen samples in lieu of fresh samples for prospective antigen test studies?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is open to using frozen samples for antigen test studies when obtaining fresh positives is infeasible. However, they recommend specific considerations, such as freeze/thaw comparisons to fresh samples, avoiding selection bias, and proposing studies through a pre-EUA process. Performance should remain unbiased regardless of freezing.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the FDA's current views on the acceptability of using frozen samples in lieu of fresh samples for prospective antigen test studies?
