#### 1. FDA Virtual Town Hall: SARS-CoV-2 Testing Updates

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What steps should developers take if a pre-EUA question is closed by the FDA with a reference to existing templates?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Developers should refer to the FDA's validation recommendations in templates when pre-EUA questions are closed with template references. If the templates do not address their questions or a template does not exist, they should contact the FDA for further feedback.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What steps should developers take if a pre-EUA question is closed by the FDA with a reference to existing templates?
VERBATIM ANSWER: First of all, you know our templates contain important recommendations for validation and I encourage you to check those out. And then if folks, developers submit a pre-EUA and they ask questions that can be directly addressed by the templates, in order to assist us to most efficiently handle all of the applications that we get, we are going to typically close those by referencing the relevant templates. So we hope that works. If you have questions, you know that the templates don't go into them, that's where we'll focus most of our pre EUA response. And also, if there is something that you're asking that we haven't yet created a template or posted template, then obviously, that's important for us to see and provide feedback on. And again, the recommendations in the templates are exactly that, they are recommendations.

VERBATIM ANSWER: So that's a great question, we can carve that out and specify in the instructions that's for some high end moderately complex lab situations, there are those that have expressed interest in pooling for point of care. It would, in addition to the typical analytical and clinical validation for pooling addition, we would also want to look at usability in the point of care setting. You're not asking that for now, I'm just providing a little bit of additional information for those potentially, on the call who are interested. But we, you know, we're open to pooling schemes at point of care. But again, we would want to see that those untrained, you know, those health care workers in a point of care setting, who are not trained laboratorians can accurately carry out the pooling scheme and both convolute and deconvolute those and to get accurate results as well.

#### 3. Diagnostic PCR Assay Review: Timing and Submission Factors

QA Block 3-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What has been the minimum average review time for authorization of a diagnostic PCR assay?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The review time for diagnostic PCR assays varies based on priority, data quality, and adherence to FDA recommendations. High-priority tests may be reviewed quickly if issues are minimal, but delays occur when additional work or testing is needed.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Hi, this is Alyssa also, from User Wide. I have a question about what has been the minimum average review time for authorization of a diagnostic PCR assay?
VERBATIM ANSWER: That does vary considerably because of the notification pathway for these tests. We focus our attention on the highest priority items. Everyone within two weeks of an EUA submission should have a contact that they can communicate with. And those that are the highest priority and there's room on a reviewer's desk, can be moved into that slot. Once we move into interactive review with the reviewer. If there are no outstanding issues, the data is all there and the data looks good, And there's no additional testing that may be requested, Those applications move relatively quickly. However, if they're priority and they get into viewers desk, but there is a substantial amount of work yet to be done and additional testing and things like that it can slow things down. So, we do encourage developers to, as closely as possible, follow our recommendations and to pre check with us, you know, prior to doing any alternatives so that we don't lose time on either the developer side or on the reviewer's side. And also, you know if there are problems with the review, rather with the application, where there's clearly not a match between what our recommendations are and expectations are for performance and your actual test, That's going to slow things down as well. We do look at the ponderous of evidence, but by and large, we've set our recommendations, at what we believe are very appropriate levels. So, we are asking all developers to work with us and that will speed things up for all of us.

#### 4. FDA Submission Review Process and Timelines

QA Block 4-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: If new studies not indicated in the pre-EUA are needed, does updating the submission result in losing the place in the review queue?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA states that reviewers handle updates based on their discretion. They may pass the task to support staff for additional study design, and once the data returns, reviewers address it as soon as possible. To manage workload, reviewers continue with new applications in the meantime.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If new studies not indicated in the pre-EUA are needed, does updating the submission result in losing the place in the review queue?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So yes, that, you know, is mostly left up to the individual reviewer at this time. So, they don't waste time of theirs, they may hand that off to one of our other support staff, with the recommended additional study design. And then when that comes back in with that data, then that reviewer will be notified that the requested additional data has been provided. And then the reviewer as soon as they can, can get back to that. But in order to manage all the volume of applications as efficiently as possible, those reviewers will move on to new applications. So anyways, I wanted to provide that clarity to you.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Arvita Tripati

QA Block 4-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the current turnaround time for antigen testing review?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Turnaround time for antigen testing review varies greatly based on the completeness, organization of data, and need for additional studies. While well-prepared applications may be reviewed quickly, high application volume and unclear submissions can cause delays.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the current turnaround time for antigen testing review?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So, again, it depends, it depends greatly on the application. When we receive an application that has everything there and it's well organized, easy to understand, the data are acceptable and no additional studies are needed. Those move incredibly fast. Obviously, we're having a lot more applications right now. Versus in the early days, when we can turn things around in as little as a day. Those times are not necessarily with us right now, because of the volume. And our desire to work with as many developers as our reviewers can handle in moving them along, all along as quickly as possible. So, it does vary greatly. So again, if additional studies are requested, that can slow things down, if things aren't clear. If study designs are not clear, we do look at more than the data, we look at the study designs to make sure that the studies were performed per our recommendations. And in that there are no potential factors that could influence our review. So, in addition to setting the data, it is great to have the study designs there. So, the fewer questions that we that we identify in the review, the fewer questions you the developers get to answer and the faster things go. So again, even for direct antigen, when those submissions are well put together, well organized, everything looks, you know, shipshape, then those can go incredibly fast.

VERBATIM QUESTION: How can applicants ensure their submissions are well-organized for faster review?
VERBATIM ANSWER: When we receive an application that has everything there and it's well organized, easy to understand, the data are acceptable and no additional studies are needed. Those move incredibly fast. Obviously, we're having a lot more applications right now. Versus in the early days, when we can turn things around in as little as a day. Those times are not necessarily with us right now, because of the volume. And our desire to work with as many developers as our reviewers can handle in moving them along, all along as quickly as possible. So, it does vary greatly. So again, if additional studies are requested, that can slow things down, if things aren't clear. If study designs are not clear, we do look at more than the data, we look at the study designs to make sure that the studies were performed per our recommendations. And in that there are no potential factors that could influence our review. So, in addition to setting the data, it is great to have the study designs there. So, the fewer questions that we that we identify in the review, the fewer questions you the developers get to answer and the faster things go. So again, even for direct antigen, when those submissions are well put together, well organized, everything looks, you know, shipshape, then those can go incredibly fast.

#### 5. Assessing Complexity for Point of Care Test Authorization

QA Block 5-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Could the substitution of a simpler liquid transfer mechanism take an assay from being a highly complex assay to a CLIA-waived point of care assay?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA evaluates whether untrained CLIA-waived lab workers can perform an assay with simplified tools like bulb pipettors instead of precision pipettes. Factors such as centrifugation, vortexing, or freezer requirements may influence the decision, assessed case-by-case, with flexibility during the pandemic.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Could the substitution of a simpler liquid transfer mechanism take an assay from being a highly complex assay to a CLIA-waived point of care assay?
VERBATIM ANSWER: First of all, precision pipetting with the calibrated pipette is not something that most CLIA waived labs have and nor are those healthcare workers trained in it's correct operation. However, most of the point of care devices, if they have a pipetting step, they have a little bulb, plastic bulb pipettor is common. You know, and so that's what we look for, things requiring centrifugation, things requiring vortexing, things requiring freezers, those are all you know, a little bit different. We will take them all one by one and assess them as to whether or not a CLIA waived environment worker can properly operate them. We are taking for at least this pandemic and in order to speed things along, we are maintaining a very open mind. That may, you know, as far as this, it may.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the fundamental components of an assay that FDA would deem appropriate for point of care authorization that is not linked to an existing platform?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA requires that point-of-care assays be simple enough for untrained healthcare workers to use in CLIA-waived settings. The kit should be self-contained, have minimal steps, rely on easy-to-follow instructions (often pictorial), and not require laboratory equipment.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the fundamental components of an assay that FDA would deem appropriate for point of care authorization that is not linked to an existing platform?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The bottom line than an untrained user that is a healthcare worker in a CLIA Waived of setting, a clinic sort of setting. And now in this pandemic, it could be a school setting with a waiver, a certificate of waiver, or a work certificate of waiver and not anybody related at all to a health care facility in the prior, that they can open up the box, read the instructions perform the test accurately and get acceptable results. Bottom line, that's what it is. And they don't have, they don't have a laboratory setup. So, the more everything is self-contained within the kit, the better. The fewer the steps and reading the results and interpretation of the results should be straightforward. Typically, in that kind of CLIA waived of setting, you don't even have a long instructions for use. You have a quick user reference instructions, mostly pictures.

#### 7. Developing Home Antigen Tests with FDA Guidance

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is it allowable to use a mid-turbinate swab instead of a nasopharyngeal swab for a home-use antigen test with FDA discussion?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA is open to using mid-turbinate swabs for home-use antigen tests. However, considerations need to be made for children, such as adapting the swab for safety. Details on development and validation should be addressed with FDA's review staff or through the home test template email contact.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is it allowable to use a mid-turbinate swab instead of a nasopharyngeal swab for a home-use antigen test with FDA discussion?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Okay. Well, we are very open to a home mid -turbinate use. And I don't know that we've authorized a mid-turbinate, but we've certainly expressed that in multiple occasions. The only caveat to that is in the home environment, we want to look at whether children would be swapped or not with a mid- turbinate. And if so, there are stoppers or other devices that can be utilized with a mid-turbinate swab that makes it appropriate for kids and it can be removed for adults. So that's the only sort of caveat on mid-turbinate. It would be unlikely for a direct antigen test to be more sensitive than a molecular test in the home situation. So, we want to compare it to an authorized version of the test, an EUA test, and typically I think in our recommendations, we say a high sensitivity test. And that can be performed in a lot of different settings. We're open to entirely in the true truly home setting. But you can also do have the users come into a simulated home environment and do testing. And then obviously, after they've collected the sample for your home test and tested it, they can be swapped by a healthcare worker and then sent in for an EUA authorized test. So probably some of those details that you're talking about, you know, would best be worked out with one of our review staff. So, if something is again, an alternate sort of pathway, then in our recommendations for the template from the home test template, then I would reach out through our templates email address and asked those specific targeted questions.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are mid-turbinate swabs appropriate for use in children for home tests, and are there specific requirements for their design?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is open to the use of mid-turbinate swabs for home tests, but for children, stoppers or similar devices are required to ensure their suitability for kids, which can then be removed for adults.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are mid-turbinate swabs appropriate for use in children for home tests, and are there specific requirements for their design?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Okay. Well, we are very open to a home mid -turbinate use. And I don't know that we've authorized a mid-turbinate, but we've certainly expressed that in multiple occasions. The only caveat to that is in the home environment, we want to look at whether children would be swapped or not with a mid- turbinate.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is it acceptable to compare a home antigen test to an EUA-authorized high sensitivity molecular test during validation?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends comparing a home antigen test to an EUA-authorized high sensitivity molecular test. Validation can occur in various settings, including simulated or actual home environments.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is it acceptable to compare a home antigen test to an EUA-authorized high sensitivity molecular test during validation?
VERBATIM ANSWER: It would be unlikely for a direct antigen test to be more sensitive than a molecular test in the home situation. So, we want to compare it to an authorized version of the test, an EUA test, and typically I think in our recommendations, we say a high sensitivity test. And that can be performed in a lot of different settings. We're open to entirely in the true truly home setting. But you can also do have the users come into a simulated home environment and do testing. And then obviously, after they've collected the sample for your home test and tested it, they can be swapped by a healthcare worker and then sent in for an EUA authorized test.

#### 11. Guidelines for At-Home Antigen Test Performance and Usability Studies

QA Block 11-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the differences in positive predictive value between home use diagnostic kits and home use surveillance kits in a multipack format?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA defines surveillance as population-level observation without individual CLIA results. They recommend using EUA-authorized tests, but it's not required. For home diagnostic kits (symptomatic individuals) and home screening kits (asymptomatic but at risk), FDA templates provide clear performance expectations. They distinguish between positive predictive value (PPV), which is population-based, and positive percent agreement (PPA), which measures accuracy against a reference test. PPV for antigen tests can vary widely depending on population infection rates.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the differences in positive predictive value between home use diagnostic kits and home use surveillance kits in a multipack format?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So, for truly surveillance purposes as defined in our FAQ, and you can go there, for this pandemic, the FDA is not reviewing those. We do obviously recommend that in those situations an EUA authorized test be used, but it's not a requirement. And there are different, you can check with CMS and in CLIA, there are different reporting, you know, there I don't believe there's reporting requirements, but double check with them. So, for home use diagnosis, that's somebody with symptoms, home use screening, for those who may otherwise be at risk and could be asymptomatic carriers. There are clear recommendations in our templates, if you go to our template at the FDA website for what's probably called home use testing includes both molecular and antigen recommendations for that environment, it has all the recommended performance expectation. When you're talking about PPV, there's difference between PPV and PPA positive predictive value versus percent positive agreement. Percent positive agreement is when you're comparing your method to some other method. We recommend EUA authorized high sensitivity molecular test. That's really looking at you know, when the reference test is positive, how many times out of 100 is your test that you're developing positive? So, if it's positive, say, you know 90% of the time when the high sensitivity molecular test is positive, then your PPA or sensitivity would be 90%. Positive predictive value has to do with it's more of a population based measure. Yes, we do look at PPV for direct antigen tests, but that PPV can vary widely depending on the percent positivity in a given population.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Does surveillance mean something specific in this context, as distinct from screening and home use diagnosis?
VERBATIM ANSWER: I understood home use diagnosis and then I'm not sure if you meant screening when you saying surveillance or are you talking truly surveillance as we have defined on our FDA FAQ webpage.

QA Block 11-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the FDA's recommendations for positive predictive value for individual tests and for overall multipack tests in the context of at-home use screening and diagnosis?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA looks at positive predictive value (PPV) for direct antigen tests, acknowledging that PPV depends on population positivity rates. However, there is no specific PPV recommendation. For home tests, FDA outlines expectations for specificity, sensitivity, and performance in templates. For single-use tests, 80% sensitivity is preferred, but lower sensitivity (70%) may be acceptable for serial tests achieving combined performance above 80%.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the FDA's recommendations for positive predictive value for individual tests and for overall multipack tests in the context of at-home use screening and diagnosis?
VERBATIM ANSWER: All right, so, yes. So, for truly surveillance purposes as defined in our FAQ, and you can go there, for this pandemic, the FDA is not reviewing those. We do obviously recommend that in those situations an EUA authorized test be used, but it's not a requirement. And there are different, you can check with CMS and in CLIA, there are different reporting, you know, there I don't believe there's reporting requirements, but double check with them. So, for home use diagnosis, that's somebody with symptoms, home use screening, for those who may otherwise be at risk and could be asymptomatic carriers. There are clear recommendations in our templates, if you go to our template at the FDA website for what's probably called home use testing includes both molecular and antigen recommendations for that environment, it has all the recommended performance expectation. When you're talking about PPV, there's difference between PPV and PPA positive predictive value versus percent positive agreement. Percent positive agreement is when you're comparing your method to some other method. We recommend EUA authorized high sensitivity molecular test. That's really looking at you know, when the reference test is positive, how many times out of 100 is your test that you're developing positive? So, if it's positive, say, you know 90% of the time when the high sensitivity molecular test is positive, then your PPA or sensitivity would be 90%. Positive predictive value has to do with it's more of a population based measure. Yes, we do look at PPV for direct antigen tests, but that PPV can vary widely depending on the percent positivity in a given population. When a population has a very low incidence of active coronavirus infection, you know, a test like indirect antigen test that may have a specificity of 99%, would have quite a low PPV. I think I mentioned recently, that if the prevalence of SARS infection detectable with a direct antigen test is 0.2%. The test is 99% specific, the positive predictive value is 16%. So, you know, basically five out of six positive results are false positives. And that doesn't mean there's anything wrong with the test. It just means that in a low percent positive population, you're going to, even with a relatively high specific test, like 99% pretty high. Hard to go above that significantly within with a direct antigen test. You just want to confirm those results, I think with another test. So, we don't have typically a specific recommendation for PPV. We do have expectations for specificity and sensitivity or PPA and NPA. Negative percentage agreement and positive percent agreement. And we would for direct antigen test as for molecular tests in the home environment, when it's done by prescription, it's the same expectation as any other and viral detection method and that is what I like to see.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the FDA's expectations for sensitivity and specificity of at-home antigen tests used in a serial testing scenario?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA expects direct antigen tests to achieve at least 80% sensitivity (PPA) for single use. For serial testing with a two-pack, sequential tests may have a combined sensitivity that reaches the 80% threshold, even if individual tests are lower (e.g., 70%).
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the FDA's expectations for sensitivity and specificity of at-home antigen tests used in a serial testing scenario?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We do have expectations for specificity and sensitivity or PPA and NPA. Negative percentage agreement and positive percent agreement. And we would for direct antigen test as for molecular tests in the home environment, when it's done by prescription, it's the same expectation as any other and viral detection method and that is what I like to see. For single use, we'd like to see 80% PPA or sensitivity or greater. We are open, as we've stated, as Jeff and I stated in our recent op ed in the hill, we are open to a lower single test PPA. You know, we mentioned 70%. If some sort of serial testing, a two- pack, perhaps have the test done on consecutive days or in days 1 days 3, is able to in a combined sense, get us to that 80% mark, we may indeed find that acceptable.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: How does population positivity rate affect the positive predictive value (PPV) of direct antigen tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The population positivity rate significantly impacts the PPV of direct antigen tests. In low-incidence populations, even a test with 99% specificity may yield a low PPV, such as 16% at 0.2% prevalence, meaning most positive results could be false positives. Additional confirmatory testing is recommended in such cases.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How does population positivity rate affect the positive predictive value (PPV) of direct antigen tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Positive predictive value has to do with it's more of a population based measure. Yes, we do look at PPV for direct antigen tests, but that PPV can vary widely depending on the percent positivity in a given population. When a population has a very low incidence of active coronavirus infection, you know, a test like indirect antigen test that may have a specificity of 99%, would have quite a low PPV. I think I mentioned recently, that if the prevalence of SARS infection detectable with a direct antigen test is 0.2%. The test is 99% specific, the positive predictive value is 16%. So, you know, basically five out of six positive results are false positives. And that doesn't mean there's anything wrong with the test. It just means that in a low percent positive population, you're going to, even with a relatively high specific test, like 99% pretty high. Hard to go above that significantly within with a direct antigen test. You just want to confirm those results, I think with another test.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: How should developers address scenarios where a single test sensitivity falls below 80%, but serial testing over consecutive days may achieve the target sensitivity?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA is open to single test sensitivity as low as 70%, provided serial testing (e.g., on consecutive or alternate days) achieves a combined sensitivity of 80% or higher. This is particularly important for identifying individuals in the first 5-7 days of infection when viral loads are highest.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How should developers address scenarios where a single test sensitivity falls below 80%, but serial testing over consecutive days may achieve the target sensitivity?
VERBATIM ANSWER: For single use, we'd like to see 80% PPA or sensitivity or greater.

#### 12. Temperature Validation for Point of Care Testing Robustness

QA Block 12-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Why is there a need for performing point of care testing at 40 degrees Celsius when the average temperature in some areas is not that extreme?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends testing at 40°C because point-of-care tests may be used in non-healthcare settings without air conditioning, such as pop-up tents. Alternatives can be proposed, and labeling adjustments might be applied based on test performance to ensure appropriate usage conditions are clear.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Yes. My question is pertaining to point of care testing. With regards to the six further components of robustness testing. And one of the elements requires the test to be performed at high temperature. I was just wondering about how you rationalize the need for doing the test at 40 degrees Celsius when the average temperature around here is not even that extreme conditions? And is it really required for us to do that type of a temperature stress test, for point of care testing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So those are our recommendations. If you want to propose alternate, that's fine. We may put limitation, temperature limitations, in your instructions for use. But we are seeing that these kind of point of care tests sometimes are used and in non-healthcare settings now, that may not have air conditioning. And so, in sometimes they're pop up tents and things like that. So that's the reason for asking that kind of temperature variation. But again, you know, we can label around certain potential, we have the option, when everything else looks good to look at whether or not we alter the labeling for your product. And it might say if your test, for example, doesn't perform well, we might say must be performed in, in temperature controlled environment between these temperatures. But it's really working with you to figure out when your test performs well. So, you know, so we asked for these flex studies. And we want to see if there is any impact on your test performance. And then It doesn't necessarily mean if there's an impact that we wouldn't authorize your test. It's simply that we want to alert users, that certain variables may impact the performance of the test. So, I'll pause there in case you have any clarifying questions. Hopefully that was clear and justifies why we asked those important questions.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What kind of discussion is required with the FDA to use a mid-turbinate swab for a home-use antigen test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is open to home mid-turbinate swab use but suggests ensuring child safety through stoppers. Tests should be validated against high-sensitivity, EUA-authorized tests either in a home or simulated environment. Specific discussions should be initiated through FDA's templates email address.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What kind of discussion is required with the FDA to use a mid-turbinate swab for a home-use antigen test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Okay. Well, we are very open to a home mid -turbinate use. And I don't know that we've authorized a mid-turbinate, but we've certainly expressed that in multiple occasions. The only caveat to that is in the home environment, we want to look at whether children would be swapped or not with a mid- turbinate. And if so, there are stoppers or other devices that can be utilized with a mid-turbinate swab that makes it appropriate for kids and it can be removed for adults. So that's the only sort of caveat on mid-turbinate. It would be unlikely for a direct antigen test to be more sensitive than a molecular test in the home situation. So, we want to compare it to an authorized version of the test, an EUA test, and typically I think in our recommendations, we say a high sensitivity test. And that can be performed in a lot of different settings. We're open to entirely in the true truly home setting. But you can also do have the users come into a simulated home environment and do testing. And then obviously, after they've collected the sample for your home test and tested it, they can be swapped by a healthcare worker and then sent in for an EUA authorized test. So probably some of those details that you're talking about, you know, would best be worked out with one of our review staff. So, if something is again, an alternate sort of pathway, then in our recommendations for the template from the home test template, then I would reach out through our templates email address and asked those specific targeted questions.
