#### 1. FDA Updates on SARS-CoV-2 Testing and Variants

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the specific procedural requirements for using the Curative molecular EUA test to prevent false results?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends that the Curative molecular EUA test is only used for symptomatic patients within the first 14 days of symptoms. Off-label use is not allowed. If an oral swab test result is negative, it should be confirmed with another test to avoid false results.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the specific procedural requirements for using the Curative molecular EUA test to prevent false results?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We are recommending no off label use. Again, no off label use. The test, nasal swab and oral fluid, are to be only used with patients who are symptomatic and in the first 14 days of symptoms. We are warning against false results if these procedures are not followed. In addition, if an oral swab test is a negative, it should be confirmed with another test.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Curative EUA test requirements, false results prevention, test confirmation steps
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What steps should labs take if negative results occur when using oral swabs?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: If an oral swab test result is negative, it should be confirmed with another test.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What steps should labs take if negative results occur when using oral swabs?
VERBATIM ANSWER: In addition, if an oral swab test is a negative, it should be confirmed with another test.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Negative results, Oral swab testing, Test confirmation
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How should test results outside the 14-day symptom onset window be interpreted?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends no specific action for test results older than 14 days. However, for results within the 14-day window, consider the full clinical context and retest if necessary.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How should test results outside the 14-day symptom onset window be interpreted?
VERBATIM ANSWER: You know, for those who are concerned with results they may have received, if those results are more than 14 days old, there's really nothing that we recommend doing. However if the results from Curative have been received within the last 14 days, do look at the entire clinical picture and if warranted test with another test.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Interpreting test results, 14-day symptom window
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the FDA threshold for determining the significance of a SARS-CoV-2 mutation's impact on test sensitivity?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA considers a SARS-CoV-2 mutation significant if it appears in at least 5% of cases and causes a test's sensitivity to decrease by 5% or more. For molecular tests near 100% sensitivity, a drop to below 95% warrants further review.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the FDA threshold for determining the significance of a SARS-CoV-2 mutation's impact on test sensitivity?
VERBATIM ANSWER: From the very beginning of the pandemic, the FDA has been asking all developers of tests to do an in silico analysis to make sure that their tests are inclusive of all known mutations. That mutation database has grown over time and continues to grow. Mid-summer, the FDA began a more active surveillance of those tests that had been EUA authorized. We know all of the primer and probe sequences for molecular tests and we also have access to the GISAID database. And so we do an analysis on a regular basis of the GISAID database. We search for mutations that exist in a prevalence. Right now we're about 5%. And the reason we chose 5% is that if the test has a decreased sensitivity of 5% or more and in particular a molecular test that may be near 100% and falls 5% or more, it falls below 95% sensitivity, then that's something that we definitely want to look into.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: SARS-CoV-2 mutations, Test sensitivity threshold, FDA mutation evaluation
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-5
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What guidance does the FDA provide for analyzing the impact of highly prevalent variants on EUA-authorized tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA advises developers to conduct in silico analysis to ensure tests detect known mutations. It uses GISAID data to monitor mutations with a 5% prevalence threshold, helping identify tests that might be affected and collaborating with developers to assess potential impacts.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What guidance does the FDA provide for analyzing the impact of highly prevalent variants on EUA-authorized tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: From the very beginning of the pandemic, the FDA has been asking all developers of tests to do an in silico analysis to make sure that their tests are inclusive of all known mutations. That mutation database has grown over time and continues to grow. Mid- summer, the FDA began a more active surveillance of those tests that had been EUA authorized.

And the reason we chose 5% is that if the test has a decreased sensitivity of 5% or more and in particular a molecular test that may be near 100% and falls 5% or more, it falls below 95% sensitivity, then that's something that we definitely want to look into. No matter what, when we identify a test that may be impacted by a variant of importance at that 5% level or in the case of the South African variant and the UK variant, we have or are in the process of reaching out to all test developers of the EUA authorized test to have them, in conjunction with us, do a review of the potential impact of those mutations.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Variant monitoring, EUA test impact, Mutation analysis
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-6
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What procedures should labs follow to confirm if they have detected the UK variant or other variants carrying Δ69/70 deletion?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Labs should perform sequence confirmation using local or state sequencing resources, contact CDC for guidance, or use the FDA-authorized Illumina SARS test. They are encouraged to submit sequences to databases for FDA monitoring.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What procedures should labs follow to confirm if they have detected the UK variant or other variants carrying Δ69/70 deletion?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So sequence confirmation is recommended. So local labs may have their own sequencing or state and local labs may - other labs may have some capability. And, of course, the CDC is doing a sequencing analysis and labs can reach out to the CDC for any guidance. We have also authorized a sequencing base EUA that covers the entire viral genome and that is the Illumina SARS test. And so that is an opportunity for labs to confirm whether or not they have a UK variant. We would ask that where labs are capable of doing this that the labs do this that they submit as many sequences that they generate as they can into databases so that the FDA can continue to monitor the databases for variants.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: UK variant detection, Δ69/70 deletion, sequence confirmation
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-7
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How can laboratories contribute their sequencing data to national or FDA databases?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA requests that laboratories capable of sequencing submit as many sequences as possible to databases. This helps FDA monitor variants and understand their prevalence better.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How can laboratories contribute their sequencing data to national or FDA databases?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We would ask that where labs are capable of doing this that the labs do this that they submit as many sequences that they generate as they can into databases so that the FDA can continue to monitor the databases for variants. And this would be not just be the UK variant but all sequences. It's important that we get as many sequences as we can in the database and be able to understand a little better perhaps the true prevalence of what some of these variants are.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Laboratory sequencing data, Variant monitoring, Database contributions
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-8
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the FDA's expectations for addressing sensitivity issues related to mutations in single target tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA identified that single-target tests, such as the Mesa Biotech Accula test, may experience minor sensitivity impacts due to mutations, like the GGG to AAC mutation. While immediate clinical sensitivity concerns are minimal, single-target assays are comparatively more vulnerable to variants than multi-target assays. Developers are advised to remain vigilant and report potential issues to the FDA.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the FDA's expectations for addressing sensitivity issues related to mutations in single target tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The other tests that were mentioned in the safety communication was the Mesa Biotech Accula, I believe, test. They are a single target test and they were potentially impacted by the GGG to AAC mutation. They have updated their labeling to show the potential impact of this mutation. However at this time the impact seems relatively minor and we don't expect that any significant drop in clinical sensitivity will be seen in this assay. This is a point of care molecular assay and I do believe that it's still useful to be used. And we just want users to be aware that in all cases, because these kind of false negatives from these variants can happen with any test and false negatives can happen with any test, so the patient context and all other clinical information for any negative should - of course, it should always be entertained that any given single test result might be falsely negative. We will continue to surveil the variants that pass our threshold for routine reaching out to sponsors. But we'll also continue to surveil new variants that may be of important public interest. When we find something that deserves to be shared with the entire community, we will update our safety comm to do so. And then, of course, it goes without saying that single target assays do have a slight disadvantage in the situation where we're seeing multiple variants relative to multiple targeted assays. So I think we've gotten to the point in this pandemic with enough variants and sequences that developers should consider this carefully. We would also ask developers to continue to monitor the situation themselves and be very proactive and if they spot an issue to please contact the FDA.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: single-target test sensitivity, mutation impact, developer vigilance
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-9
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How should developers of single target assays address the increased risk of false negatives caused by emerging variants?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA advises developers of single-target assays to consider the risks of false negatives due to emerging variants and to actively monitor the situation, contacting the FDA if issues arise.
VERBATIM QUESTION: IMPLICIT
VERBATIM ANSWER: And then, of course, it goes without saying that single target assays do have a slight disadvantage in the situation where we're seeing multiple variants relative to multiple targeted assays. So I think we've gotten to the point in this pandemic with enough variants and sequences that developers should consider this carefully. We would also ask developers to continue to monitor the situation themselves and be very proactive and if they spot an issue to please contact the FDA.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: emerging variants, false negatives, single-target assays
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-10
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What resources has the FDA allocated to manage the high volume of EUA submissions?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA has allocated additional resources to review the high volume of EUA submissions, processing around 160 per month. This has enabled faster decision-making, a reduction in pending applications, and an increase in authorizations.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What resources has the FDA allocated to manage the high volume of EUA submissions?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Our surge of putting additional resources on EUA reviews is making significant progress. We are still receiving a high volume of new submissions on the order of about 40 EUA submissions a month - I mean a week so about 160 a month. That is a high volume and yet we're focused on a net decrease in open applications so that we can, you know, go through all of the open EUAs and also as a very robust and efficient process for the new EUAs. So it is making now a significant impact on the net closure and that's evidenced by more and more authorizations as you've seen. But we are making all sorts of decisions at a faster clip now.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: EUA submissions, resource allocation, FDA review process

#### 2. Guidance on Post-Authorization Software Changes for Home Tests

QA Block 2-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: If a post-authorization change is made to a phone application used in human usability testing, such as modifying text on the results screen to align with FDA recommendations, would we need to submit a notice to the FDA, submit an authorization, or internally justify it and proceed?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends discussing potential software changes with your reviewer before initial authorization. Situations may allow inclusion of change protocols in the authorization, detailing validations needed for certain changes to avoid post-authorization submissions. Major updates, however, might require a supplemental EUA.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If a post-authorization change is made to a phone application used in human usability testing, such as modifying text on the results screen to align with FDA recommendations, would we need to submit a notice to the FDA, submit an authorization, or internally justify it and proceed?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Okay. Yes, so I think this is a great opportunity to have these discussions about potential software changes with your reviewer prior to your initial authorization. There are situations where we might be able to build into the authorization what we often refer to as change protocols so that we would work with you ahead of time to work through what validation you would need to do for those changes and what metrics you would need to hit in order to not come in post- market with those software changes or post-authorization. But there may be other situations where we would expect to see a supplemental EUA request to update depending on what the changes are. So it's a really good idea ahead of your initial authorization to talk through what source of software changes you would anticipate so that you can come to an agreement with your lead reviewer on the best approach for each of those types of changes.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Shannon Clark
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: post-authorization changes, software validation, regulatory guidance
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 2-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: If a phone application change allows skipping a previously automatic timer, would such a change require FDA notification, submission for authorization, or internal justification to proceed?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Discuss proposed software changes with the FDA reviewer before initial authorization. This could involve creating change protocols ahead of time or, depending on the changes, submitting a supplemental EUA. Pre-authorization discussions can streamline the process.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If a phone application change allows skipping a previously automatic timer, would such a change require FDA notification, submission for authorization, or internal justification to proceed?
VERBATIM ANSWER: That's an important question that I'm not sure that I have the best possible answer right now. Certainly we love to see improvements and increased safety with software. It never hurts to communicate with your reviewer for the - original reviewer for the application to see if they have any concerns about that. Obviously if there's any potential for degradation of performance, we would want to absolutely review that... Okay. Yes, so I think this is a great opportunity to have these discussions about potential software changes with your reviewer prior to your initial authorization. There are situations where we might be able to build into the authorization what we often refer to as change protocols so that we would work with you ahead of time to work through what validation you would need to do for those changes and what metrics you would need to hit in order to not come in post- market with those software changes or post-authorization.

TOPICS: software updates, FDA authorization, usability testing
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 2-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is the FDA still amenable to smaller-scale usability studies, such as justifying skipping a timer, or do the strict authorization guidelines risk requiring full 100-person usability studies?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA aims to avoid full usability study repeats and is amenable to scaled-down studies for minor changes, unless significant changes that might impact performance are involved.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is the FDA still amenable to smaller-scale usability studies, such as justifying skipping a timer, or do the strict authorization guidelines risk requiring full 100-person usability studies?
VERBATIM ANSWER: I would like to avoid a full repeat. So I think a scaled down version is acceptable in the specific situations with the specific changes would be ideal. And, you know, I would hope to be able to do that in all cases. If there's major changes that might impact performance that might be different. But in general these kind of changes should be amenable to smaller scale user studies.

#### 4. FDA Prioritization of Point-of-Care Serology Test EUAs

QA Block 4-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Will FDA review an EUA for a serology test intended for point of care or at-home use if it meets the stated priority?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA prioritizes EUA reviews for serology tests intended for point of care or at-home use, but only if the necessary validations are done and submitted. Incomplete submissions will likely be rejected.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Will FDA review an EUA for a serology test intended for point of care or at-home use if it meets the stated priority?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We've only authorized a small number of point of care serology tests. It has been a priority and continues to be a priority to authorize point of care serology tests and at-home, either prescription or OTC, the qualitative lateral flow test. So it remains a priority. However we have authorized a number of moderate to high complexity lateral flow tests. We've also authorized a number of really high throughput central lab tests. And so because there's so many high throughput central lab tests authorized, the need for a moderate complex or high complex test given our workload has diminished. And so we are eager to review point of care tests of all sorts and especially those that come in with, you know, all the good studies that have already been performed so that we can evaluate the tests. We continue to get point of care submissions that don't have the point of care validations done. So that's obviously problematic. We won't make a test submission a high priority unless we have, you know, all the point of care validations done and submitted with the package. We are looking more closely at submissions. And if they are missing key elements, especially that are in our templates for the various applications, we are doing an RTA, which is Refuse To Accept. Some developers may be starting to see that. We do a quick review. And so that communication should happen within about a 10 day window from receipt. This is really being applied to every application now. It's very inefficient for our staff to get an application that's incomplete. And so we have screeners that are looking at these applications and making sure that they're complete. If they're not complete, we are giving this really quick feedback so that developers can complete the studies and come in with a full package that we can spend time reviewing.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Jenna McCarthy
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: EUA process for serology tests, Point of care and at-home tests, Submission completeness requirements
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 4-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is FDA signaling a broader de-prioritization of all qualitative serology tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA is not signaling a de-prioritization of all qualitative serology tests. Point of care and at-home tests remain priorities, but the need for moderate to high complexity tests is reduced.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is FDA signaling a broader de-prioritization of all qualitative serology tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We've only authorized a small number of point of care serology tests. It has been a priority and continues to be a priority to authorize point of care serology tests and at-home, either prescription or OTC, the qualitative lateral flow test. So it remains a priority. However we have authorized a number of moderate to high complexity lateral flow tests. We've also authorized a number of really high throughput central lab tests. And so because there's so many high throughput central lab tests authorized, the need for a moderate complex or high complex test given our workload has diminished. And so we are eager to review point of care tests of all sorts and especially those that come in with, you know, all the good studies that have already been performed so that we can evaluate the tests.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the specific validation requirements for point of care serology test submissions?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Point of care serology test submissions must include all point of care validations and comply with the templates provided in FDA guidance. Incomplete submissions may result in an RTA (Refuse to Accept) notice being issued within 10 days.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the specific validation requirements for point of care serology test submissions?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We continue to get point of care submissions that don't have the point of care validations done. So that's obviously problematic. We won't make a test submission a high priority unless we have, you know, all the point of care validations done and submitted with the package. We are looking more closely at submissions. And if they are missing key elements, especially that are in our templates for the various applications, we are doing an RTA, which is Refuse To Accept. Some developers may be starting to see that.

VERBATIM QUESTION: What is FDA's stance on the reporting portion requirement for at-home antigen tests without an initial reporting plan?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. Let me take the last question first. So we do ask what the reporting plans are for point of care and at-home tests. However having a plan in place is not a requirement for an authorization. However we are asking developers who haven't come with a reporting plan for authorization that in the post-authorization period that they work to develop a reporting method. That could be an app. That could be a Web site. HHS had a design-a-thon that has progressed and the winners have been selected. And so our team can put you in touch with some of these software developers so that even in your development phase so that you can begin to work with them. And if not prior to authorization then hopefully shortly after authorization, those reporting opportunities can be put into place. So the short answer is we would not hold up an authorization if there's not a reporting opportunity at the time we can make an authorization decision. But we certainly want to see developers, post-market at least, develop an opportunity. And we're doing our part with the design-a-thon.

#### 6. Evaluating Serological Assays for Vaccinated and PCR-Negative Individuals

QA Block 6-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: If we enroll subjects who are symptomatic or who were symptomatic, who were PCR negative but have been vaccinated and test antibody positive, will they still be considered false positives on our serological assay?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA suggests that vaccinated individuals testing antibody positive post-vaccination may not be surprising, and the decision to classify them as false positives on serological assays should be based on study design. Exclusion or inclusion criteria for vaccinated individuals depend on the goals of the study, and FDA remains open to reviewing study designs on this matter.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If we enroll subjects who are symptomatic or who were symptomatic, who were PCR negative but have been vaccinated and test antibody positive, will they still be considered false positives on our serological assay?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Someone who has been vaccinated and turns positive, you know, within a couple of weeks of a vaccination, it wouldn't be surprising that they would turn positive by a serological assay. So although I don't think we know enough about the serological response in a patient to be able to blanket say what we would do with somebody who is post-vaccine. And, you know, that's something that's best put into inclusion and exclusion criteria for your clinical study. So for all clinical studies, we do want to see clinical study designs and we do want to look at your inclusion and exclusion criteria and make sure that things are done appropriately. So if you want to exclude people who got vaccinated and are PCR negative, that's probably at this point an acceptable exclusion criteria. In the future we may understand a vaccination better and that might be something we want to incorporate into clinical study designs as we go forward. And if someone wants to include a subset of people who are vaccinated at this point, I think, you know, we can look at that. Now the antibody response to vaccines, it's a further leap to say that because they generated antibodies then they have immune status or a given immune status. I think we're too early on in the science here to say anything definitively about any immune status. But we're open to study designs that would address that question.

VERBATIM QUESTION: If a single target SARS test is built on the same technology as a panel test, but the panel test de novo is granted first, can the single target test be submitted as a 510k using the multi-target test as predicate?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Well that's an interesting thought. And, you know, these special controls that are written with de novo applications and become part of the regulations have certain limitations. So some of this is, you know, how can we adequately carve these things out? So our current thinking is that for a molecular or an antigen panel versus a single target assay that those would still be different on de novos. So we're really talking primarily just probably two first de novos for molecular testing and two first de novos for antigen tests and then after those four de novos then everybody else is 510k.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Will the priority for EUA submissions delay the FDA's ability to process conversions to de novos or 510ks?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is prioritizing EUA submissions due to the high volume of applications, which delays most conversion submissions for de novos or 510ks.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Will the priority for EUA submissions delay the FDA's ability to process conversions to de novos or 510ks?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Because of the large volume of EUA submissions that I mentioned, you know, at the top of this call, we're getting 160 new applications roughly a month still at this time period. Our focus in the COVID sphere is to get as many EUA authorizations out as possible and to have a timely review of all EUA submissions. And, you know, I think at the point where those submissions start to trickle off perhaps at some point, that's going to be a more ideal time to encourage conversions. Because right now our focus for the COVID application is on EUAs. And we would probably put on hold most, if not all, conversion submissions. It doesn't mean we won't get to them.

#### 8. Navigating FDA Delays for De Novo Submissions

QA Block 8-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: When can we submit this Q-Submission for a de novo software as a medical device?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA suggests you can proceed with submitting the pre-submission as recommended. Processing times may exceed pre-pandemic timelines due to workload, and FDA will provide a time estimate upon submission.
VERBATIM QUESTION: When can we submit this Q-Submission for a de novo software as a medical device?
VERBATIM ANSWER: You can continue to submit the pre-sub following our recommendations. I guess it was 120 days. If our staff have capacity when it comes back in, we can try to address that. And if we do take it up, in all likelihood it's not going to meet our pre-pandemic timelines that we were holding ourselves to and our office was highly successful in meeting our MDUFA timelines. But with this workload, we're doing our very best. But those non-COVID files that we pick up are going to obviously move more slowly. When you submit, we will, of course, respond in some way telling you what our current situation is and giving you our best time estimate on when we maybe can get to it or further instructions.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Is there any light at the end of the tunnel for non-COVID tests like flu tests, given the workload?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The challenge we have is we have begun putting on hold full MDUFA submissions, full regular non-COVID submissions. And as I just explained, we probably would start - if we start to see a high volume of COVID transition, you know, to full submission, we would more than likely have to put them on hold. And we have put over 100 regular non-COVID submissions on hold right now. And that is weighing on us. We want to get back to them as soon as possible. So what we have done is the surge did not move all reviewers of IVD products into COVID, but it certainly put a large number there. But we are continuing to review some MDUFA full applications. Those that we don't put on hold, unfortunately due to the workload that we have, those MDUFA files in most cases will move forward more slowly. We have, you know, tried to come back to those MDUFA files as soon as possible. You can continue to submit the pre-sub following our recommendations. I guess it was 120 days.

QA Block 9-7
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is referencing the labeling of an FDA-authorized neutralizing antibody test an acceptable approach for developing comparable tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA has authorized one neutralizing antibody test, and referencing its labeling is an acceptable approach for developing comparable tests. Additionally, more guidance can be obtained by contacting the FDA's templates email.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is referencing the labeling of an FDA-authorized neutralizing antibody test an acceptable approach for developing comparable tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So we have authorized to my knowledge one neutralizing antibody test. You can look to that labeling and see if it matches up with your test. So that would be a good, you know, something to follow. It's our current stated public, you know, thoughts in essence around neutralizing antibodies. And, again, we do have more extensive thoughts that if someone emails us to the template's email address and asks for our current thinking on neutralizing assay validations and recommendations, our review staff can now provide that with up-to-date thinking on that.

#### 10. FDA Resource Allocation and Extended Review Timelines

QA Block 10-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the FDA anticipate any additional reallocation of resources beyond the 90 days originally attributed to the EUA process?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA is experiencing a high volume of applications and may extend the 90-day holds. Any extensions will include a timeline for reviewer assignment. However, usual performance in MDUFA turnaround times cannot be guaranteed.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA anticipate any additional reallocation of resources beyond the 90 days originally attributed to the EUA process?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The large volume of applications we're still receiving is a little bit unexpected perhaps. But we were hoping for more trickle than this. And so some files are coming off hold. You're talking about regular non-COVID submissions. I know of a handful that have now started coming off hold. That will continue but it won't necessarily be a large volume. So we, on a rolling basis, will be providing updated information. And if someone has been held, say, for 90 days and they're getting notified again, the next phase of notifications if they've been held the full 90 days will be more definitive as to when - by when they will receive a reviewer. So we may have some extension of holds, but the second round of extensions will have a time commitment for when you will receive a reviewer and the review will begin. But as I've said earlier in the call, we cannot promise our usual good performance on MDUFA turnaround times in this current situation. We'll do our best, but we can't promise anything.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can we consider a breakthrough request for a de novo device with novel technology?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA can consider a breakthrough request for a de novo device with novel technology if it qualifies, and the agency is meeting its breakthrough review timelines for non-COVID submissions.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can we consider a breakthrough request for a de novo device with novel technology?
VERBATIM ANSWER: In the case of something that is a de novo, you can consider a breakthrough request. If it is a novel technology and they qualify for a breakthrough we are meeting our breakthrough review timelines. We are meeting our IDE submission timelines. So we have not stopped handling breakthrough requests for non-COVID. We're not encouraging breakthrough requests for COVID because they are EUAs and we're already trying to work fast to get the authorization on those. But for non-COVID submissions such as this, that would be de novo and may likely fall into a breakthrough category that we can consider.
