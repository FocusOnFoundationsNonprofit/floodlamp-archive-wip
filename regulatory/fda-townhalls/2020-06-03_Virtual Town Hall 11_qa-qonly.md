#### 2. Guidance for COVID-19 Serological Assay 510K Submissions

QA Block 2-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is there an FDA guidance regarding a pathway for a 510K for serological assays?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends using the pre-submission (or Q-sub) process to clarify pathways for 510K submissions for serological assays. Initial tests under routine authorization typically go through de novo classification, with subsequent submissions eligible for 510K. Developers are advised to seek documented feedback from the FDA during this process.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is there an FDA guidance regarding a pathway for a 510K for serological assays?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The first type of test that comes through for COVID or sorry, COVID-19 and SARS CV-2 that comes to us for our routine normal authorization will of course likely be a de novo and likely be classified as Class 2 with special controls. So that means the first one comes through the de novo, the subsequent ones would come through with 510K. We are going to follow our usual and routine manner in processing these when they are converted to a normal submission from EUA submission and include our normal expectations from performance evaluation all of the clinical and analytical studies and all the ancillary requirements of those submissions. We are recommending or we are suggesting I mean it's very wise to come in with a pre-sub or a Q sub especially in the early stages or in - for those who are coming in first. That is a process by which Q subs or a pre-submission process NWX-FDA OC and there's a link on our Web site that perhaps if it's not already on one of our related Web sites we can post it up there so that it's really easy for developers to see this. So the process is first of all it's not required but it is obviously probably a very wise thing to do because to just study or ask questions for this normal submission process. And then that will go into the experts on our team and we'll assess those questions or our protocols and provide very specific and timely feedback back to the developers. So I think even for you who are advising others and are trying to learn about this I think that's a useful way for you to approach us as well. But then we just use specific documented feedback that it's our practice to adhere to that once we've given written feedback back to a sponsor or somebody who comes in with a question you have that documented and established with us so that you can rely – you can have good assurance or expectation that you can rely on that information that we provide in a written form.

We would want that all either low positive patients who get pooled, the samples get pooled by one of a number of potential schemes are not missed in the pooling of samples. And then as you go forward in the validation process you test that that is the case with at least significant - a minimum number of samples that you know that you have good assurance that you're getting accurate testing and you're not having false negatives in a pooling situation within some statistical margin. And so those are kind of some of the details that we're working on to be able to provide to the community.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Why aren't we resulting any kind of inefficient testing with the same presumptive negative for results as the Abbott ID NOW?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA uses presumed negative language in the instructions for use for antigen tests and molecular tests that perform below set expectations. Tests with sensitivity below 95% (for molecular tests) or 80% (for antigen tests compared to high-sensitivity molecular tests) will include this language in their authorization.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Why aren't we resulting any kind of inefficient testing with the same presumptive negative for results as the Abbott ID NOW?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes actually OUR direct antigen test if they are below the expectation for a molecular test we'll have and do have the same language in the ISU. if you look to the ISU in the direct antigen test that they've authorized it is the presumed negative language is there. And so our expectation is that for any test that directly detects virus whether it be protein or nucleic acids that if it's below the expectation for a molecular test which we set the bar at 95% for a comparison to another molecular test if it's below that level our current thinking is that it's best to be a presumed negative. And when we authorize our tests, we will ensure that that language is in the instructions for use and that it's clear to all who might consider using that test. And as we did with the Abbott ID NOW it's already been distributed and we updated for public health purposes we will announce it in formats like this that we have updated it that it was also a press release but this sort of updates to the Abbott ID NOW with - was going to be forthcoming.

#### 9. Developing Laboratory Tests Using Next-Generation Sequencing

QA Block 9-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Where can I find information related to developing a laboratory-developed test using next-generation sequencing?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends using their molecular template for lab-developed tests (LDTs) as a starting point for next-generation sequencing tests. The template provides performance expectations, such as at least 95% sensitivity, and further guidance on authorization. Developers are encouraged to survey mutation sequences and contact FDA with questions via the provided template email address.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Hi. Thank you very much for this town hall. My question is where would I find information related to developing a laboratory-developed test using next-generation sequencing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: That's a great question. We know that that technology is kind of forward and that it's going to be a tremendous help in this battle because we will be able to — you will be able to - presumably you'll share it with others. Just note whether the sample positive or negative for SARS-CoV-2 but also the sequence information instead ends up being important. And we would urge anybody who is collecting sequence information from SARS-CoV-2 we put this in the typical areas so that developers included to survey the sequence information and keep track of the mutations just in case those mutations might occur in unintelligible and the unintelligible. So the recommendations are likely to be very similar to the current molecular recommendation for LDT. We expect that the performance be established on actual patient sample that the performance being very high, at least 95% sensitivity. NWX-FDA OC We're not sure that's the developers but if you're interested in that shoot it to — and developers necessarily have to go into extreme detail elevation of the sequence. And likely will have authorization around the liability of their sequence. We see this technology as being able to provide an accurate positive/negative result for SARS-CoV-2 and in addition provide sequence information as wanted and desired by those who run the testing or who order the testing. But better expectations for the performance would be no less than the net for any other molecular test and for our molecular template for LDT it's a really great place to start. If you see anything missing and other questions about what's the rare opportunity email, I sent a template email address. But we are absolutely seeing developers interested in this area and as required or as helpful we will update the molecular template for MDS sequencing.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What level of statistical validation does the FDA expect to ensure that pooling does not result in false negatives?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is closely monitoring pooling situations and plans to release recommendations soon. Validation for pooling must demonstrate accurate testing, ensuring no low-positive samples are missed, with false negatives minimized within certain statistical margins. Labs must validate using a sufficient sample size to ensure reliability.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What level of statistical validation does the FDA expect to ensure that pooling does not result in false negatives?
VERBATIM ANSWER: When it comes to pooling, we are looking at the situation very closely. For our – we are going to have some recommendations coming up hopefully in the very near future on validation for pooling to provide some more granularity. The bottom line that we're interested in is accurate testing even in the pooling situation. We would want that all either low positive patients who get pooled, the samples get pooled by one of a number of potential schemes are not missed in the pooling of samples. And then as you go forward in the validation process you test that that is the case with at least significant - a minimum number of samples that you know that you have good assurance that you're getting accurate testing and you're not having false negatives in a pooling situation within some statistical margin. And so those are kind of some of the details that we're working on to be able to provide to the community. Of course our current – and so we're working on that as we speak and we hope that gets out in a short amount of time. And I know that we've had a number of inquiries on this and we're trying to do our best to ensure that accurate testing is able to take place. We know that there is a number of folks that are interested in this and we have engaged in some dialogue with folks about, you know, how they go about validating this and being able to have a EUA authorization for it.

And so those are kind of some of the details that we're working on to be able to provide to the community. Of course our current – and so we're working on that as we speak and we hope that gets out in a short amount of time. And I know that we've had a number of inquiries on this and we're trying to do our best to ensure that accurate testing is able to take place. We know that there is a number of folks that are interested in this and we have engaged in some dialogue with folks about, you know, how they go about validating this and being able to have a EUA authorization for it.

REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 9-10
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What measures can developers take to ensure proper validation and avoid pitfalls when using blood samples for NGS?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA requires validation data specifically for blood-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) before authorization. Validation must ensure at least 95% positive agreement with an authorized molecular test to prevent pitfalls.
VERBATIM QUESTION: IMPLICIT
VERBATIM ANSWER: And I was referring to typical respiratory specimens. And so we would like to see prior to you launching this tested data on blood and get the specific authorization out. We also want to test the respiratory samples for MDS NWX-FDA OC and follow the typical notification pathway for LDT but also we want to make sure that there's accuracy on the blood. We have not authorized a blood base NGS So this would be something that we work through together to make sure that the proper validation is done so that we know the accurate testing is done in particular pitfalls are prevented. And our expectation for this kind of test would be that it would give 95% positive agreement with another molecular test that's been authorized.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
