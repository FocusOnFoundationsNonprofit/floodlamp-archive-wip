#### 1. FDA's Transition Plan for COVID-19 Diagnostic Test EUAs

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the time frame for HHS withdrawing the public health emergency for COVID-19?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA cannot predict when HHS will withdraw the COVID-19 public health emergency. EUAs remain effective unless revoked or until the emergency ends, which historically has often taken significant time. The FDA has issued draft guidance on transition plans for EUA devices and encourages stakeholders to provide comments for clarity.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the time frame for HHS withdrawing the public health emergency for COVID-19?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So we can't anticipate when the public health emergency will end. Um we have mentioned previously here on this Town Hall both that we don't know when the emergency will end, and that we are working on a transition plan for devices that are offered under EUA. In December, FDA issued the draft guidance "Transition Plan for Medical Devices Issued EUAs During the COVID‐19 Public Health Emergency," and that is a draft guidance issued for comment. That can be found on our website. Since it is a draft guidance that's been issued for comment, not for implementation, if there are points about the guidance that are unclear, we recommend that you submit a comment to the docket, indicating areas that could benefit from additional clarity. If you have questions specifically about how to manage your current plans for moving forward now with your emergency use test or with a 510k please send an email to the EUA templates mailbox with sufficient details about your specific situation and your specific test so that we can provide appropriate feedback. Additionally, unless revoked, EUAs are in effect until the public health emergency is terminated. This, in previous public health emergencies, has not happened for quite a while, as can be seen by the previous public health emergencies that still have not been terminated, such as Zika and Ebola. And it's important also to note that we have already granted a de novo and cleared a 510k for COVID‐19 molecular tests. And we do welcome additional 510k case submissions for molecular tests. We have not yet granted full marketing authorization for antigen or serology tests, but we are interested in doing so, and a de novo would be the first step for each of those.

#### 2. Omicron Data Requirements for Over-the-Counter Antigen Tests

QA Block 2-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What specific testing for omicron and delta does a developer of an over-the-counter antigen test need to submit if their clinical data predates these variants?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA requires omicron-specific data for EUA review but does not need delta data. Developers can provide clinical study data generated during omicron's prevalence or sequence data confirming samples are omicron. Sequence assays must be validated, and developers may submit at least 10 omicron samples if using banked swabs.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What specific testing for omicron and delta does a developer of an over-the-counter antigen test need to submit if their clinical data predates these variants?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes so we are not asking for any delta specific data. We are asking for omicron data, though, as the FDA variant mutation website says that there could be decreased sensitivity for omicron. And we're wanting to establish performance with omicron, since it's essentially 100% omicron now. Whether the application is currently under review or it's a new application, at this time we do want to see omicron data prior to making our authorization decisions. Let me go into a little bit more detail about what we're looking for here. Talk to your lead reviewer if you've already submitted something. Or you can ask the question in a new submission about what to do. But there are two different pathways that could be utilized here. One is that, since omicron is circulating right now, if you add new clinical study data during a time when omicron is essentially dominant that is good evidence of what the performance will be for omicron. If your application is already in‐house, we may decide if the data looks good, that that sequence confirmation can await a post‐market commitment. But if you're going forward now, we would like to see sequence data. If you haven't started your study or now, I would like to see sequence data in the application showing that the sample is omicron so we know how to establish performance with omicron because we know which samples are omicron. As regards to what sequencing procedure to use, check with the FDA on that one. There are a couple of EUA authorized sequence assays, but, in general, as long as it's a validated sequence as a whole genome sequence assay with good performance, and you can show that to the FDA, that should be sufficient for confirmation that the sample is omicron. There's an alternate pathway. If you should happen to have banked dry swabs for omicron, or even swabs collected only in saline, we can consider this. For those that have applications before the FDA right now, we would ask that a minimum of 10 samples that represent omicron be submitted for our review prior to authorization. I think that's pretty extensive feedback on that, so we'll let that go for now with that.

REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 2-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the FDA's policy on submitting clinical data for emerging variants not yet covered in previously submitted data?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA does not require delta-specific data but requests omicron data due to potential decreased sensitivity. Developers may submit new clinical study data during the dominant omicron wave, validated sequencing data, or a minimum of 10 omicron samples if an application is in progress.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the FDA's policy on submitting clinical data for emerging variants not yet covered in previously submitted data?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We are not asking for any delta specific data. We are asking for omicron data, though, as the FDA variant mutation website says that there could be decreased sensitivity for omicron.

#### 9. Submitting Enrichment Protocols for FDA Pre-EUA Review

QA Block 9-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can we use enrichment procedures to target positive cases during a clinical evaluation study?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA requires that any enrichment protocols be reviewed before use to ensure no bias is introduced, such as knowing comparator test results or swab collection order. Without prior review, data might be unusable.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can we use enrichment procedures to target positive cases during a clinical evaluation study?
VERBATIM ANSWER: OK, so with all enrichment procedures, we do ask that the test developer firm reach out to the FDA and review the enrichment protocol so that any bias is avoided. One of the biases is knowing the results of a comparator test at the time that they are testing. The other potential bias is introduced if a health care collection, a swab collection, is performed prior to the patient doing the self‐collection and sampling. And so we just want to understand all those potential biases, control them in an acceptable way. And it's best before doing such procedures to check with the FDA review staff. Because we have, in some cases, unfortunately, firms didn't do that and they introduced unacceptable bias. And we were, therefore, not able to use the data. And that's a shame. So yes, understand that in some areas, omicron has fallen to very low levels or much lower levels than before. 5% is maybe still a little high to my liking from a public health standpoint, but I understand it does introduce additional challenges to getting the 30 positives that we asked for in the testing. Hope that's helpful, thank you.

VERBATIM ANSWER: That's our current, preferred status. There's hundreds of tests out there. So maybe one still has a presumptive result that hasn't been addressed yet. But I think our preference right now would be to get rid of that presumptive result. For instance, in one case, there was an E‐gene target that had some cross‐reactivity with SARS 1. And so, at first, there was a question, well gosh, what if there is SARS 1 circulating with SARS 2? Clearly, that question has been answered. There is no circulating SARS 1. So that particular assay was addressed with regard to presumptive. I'm not sure of the exact case you're talking about. But again, we can discuss this within the context of pre‐EUA and give you more detailed feedback.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What criteria should be used to determine if a comparator test is acceptable for a specific study?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends using a high-sensitivity central lab molecular assay with CT results and checking with the FDA to confirm if the comparator is acceptable. Developers are advised to consult through a pre-EUA process or with their lead reviewer for detailed guidance.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What criteria should be used to determine if a comparator test is acceptable for a specific study?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We do recommend that you use a high‐sensitivity central lab molecular assay that provides CT results. We also recommend that you check with the FDA to make sure that the comparator test is acceptable. I'm not aware of a test that provides the output that you're describing among our authorized central lab molecular tests. But Kris or Toby may have additional details. But if so, it's an EUA‐authorized test and it has these outputs.

#### 14. Authorization Process and Review Times for Antigen Tests

QA Block 14-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can you provide an indication of how many over‐the‐counter and waived antigen tests are currently in the queue for authorization?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA does not provide numbers on how many tests are in the queue. They aim to review applications as quickly as possible, particularly if applications are clear, accurate, and follow FDA recommendations. Programs like ITAP provide a streamlined process with decisions made very quickly after data is submitted.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can you provide an indication of how many over‐the‐counter and waived antigen tests are currently in the queue for authorization?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah, so that information‐‐ first of all, thank you for your kind words and for your wishes that this pandemic will come to an end soon. I keep on hoping. So you know we don't give those kinds of numbers out. We endeavor to review applications as soon as possible. And those applications that come in, and there's no questions, right? Everything's laid out correctly and accurately and easily understood and read and follow the FDA recommendations on all accounts or checked in with the FDA if they wanted to change anything before doing their studies. And so we preset what's acceptable for the particular developer. Then those applications go through very quickly. Anything that has any significant questions does slow down the review. And so the reviewers have to prepare responses and questions. And then the firms need to receive that and respond to those questions. And the FDA reviewers have to look at those responses and see if they're acceptable. So those kind of back‐and‐forths after submission does have a tendency to significantly delay our review times for them. But, for example, you know we've now got the ITAP program. And because everything's laid out crystal clear in the ITAP program about how things are done, you know when we get a submission through the ITAP program, all those things have been preset. And we make our decision within hours of receipt of the final bit of data from the ITAP program.

#### 16. Requirements for App-Based OTC COVID Test Authorization

QA Block 16-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is needed to add an app to authorize OTC COVID tests when the app provides instructions for running the test and interpreting the test results, and also takes a picture of the test only for recording purposes?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: To add an app for OTC COVID tests, include it in addition to physical instructions provided with the test kit, as not all users may access electronic resources. Collaborate with the test developer to ensure compatibility and independently verify performance for apps interpreting test results. Before proceeding, review FDA templates for guidance and consider submitting a pre-EUA if there are questions or deviations from the guidance.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is needed to add an app to authorize OTC COVID tests when the app provides instructions for running the test and interpreting the test results, and also takes a picture of the test only for recording purposes?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So an app that provides instructions is oftentimes helpful and would be in addition to the recommended physical instructions that come with a kit cause not all users have access to electronic communications or this app. So to be used in addition to an acceptable hard copy that comes with the kit. That's fine. It's recommended that the firm that developed or is developing the test be involved as it will be specific for their test. And then, as far as snapping a picture and interpreting the test results, again, those are features that the FDA is open to and I believe has authorized already. And again, it would be for development with a specific test. Along with that test developer, we will want to see how the application that reads the result independently verify its performance. And so if you're giving the users of that test the option of manually reading or reading through the app, we would want to understand the performance independently of a manual read. So that does involve more work. I would recommend that you send a pre‐EUA if you look at our instructions for app development in the templates, and you still have questions, or you want to alter the recommendations we have.

#### 18. Defining High Throughput for Serology Tests

QA Block 18-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the definition of high throughput as it relates to serology tests in the November 15 guidance?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The guidance does not include a firm definition of high throughput for serology tests. However, a footnote example for molecular tests—two 384-well thermocycler runs per eight hours—is generally applicable and similar throughput should be expected for serology tests.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the definition of high throughput as it relates to serology tests in the November 15 guidance?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah, thanks for that question. And I'm pulling up the guidance right now. We didn't include a firm definition. We included an example as you mentioned in one of the footnotes for molecular. And the intent was that that example would be applicable throughout. So while the exact example is talking about equipment that is used for molecular, the quantity if you will is generally applicable. So I think this is the footnote that says two 384 well thermocycler runs per eight hours. And so you would expect similar throughput for serology tests.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA does not require IRB authorization for EUA reviews, though it is recommended to protect firms and test developers. For non-EUAs, there are expectations around IRB authorization.
VERBATIM QUESTION: For a molecular device intended for at-home use and potentially point-of-care, is it necessary to have a Principal Investigator oversee the studies even if such oversight is not typical for home-use and point-of-care settings?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So IRB authorization is the firm's responsibility. And we're not checking them for EUAs. But it is good to do to protect your firm and the test developers in case of any injuries. We know of reports to poison control, for example, of kids ingesting some of the reagents in the kits. And so these kits in the home are not always totally benign. But we do not check IRB status for our reviews for EUAs. We do have expectations for non‐EUAs. It's a different question.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is needed to add an app to authorize OTC COVID tests when the app provides instructions for running the test, interprets the test results without user input, and also takes a picture of the test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: To authorize an app for OTC COVID tests, the app must complement the physical instructions provided with the kit. It is recommended to involve the test developer, and for apps that interpret results, the FDA requires independent verification of its performance compared to manual reading. You should consult FDA templates and consider submitting a pre‐EUA for further guidance.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is needed to add an app to authorize OTC COVID tests when the app provides instructions for running the test, interprets the test results without user input, and also takes a picture of the test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So an app that provides instructions is oftentimes helpful and would be in addition to the recommended physical instructions that come with a kit cause not all users have access to electronic communications or this app. So to be used in addition to an acceptable hard copy that comes with the kit. That's fine. It's recommended that the firm that developed or is developing the test be involved as it will be specific for their test. And then, as far as snapping a picture and interpreting the test results, again, those are features that the FDA is open to and I believe has authorized already. And again, it would be for development with a specific test. Along with that test developer, we will want to see how the application that reads the result independently verify its performance. And so if you're giving the users of that test the option of manually reading or reading through the app, we would want to understand the performance independently of a manual read. So that does involve more work. I would recommend that you send a pre‐EUA if you look at our instructions for app development in the templates, and you still have questions, or you want to alter the recommendations we have.
