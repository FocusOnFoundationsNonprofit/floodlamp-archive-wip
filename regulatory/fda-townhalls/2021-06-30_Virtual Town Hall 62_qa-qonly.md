#### 1. Developing and Validating SARS-CoV-2 Diagnostic Tests: Updates and Guidance

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What type of study is required to demonstrate matrix equivalency for a proprietary assay buffer compared to viral transport media (VTM)?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends conducting a matrix equivalency study by testing assay performance in both VTM and the proprietary assay buffer at the same target levels across simulated and natural matrices. If equivalency is shown between sample types, an LOD analysis is acceptable, and repeating other validation studies is generally not needed.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What type of study is required to demonstrate matrix equivalency for a proprietary assay buffer compared to viral transport media (VTM)?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Generally, the matrix equivalency study should be performed to compare the assay performance in the VTM and the proprietary assay buffer. So, we would recommend testing be performed in parallel at the same target levels in both simulated and naturally occurring matrices. And to demonstrate equivalency, you should observe the expected proportion of positive results at each target level in both sample types. The LOD can serve as an acceptable matrix study, and if determined to be equivalent, repeating the other validation studies should not be needed in most cases.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: Matrix equivalency study, Proprietary assay buffer, EUA submission
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is a limit of detection analysis sufficient to demonstrate matrix equivalency?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: An LOD analysis can be sufficient for matrix equivalency if the assay performance shows equivalency in expected positive results at each target level across both simulated and natural matrices; repeating validation studies is usually not necessary in such cases.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is a limit of detection analysis sufficient to demonstrate matrix equivalency?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Generally, the matrix equivalency study should be performed to compare the assay performance in the VTM and the proprietary assay buffer. So, we would recommend testing be performed in parallel at the same target levels in both simulated and naturally occurring matrices. And to demonstrate equivalency, you should observe the expected proportion of positive results at each target level in both sample types.

QA Block 1-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: If matrix equivalency is demonstrated, do all validation studies need to be repeated?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: If matrix equivalency is demonstrated through testing at the same target levels using parallel samples, and the expected results are observed, repeating other validation studies is generally not required.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If matrix equivalency is demonstrated, do all validation studies need to be repeated?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So, generally, the matrix equivalency study should be performed to compare the assay performance in the VTM and the proprietary assay buffer. So, we would recommend testing be performed in parallel at the same target levels in both simulated and naturally occurring matrices. And to demonstrate equivalency, you should observe the expected proportion of positive results at each target level in both sample types.

QA Block 1-13
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the requirements for using fresh positive and negative samples in validation studies for antigen tests using banked samples?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA requires a minimum of five fresh positive samples, along with associated fresh negative samples, in validation studies of antigen tests using banked samples. Fresh negatives are expected to be easy to obtain. The rest of the fresh positives can be included in a post-authorization study.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the requirements for using fresh positive and negative samples in validation studies for antigen tests using banked samples?
VERBATIM ANSWER: And I would just add that this is kind of a little bit of a special case, but, you know, where banked samples are used for central lab test validation, it's always been acceptable for molecular tests, for specific potential issues with antigen tests. And we want to work through that. So, but the same thing goes for point of care. So, we are accepting banked samples for point-of-care and for molecular. Typically, we would like you to use whatever buffer remains in your actual test, if there is going to be a transport buffer. Just kind of bridging study about cross-validation is perhaps a special case. We do know that using banked samples and banked positives, is going to be important for many, now that test positivity rate in the US is going down. And still, say an antigen point-of-care test, you know, we would like to see and we've done this before, in fact, the first antigen authorization was allowed completely banked samples VTM frozen, but we also recommended that they do at least five positive fresh samples demonstrating, you know, good results on those five prospective fresh samples. And the intervening negatives that happen with the collection of those fresh positives or fresh negatives and fresh positives, we expect that fresh negatives are going to be easy to obtain. And - but, you know, a complete data set on using bank samples, particularly for antigen tests, is good to establish performance. We just want to see those five - a minimum of five fresh positives, and then the remainder of the fresh positives will be placed into a post-authorization requirement study.

#### 2. Guidelines for Antigen Studies and International Point-of-Care Data

QA Block 2-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are any countries excluded from point-of-care studies based on their variants?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA allows the inclusion of data from countries outside the US if the point-of-care operators and settings are demonstrated to be representative of those in the US. Instructions must be in English, which could exclude countries where English is not a primary language.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are any countries excluded from point-of-care studies based on their variants?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So, it is correct. We have previously stated that it may be acceptable to use data from outside of the US. However, we would want to see that the sponsor has demonstrated that the point-of-care operator in the OUS setting is adequately representative of a point-of-care operator here in the US. This could be done by providing a detailed protocol describing how the proposed setting and intended users represent the point-of-care sites and users in the US. We would want to see that the instructions for use are in English, and provided in English to the point-of-care operator to perform the testing. So, that may present a challenge in countries where English is not the primary language. But we would recommend that the sponsor submit a pre-EUA that includes a detailed protocol, including details on the site users' educational background, professions, et cetera, to demonstrate comparability or representability of a US point-of-care site.

REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 2-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can previously frozen samples be used for point-of-care studies as long as a freeze-thaw study is performed?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Previously frozen samples can be used for point-of-care studies if a fresh vs. frozen study demonstrates similar test performance, the samples are prospectively collected with thorough documentation, and supplemental banked specimens are integrated into daily workflows rather than batch testing. Post-authorization studies with freshly collected samples are also generally expected.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can previously frozen samples be used for point-of-care studies as long as a freeze-thaw study is performed?
VERBATIM ANSWER: And regarding previously frozen samples, we have previously discussed incorporating archived specimens into your validation. We would want to see that the testing is performed on your device in the point-of-care settings with the intended users, and that the supplemental banked specimens should be integrated into the daily workflow of each user, rather than included as batch testing. We would want to see that the archived specimens were prospectively collected, and have a documented history of previous test results, including all test dates. And we would also want to see that there is well-documented information on the storage conditions of the samples from the time of collection. And then also, as previously discussed, a fresh first frozen study should be performed to demonstrate that the test has similar performance with both fresh and frozen specimens. And then we would generally also expect a post-authorization study using freshly prospectively collected samples, if frozen samples are used for the pre-authorization study.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)

QA Block 2-7
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Why does the FDA require instructions for use (IFU) to be in English for studies using point-of-care operators?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA requires IFUs in English to ensure point-of-care participants can effectively follow instructions and to evaluate the English version of the IFU as part of the test. Participants must be fluent in English, and local language translations are not recommended.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Why does the FDA require instructions for use (IFU) to be in English for studies using point-of-care operators?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We would want to see that the instructions for use are in English, and provided in English to the point-of-care operator to perform the testing.

But we would recommend that the sponsor submit a pre-EUA that includes a detailed protocol, including details on the site users' educational background, professions, et cetera, to demonstrate comparability or representability of a US point-of-care site. And then back for the topic on rest-of-world studies for point-of-care. We recognize this isn't necessarily a preferred method, because we really like to see how it works in the US for US authorizations. But we know, because of the low positivity rate, that it's very challenging to collect samples quickly enough, positive samples quickly enough in the US. In regards to the English IFU, I also want to clarify that if users are not fluent in reading and understanding English, that's not an acceptable participant in the study. We've seen some sponsors for some point-of-care even home use instruments and tests that have provided local language translations of the IFU that are used primarily by users. And that has not - and that is not something that we recommend. We are testing the English language IFU as part of the test. And so, it does need to be with folks who understand English.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What conditions must archived specimens meet to be integrated into the daily workflow for point-of-care testing?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Archived specimens must be used in point-of-care settings with intended users, integrated into daily workflow, not batch testing. They must be prospectively collected with a documented history of prior test results and storage conditions. Fresh vs. frozen performance studies are required, and a post-authorization study is expected if frozen samples are used pre-authorization.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What conditions must archived specimens meet to be integrated into the daily workflow for point-of-care testing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We would want to see that the testing is performed on your device in the point-of-care settings with the intended users, and that the supplemental banked specimens should be integrated into the daily workflow of each user, rather than included as batch testing. We would want to see that the archived specimens were prospectively collected, and have a documented history of previous test results, including all test dates. And we would also want to see that there is well-documented information on the storage conditions of the samples from the time of collection.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA generally requires a post-authorization study with freshly and prospectively collected samples if frozen samples are used for pre-authorization validation. Validation should include testing with intended users in point-of-care settings, integration of supplemental specimens into daily workflows, documentation of sample storage conditions, and a fresh vs. frozen study to compare performance.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is a post-authorization study necessary if frozen samples are used for pre-authorization validation, and what should it entail?
VERBATIM ANSWER: And regarding previously frozen samples, we have previously discussed incorporating archived specimens into your validation. We would want to see that the testing is performed on your device in the point-of-care settings with the intended users, and that the supplemental banked specimens should be integrated into the daily workflow of each user, rather than included as batch testing. We would want to see that the archived specimens were prospectively collected, and have a documented history of previous test results, including all test dates. And we would also want to see that there is well-documented information on the storage conditions of the samples from the time of collection. And then also, as previously discussed, a fresh first frozen study should be performed to demonstrate that the test has similar performance with both fresh and frozen specimens. And then we would generally also expect a post-authorization study using freshly prospectively collected samples, if frozen samples are used for the pre-authorization study.

#### 3. Importance of Symptom Data in Antigen Test Validation

QA Block 3-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can a cohort of banked samples missing the number of days post onset of patient symptoms be used for initial EUA authorization of an antigen test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA requires all data for banked samples, including the number of days post-onset of symptoms, for initial EUA authorization of an antigen test. A cohort missing this information is unlikely to be acceptable.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can a cohort of banked samples missing the number of days post onset of patient symptoms be used for initial EUA authorization of an antigen test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So, generally, while we have indicated that banked samples may be acceptable, we would need to see that all of the data associated with the samples is available. And that does include the number of days post onset of patient symptoms. So, we would not think - we don't think that this data set is likely to be acceptable since it does not have that information.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA associates risks with using banked samples without days post onset data, including skewed sampling and a high proportion of low-positive samples, leading to poor performance sensitivity and comparison issues with antigen tests. Unbiased selection and adequate data are crucial.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What risks does the FDA associate with the use of banked samples without information on days post onset of symptoms?
VERBATIM ANSWER: This is an antigen test question, and one of the challenges of using bank samples that don't have data after onset of symptoms, we do not want developers picking samples based on the CT value. The selection should be unbiased. And if it's unbiased and we don't know the days after the onset of new infection, you can end up with a lot of very low positives, high CT samples, and it will not put your device in good light, if - particularly antigen tests. I just don't - we don't have an expectation that, you know, 80% low positives are going to be able to - or up to 90% or 70% of all positives, from being able to be detected at a sufficient sensitivity. We just don't expect that of the antigen technology. It may be easier for molecularly to do that, but it also puts your molecular device, particularly if it's a point-of-care device, it might be a little bit less sensitive at risk if you use such banked samples. So, we've clearly seen some examples where - of developers and test developers that have gone to bank samples and ended up with a skewed sampling because they don't know the days after testing. And then, you know, they harvest a lot of - too many really for the device to look well in comparison to the test - to the comparator test, because there was an unexpected balance or imbalance in the number of low positives that were included. So that's the danger and risk of using bank samples. And so, it's important for us to know the days for which an antigen test is viable as a test. And so, we need that information.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA considered data from the NIH-funded study to shape recent policies on antigen tests, supporting serial testing every few days for asymptomatic screening without asymptomatic data pre-authorization. However, the study involved just one lateral flow test, and findings may not generalize to all tests.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can someone comment on the NIH-funded study announced today about frequent COVID-19 antigen testing, specifically regarding the claim that antigen tests given every three days are on par with PCR tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, no, exactly. I think this is the full journal and publication of this data. It was out as a pre-print months ago and the data was shared confidentiality with the FDA before the pre-print came out as well. We use that data, which was not done in - always in a traditional FDA study sort of manner, but we used that data to primarily inform our recent policy, which allowed serial testing to support the provision of serial testing, to support an asymptomatic screening claim for authorization without having any asymptomatic data. So that policy was based on that data which was available to us months ago. And so the, basis for our serial testing program for any assay that showed at least an 80% sensitivity PPA in symptomatic individuals, and had a lower bound of the 95% confidence level of at least 70%. And so, we had good indication that the test was performing well enough in symptomatic, and the mitigation for expanding the claim to asymptomatics without pre - without data on asymptomatic individuals prior to authorization, would be an acceptable risk for the agency. So, we allow that. And then we did have a post-authorization commitment by the companies that use this, that they would do a serial testing program after authorization, to demonstrate adequate performance when the - particularly when antigen tests are used in serial testing, two or three tests a week. So, you know, there are several antigen tests that utilize this, and we allow that - and then allowed us to make those tests, rather than prescription home use for those suspected of COVID to authorize them based on that paradigm for an over-the- counter, which also would test asymptomatic individuals as well. So, that particular study was done with only one of the lateral flow tests, and one of them that might be more sensitive to instrumented lateral flow test. And so, we don't know that we can generalize that to all developers as far as basing where those hard decisions only on that study. So, that's our current thinking. Hope that's helpful.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the FDA's guidance on addressing potential mutations or variants that might affect test performance?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA has not identified mutations or variants that significantly affect test performance so far, but there have been isolated cases of test failures due to low-abundance mutations or variants. Clinicians and laboratorians should remain vigilant for false positives and negatives.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the FDA's guidance on addressing potential mutations or variants that might affect test performance?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We're not seeing any mutations or variants yet confirm that are significant risks to test performance, but we have seen individual cases in low abundance mutations or variants where a certain test does fail. And so, it does require clinicians, laboratorians, everybody involved with SARS testing, to keep that in mind that they could have a false positive and false negative.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the implications of testing in low COVID-19 incidence populations regarding false positive rates?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: In low incidence populations, both molecular and lateral flow tests can yield significant numbers of false positives due to the low prevalence of true positives. Extra caution should be taken, and confirmatory molecular tests are recommended to avoid risks such as unnecessary placement in COVID wards.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the implications of testing in low COVID-19 incidence populations regarding false positive rates?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We also said that if you have a very low incidence population, no matter what the test is, molecular or lateral flow, molecular has a little bit better specificity NPA than lateral flow, typically. But in either case, you're going to start to see when the incidences of true positives is low, that you may see significant numbers of false positives. And we've also seen and heard reports that clinicians move positive patients on an initial result in a low incidence environment, into a COVID ward, and that's obviously risky. So, we do ask that everybody involved with testing be aware of that. And if the incidence is low and you have a positive, unless that person is already at increased risk, as they're known to be exposed to a confirmed positive patient, that you consider that it could be a false positive and do a confirmatory test, which we would recommend be a molecular test.

#### 5. Usability Studies for Pediatric and Adult Self-Collection Approvals

QA Block 5-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What does the FDA expect us to do for usability studies for testing populations from two years old to 99 years old?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA expects usability studies to address whether younger patients self-collect or adults collect samples. If younger children self-collect, studies must demonstrate usability for those ages. If adults collect for children under 14 or 13, usability should cover adult collection for children as young as two. The approach depends on claims for self-collection or adult collection.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What does the FDA expect us to do for usability studies for testing populations from two years old to 99 years old?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. So I think what you're saying is, for the younger age groups, what do we expect to see for the usability studies? So, it depends on whether you're going to have younger patients self-collect, or if you're going to have adults collect the sample. So, if you're going to have younger patients, you know, you might be able to go down to grade school ages and have them self-collect. Then we would want to see usability studies that - down to the age group that you're going to say, down to the age that you're going to say they can do it, that we'd like to see usability down to that age and good representation in the kids. If you're going to have adults collect, say kids under 14 or under 13, or if you go the exact top point is, and you want to include, you know, unlimited pediatric patients in your test, then we'd want to see usability of adult collection down to age two. And so, obviously, if you want to get a full pediatric range, you can involve some self- collection of older kids if you want, or it can be all adult collection. But then whatever - say, you know, you don't have a grade two - you need to demonstrate that kids can self-collect down to grade two, then below grade two, you're going to have adult collection and we'd want to see representation that an adult, in a home test situation or, you know, that kind of setting, can safely and adequately collect under usability studies and also in your clinical studies, that the adults can see a plain adequately collect those samples, and those samples are apparently in the usability studies collected well, and in the clinical studies accurately. So, that's a lot of information. It all depends on which route you want to go as far as what claims you want about self-collection for kids or adult collection. That's what we've done for all the authorizations to date. And if there aren't kids included in the study, you can't authorize kids. And of course, in point-of-care situations, we know that clinicians can adequately sample kids. So we're not worried about testing it necessarily in kids, but you shouldn't exclude kids in your clinical study at point-of-care. It's just we don't need to specifically see kids in the point-of-care study, unless there's something unique about your device that makes kids difficult. Hopefully, that's helpful.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: How can usability studies for adult-collected pediatric samples be designed for sufficient representation of different age groups?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA expects usability studies to represent the pediatric age ranges involved. This depends on whether children self-collect (e.g., grade school-aged self-collection evaluated with usability studies for that age group) or are sampled by adults (e.g., adult-collected tests shown usable for children as young as 2). Clinical and usability studies need to demonstrate safe, accurate collection in the proposed setting.

#### 8. Navigating Pre-EUA Processes for Point-of-Care Device Approvals

QA Block 8-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: If the sponsor is already operating under a previously submitted EUA and needs to pivot outside the United States due to a lack of samples, is the pre-EUA the correct process to use?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: If a prospective US study does not yield needed results, contact the same reviewer from the pre-EUA to address the situation. If the technology is new, a pre-EUA is recommended to clarify questions, though it is not required.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If the sponsor is already operating under a previously submitted EUA and needs to pivot outside the United States due to a lack of samples, is the pre-EUA the correct process to use?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So, if you've already filed a pre-EUA for a device, and you're switching to this because you've tried a prospective study in the US and it isn't getting you where you need, I think it's very appropriate to go back to the same reviewer who reviewed your pre-EUA and ask them this question. You just go directly to them. They can just reopen the file, or we open a new file and address that question specifically. For those that we haven't seen the technology yet at all, it's probably best to go through - directly through a pre-EUA process so that we understand the technology and we can address the questions accurately. I know we have - we still have a backlog of EUAs and pre-EUAs. I've made a concerted effort to mention that we need to make good progress on both pre-EUAs and EUAs. The pre-EUAs are not required. And our recommendations in the EUA templates are not required. It's recommended - pre-EUAs are recommended and our templates are recommended validations. The value of the pre-EUA, as you know, just as the value of the Q-sub pre-submission, it reduces the risk to the developer.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the potential risks to a sponsor if they choose not to follow the recommended pre-EUA process for their submission?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The pre-EUA process is not required but is highly recommended to reduce risks for developers. Following it ensures studies align with FDA expectations. Not adhering may result in the need to repeat studies or limited claims, such as failing to obtain a point-of-care designation if conducted improperly. FDA emphasizes preparation to avoid such issues.

The value of the pre-EUA, as you know, just as the value of the Q-sub pre-submission, it reduces the risk to the developer. And the reviewers are still just swamped. So, we're doing our very best. So, developers can do things on risk. And so, it's why we give high-level guidance here on our recommendation. If it's point-of-care, we want to see it exactly mimic the point-of-care situation in the US. That's a busy clinical office practice or a busy ER. It's not a central hospital lab where you pull trained laboratorians off that line and say, oh, test some samples on this point-of-care device. No, that's not testing on folks who aren't trained laboratorians. And we have seen those - without pre - without a pre-EUA, we've seen sponsors say, oh, here's our point-of-care study. And, oh, by the way, we did it in a central lab with central lab trained laboratorians as our point-of-care. You can get a moderate and high complexity claim, but you're not going to get a point-of-care claim. So, that's the challenge. So, if you can get - do a good job on selecting point-of-care sites or home sites, because we've talked about those situations already, this call and many calls, that can reduce your risk if you follow our high-level guidance. But to eliminate, you know, complete risk of having to repeat some study, the pre-EUA process is still the best way that we recommend.

#### 9. Challenges and Efforts in Managing COVID-19 Test Submissions

QA Block 9-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is there anything that can be done better to increase efficiency, transparency, and assistance for developers, especially small businesses, to make innovative methods and tests available during the pandemic?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA has authorized nearly 400 tests and prioritized diagnostic, home-based, and high throughput tests. They reallocated staff to address COVID-19 review backlogs but faced limitations due to unprecedented application volumes and lack of increased staffing.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is there anything that can be done better to increase efficiency, transparency, and assistance for developers, especially small businesses, to make innovative methods and tests available during the pandemic?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We're doing our very best. We've authorized almost 400 tests now. And you don't hear about the ones that we don't authorize. And so, we have plowed through a lot more tests than that. And we believe we're doing a great job at meeting the public health need at this point. And with all those cuts authorized and, you know, we have our priorities. We have our priorities, which is point-of-care, particularly diagnostic test point-of- care, and in the home diagnostic tests, and home collections, and high throughput central lab tests. So, those priorities haven't changed, you know, for a very long time. We always assess priorities, and the team is doing the very best they can. We also moved 100 people from other areas recently on to COVID work. That surge - and it was - it had great success in clearing the backlog in many cases for priority reviews. And - but unfortunately, put - it put more than 100 regular non-COVID 510k, de novo and PMA submissions on hold or on pause, not hold, on pause. And that got to be a balance of our resources. So, our office was not staffed, the center was not staffed prior to this pandemic to handle this volume. Our office again, and I'll say it again, in the past year, we typically see just under - we see about 1,900 applications a year. Our office alone receives over 5,500 applications in 12 months, with no substantial increase in staffing, because it takes experts to review this. So, we just had to do it faster and better than we had ever done it before, which I believe the team did. And okay, I think it's time to move on to the next caller.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are banked samples acceptable for use in point-of-care molecular tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA accepts banked samples for point-of-care molecular tests. Ideally, the buffer used should match the one in the test, especially in bridging studies for cross-validation.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are banked samples acceptable for use in point-of-care molecular tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: And I would just add that this is kind of a little bit of a special case, but, you know, where banked samples are used for central lab test validation, it's always been acceptable for molecular tests, for specific potential issues with antigen tests. And we want to work through that. So, but the same thing goes for point of care. So, we are accepting banked samples for point-of-care and for molecular. Typically, we would like you to use whatever buffer remains in your actual test, if there is going to be a transport buffer.

And the intervening negatives that happen with the collection of those fresh positives or fresh negatives and fresh positives, we expect that fresh negatives are going to be easy to obtain. And - but, you know, a complete data set on using bank samples, particularly for antigen tests, is good to establish performance.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Why does biased selection of samples pose a challenge for antigen test validation using banked samples?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Biased selection of samples in antigen test validation, such as picking based on CT values, can result in too many low positives, skewing sensitivity results and not reflecting accurate device performance.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Why does biased selection of samples pose a challenge for antigen test validation using banked samples?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Those banked samples could be used for analytical studies perhaps, if appropriate. This is an antigen test question, and one of the challenges of using bank samples that don't have data after onset of symptoms, we do not want developers picking samples based on the CT value. The selection should be unbiased. And if it's unbiased and we don't know the days after the onset of new infection, you can end up with a lot of very low positives, high CT samples, and it will not put your device in good light, if - particularly antigen tests. I just don't - we don't have an expectation that, you know, 80% low positives are going to be able to - or up to 90% or 70% of all positives, from being able to be detected at a sufficient sensitivity. We just don't expect that of the antigen technology. It may be easier for molecularly to do that, but it also puts your molecular device, particularly if it's a point-of-care device, it might be a little bit less sensitive at risk if you use such banked samples. So, we've clearly seen some examples where - of developers and test developers that have gone to bank samples and ended up with a skewed sampling because they don't know the days after testing.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: For younger age groups, what does the FDA expect to see in usability studies?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA expects usability studies to focus on whether younger patients can self-collect samples or require adult collection. For self-collection, demonstrate usability down to the age being claimed with good representation. For adult collection, ensure safe and accurate collection for children down to age two in both usability and clinical studies.
VERBATIM QUESTION: For younger age groups, what does the FDA expect to see in usability studies?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So, it depends on whether you're going to have younger patients self-collect, or if you're going to have adults collect the sample. So, if you're going to have younger patients, you know, you might be able to go down to grade school ages and have them self-collect. Then we would want to see usability studies that - down to the age group that you're going to say, down to the age that you're going to say they can do it, that we'd like to see usability down to that age and good representation in the kids. If you're going to have adults collect, say kids under 14 or under 13, or if you go the exact top point is, and you want to include, you know, unlimited pediatric patients in your test, then we'd want to see usability of adult collection down to age two. And so, obviously, if you want to get a full pediatric range, you can involve some self- collection of older kids if you want, or it can be all adult collection. But then whatever - say, you know, you don't have a grade two - you need to demonstrate that kids can self-collect down to grade two, then below grade two, you're going to have adult collection and we'd want to see representation that an adult, in a home test situation or, you know, that kind of setting, can safely and adequately collect under usability studies and also in your clinical studies, that the adults can see a plain adequately collect those samples, and those samples are apparently in the usability studies collected well, and in the clinical studies accurately.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Can a point-of-care approved device be used to collect data in usability studies depending on the age group for eventual approval?
VERBATIM ANSWER: No. So we're looking at usability in clinical studies that demonstrate performance in the home type situation. And this just can't be avoided. We need - we make our decisions based on data. And if you only have point-of-care studies, your healthcare sampled patients, healthcare worker sampled patients, and run by the healthcare workers.
