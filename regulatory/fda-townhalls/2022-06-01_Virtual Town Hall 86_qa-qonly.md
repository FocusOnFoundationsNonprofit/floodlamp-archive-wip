#### 3. FDA Guidance on Low Positives in Antigen Test Studies

QA Block 3-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can FDA clarify the positive percent agreement (PPA) requirements for simulated models as shown in performance calculations of certain at-home antigen tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA stated that PPA calculations for data sets with over 20% low positive samples can follow additional recommendations to meet the 10-20% target, but this applies only to OTC SARS-CoV-2 tests under the ITAP program using calibrated RT-PCR comparators, not multi-analyte tests.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can FDA clarify the positive percent agreement (PPA) requirements for simulated models as shown in performance calculations of certain at-home antigen tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, thanks. So data from recent prospective clinical studies with the Omicron variant have shown an unexpectedly high percentage of low viral load samples. We've seen ranges from about 30% to 40% with significantly poor performance with low positive samples compared to high positive samples. Current performance targets are based on a target of 10% to 20% low positives in the clinical study. Where data sets that have more than 20% low positives, we have additional recommendations that can be used to calculate performance within the 10% to 20% target. However, there are caveats to this approach. And so far, it has only been used for SARS‐CoV‐2 tests, OTC antigen tests evaluated by the NIH as Independent Test Assessment Program which is called ITAP. This program uses a study design developed in collaboration with us. These tests all have a similar test design. They use a calibrated RT‐PCR comparator method. And there are other properties of these tests in this program which allow for this type of analysis.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Can the same logic of simulated performance calculation models for at-home antigen tests be applied across influenza A and B data for multi-analyte tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So at this time, this approach is not appropriate for multi‐analyte tests. And really, the approach should be discussed with us after your clinical study is performed and with confirmed Omicron positive samples. And if you have collected more than 20% low positives in your prospective clinical study, then please submit all of your data, including all the low positives. And we can work with you on this new analysis approach.

#### 5. Conducting International Trials for Multi-Analyte At-Home Tests

QA Block 5-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can we conduct a trial in another country, such as China or Colombia, for a multi-analyte at-home test that includes COVID, Flu A, and Flu B?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is open to trials outside the U.S. for multi-analyte at-home tests, particularly for Flu B, which is less common in the U.S. Sponsors should ensure participants primarily speak English or Spanish and must run the trial plan by the FDA in a pre-EUA to address language labeling issues.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can we conduct a trial in another country, such as China or Colombia, for a multi-analyte at-home test that includes COVID, Flu A, and Flu B?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The challenge in some countries is we really need English and/or Hispanic speakers, and Chinese speakers aren't going to‐‐ Chinese‐only speakers aren't going to do for that. And so yes, understand that going outside the U.S. is going to be‐‐ may be necessary for Flu, particularly Flu B. I understand that in the Southern hemisphere, there has been a higher percentage of Flu B right now in the United States. Last I checked it was below 1% of flus in the U.S. So we're open to that. I think before you take an at‐home test to another country for testing, that you run that plan by the FDA in a pre‐EUA just to make sure that the setting on the languages are covered. So one of the things that we've seen with at‐home tests, even non‐COVID tests in foreign countries, is that some sponsors think that they can provide instructions in, say, native language like Chinese in addition to the labeling that would go into the package in the U.S., which is English and/or Spanish primarily. And that's not acceptable to translate into another language. Because we're testing, really, in these studies that the labeling, as well as the tests, all works together in harmony and yields an acceptable result. So testing another language that isn't going to be provided in the U.S. and isn't widely used in the U.S. is not going to be helpful‐‐ so long‐winded answer. But we're open to it if it's‐‐ it's best to run it by us and focus on, I think primarily on our English speakers and readers outside the U.S. if you have to go that route.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are your thoughts on using frozen Flu B samples, such as banked samples, for testing?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: For molecular assays, banked Flu B samples may be feasible but are challenging, particularly for at-home and antigen tests, due to issues like sensitivity changes during freeze-thaw and false positives with transport media. FDA suggests a pre-EUA discussion.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are your thoughts on using frozen Flu B samples, such as banked samples, for testing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: For molecular assays, we're going to have probably an easier time of that. Although, it's not a clear pathway. But banked samples for home is going to be a challenge no matter what. Because you're really testing on the ability of the device to detect. And we have plenty of point‐of‐care flu devices in the United States and central lab tests. So a point‐of‐ care is a little bit easier for molecular assays. But antigen assays are going to be a challenge. But the only way you can do this either frozen direct swab or frozen VTM primarily. And there are issues with each as far as‐‐ we've seen sensitivity changes with a freeze thaw, particularly for antigen tests.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is it necessary to test COVID-19 diagnostic devices with instructions exclusively in English or Spanish for U.S. use?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA requires that COVID-19 diagnostic devices for U.S. use be tested with instructions in English and/or Spanish, as these are the primary languages used. Providing instructions in other languages, like Chinese, is not acceptable as labeling and testing must align closely.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is it necessary to test COVID-19 diagnostic devices with instructions exclusively in English or Spanish for U.S. use?
VERBATIM ANSWER: One of the things that we've seen with at‐home tests, even non‐COVID tests in foreign countries, is that some sponsors think that they can provide instructions in, say, native language like Chinese in addition to the labeling that would go into the package in the U.S., which is English and/or Spanish primarily.

QA Block 5-5
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What factors should be considered when planning pre-EUA discussions for at-home tests to be tested outside the U.S.?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA emphasizes the need to test at-home diagnostics in settings with English or Spanish speakers, not Chinese-only speakers, and suggests discussing the testing plan in a pre-EUA. Translations into other languages unsuitable for U.S. packaging are not acceptable, as labeling and tests must align for valid results.
VERBATIM QUESTION: IMPLICIT
VERBATIM ANSWER: OK. The challenge in some countries is we really need English and/or Hispanic speakers, and Chinese speakers aren't going to‐‐ Chinese‐only speakers aren't going to do for that. And so yes, understand that going outside the U.S. is going to be‐‐ may be necessary for Flu, particularly Flu B. I understand that in the Southern hemisphere, there has been a higher percentage of Flu B right now in the United States. Last I checked it was below 1% of flus in the U.S. So we're open to that. I think before you take an at‐home test to another country for testing, that you run that plan by the FDA in a pre‐EUA just to make sure that the setting on the languages are covered. So one of the things that we've seen with at‐home tests, even non‐COVID tests in foreign countries, is that some sponsors think that they can provide instructions in, say, native language like Chinese in addition to the labeling that would go into the package in the U.S., which is English and/or Spanish primarily. And that's not acceptable to translate into another language. Because we're testing, really, in these studies that the labeling, as well as the tests, all works together in harmony and yields an acceptable result. So testing another language that isn't going to be provided in the U.S. and isn't widely used in the U.S. is not going to be helpful‐‐ so long‐winded answer.

And that has a decision summary in there that has a lot of information related to how that test was validated, both analytically and clinically. And of course, those special controls do cover single‐analyte and multi‐analyte molecular tests. And that would be both in a high‐complexity laboratory and then a moderate complex device. And then if you're going to further extend the claims to CLIA waiver, then that would be kind of a typical CLIA waived approach that has been done numerous times.

#### 9. FDA Guidelines for Test Performance and Multi-Analyte Approaches

QA Block 9-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is the FDA more open to lower performance as indicated by PPAs of 64.2% and 67.1%, and will this be reflected in a template for everyone for minimum performance requirements?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is not lowering its performance bar. The template's expectations for antigen tests include 10-20% positivity, but recent ITAP studies showed higher positivity rates, aligning with acceptable performance. This approach is only applicable to COVID-19.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is the FDA more open to lower performance as indicated by PPAs of 64.2% and 67.1%, and will this be reflected in a template for everyone for minimum performance requirements?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah. So, Kal, thanks for that question. That was covered in pretty good detail at the top of the call. Because we had a pre‐submitted question on this. So I'll just quickly recap. And then you can look to the transcript to get the more details on this. No. This isn't lowering the bar. We see that with the Omicron it's a lot more of low positive and our template says for antigen, it says‐‐ and this is only appropriate for antigen tests‐‐ that we expect to see 10% to 20% antigen test positivity. And then when we're seeing 30% to 40% with the recent ITAP study that was above our expectations. So we modeled‐‐ if you saw the normal previous 10% to 20% and your performance was at an 80% or above and the lower bound was greater than 70%‐‐ was greater than or equal to 70%, then that was the acceptable performance for authorization. We will not apply this to other viruses other than COVID.

#### 11. Monkeypox Testing Policies and Emergency Authorization Guidelines

QA Block 11-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How can local labs enable PCR tests for monkeypox or CDC-type tests for their own validation when there are very few or no positive patient samples?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA states that testing capacity for monkeypox in the U.S. currently exceeds demand through the FDA-cleared CDC assay available at 67 public health labs. For labs needing a path to validation, Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs) may be an option under FDA's enforcement discretion unless there's a declared emergency, in which case testing would require emergency use authorization. A molecular template is being prepared in case of such an emergency.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Regarding this emerging virus bacteria infections, such as monkeypox, and how do we enable the local labs adopting PCR tests, home‐brewed or CDC type of test doing their own validation as there are no or very rare positive cases patient samples?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah. So for the volumes that we're seeing right now for monkeypox in the United States, the CDC and the Association‐‐ the Public Health Lab members of the Association for Public Health Labs, there are, I believe, 67 state and local public health labs that have the FDA‐cleared CDC assay. And the laboratory testing capacity within that public health lab network greatly exceeds the current cases of monkeypox in the United States. At least at the moment, there does not appear to be a need today for a lot more testing capacity. That said, I do want to cover monkeypox in a little bit of detail today. So the availability of emergency use authorization for COVID‐19 tests is available due to the Secretary's declaration under Section 564 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of emergency or threats justifying authorization of emergency use for a product. For tests for viruses that do not have an act of emergency declaration under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, traditional review pathways‐‐ de novo, 510k, PMA are available. The CDC already have, as I said, an FDA‐cleared assay for non‐variola orthopox, which detects monkeypox. And since it's the only non‐variola orthopox circulating in the U.S. potentially right now, that test is perfectly functional to detect any monkeypox cases. And the public health labs know that they can act on those positive results. And there may also be laboratory‐developed tests available for orthopox or specifically for monkeypox, LDTs or Laboratory Developed Tests are tests develop use within a single high complexity CLIA‐certified laboratory. The FDA has generally exercised enforcement discretion for LDTs, meaning that the agency generally does not exercise its authority to enforce the regulatory requirements for these devices. Although, it maintains that authority. The general enforcement discretion policy for LDTs has not applied in limited circumstances, including tests used during declared emergency under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. In the case of an emergency involving an outbreak, inaccurate tests can lead to greater spread of the disease and poor management of the outbreak due to false results. FDA has, therefore, expected emergency use authorization for LDTs during all prior declared emergencies, including the H1N1 in 2009 and continuing through the current COVID‐19 emergency. The FDA is preparing a molecular template for potential use if an emergency were to be declared for monkeypox under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. We will also monitor the situation with respect to appropriate policies for tests in the event of a declared emergency. I'm not saying, however, that there is going to be an emergency. So right now, monkeypox, orthopox is covered under enforcement discretion for LDTs.

#### 12. Sample Stability and Storage Challenges in FDA EUA Testing

QA Block 12-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Would the FDA accept a well-documented validation from a lab to extend the storage conditions for samples and specific VTMs beyond the 72-hour guideline?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA has authorized tests with specific sample stability details. If a test is validated for 72 hours at 2-8 degrees, stability beyond this isn't confirmed. Labs can engage FDA for guidance or conduct additional studies, though it's hoped this won't be necessary.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Would the FDA accept a well-documented validation from a lab to extend the storage conditions for samples and specific VTMs beyond the 72-hour guideline?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So the FDA has authorized EUA tests and/or grants or 510ks with information about a sample transport and sample stability. And if the test has been validated only out to 72 hours at 2 to 8 degrees, we don't know the stability of the samples beyond that. And so if you have any discrepancies in your study because of say delayed testing, that should be noted on the line listings for that patient and that testing. If you have questions about this, if it's a very frequent occurrence, you can engage the FDA either, if you were already working with a reviewer, for the reviewer, or in a pre‐EUA to ask what to do in that situation. Certainly, additional studies could be done to show sample stability for a given EUA. But that's something that we hope doesn't have to be done.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Should laboratories document and note delayed sample testing and its potential effects in patient line listings?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: If delayed testing results in discrepancies, laboratories should document this in the patient line listings.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Should laboratories document and note delayed sample testing and its potential effects in patient line listings?
VERBATIM ANSWER: And if the test has been validated only out to 72 hours at 2 to 8 degrees, we don't know the stability of the samples beyond that. And so if you have any discrepancies in your study because of say delayed testing, that should be noted on the line listings for that patient and that testing.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the FDA provide guidance on how frequently occurring discrepancies related to delayed testing should be handled?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA advises noting discrepancies caused by delayed testing in the patient line listings and consulting the agency if this happens frequently. Additional studies on sample stability can also be conducted.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA provide guidance on how frequently occurring discrepancies related to delayed testing should be handled?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So the FDA has authorized EUA tests and/or grants or 510ks with information about a sample transport and sample stability. And if the test has been validated only out to 72 hours at 2 to 8 degrees, we don't know the stability of the samples beyond that. And so if you have any discrepancies in your study because of say delayed testing, that should be noted on the line listings for that patient and that testing. If you have questions about this, if it's a very frequent occurrence, you can engage the FDA either, if you were already working with a reviewer, for the reviewer, or in a pre‐EUA to ask what to do in that situation.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can a laboratory submit data from frozen samples if these samples are not validated in the EUA instructions, and how should this be communicated prior to submission?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Frozen samples can be used in studies under EUA authorization. If frozen samples are not validated or reported in the EUA test, this must be disclosed in the licensing submission, and it is advisable to discuss this with FDA before submitting the data.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can a laboratory submit data from frozen samples if these samples are not validated in the EUA instructions, and how should this be communicated prior to submission?
VERBATIM ANSWER: And frozen samples should be allowed for these studies as well in the EUA authorization. So if you're using frozen samples where the EUA test does not validate and report use of frozen samples then that's another item that we'll want to know about in your licensing.

#### 13. Evaluating Antigen Test Sensitivity Amid Omicron Challenges

QA Block 13-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is the rethinking of the 80% PPA performance target applicable to just antigen over-the-counter tests, or can it also apply to antigen point-of-care tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Yes, the rethinking applies to antigen tests broadly, and developers can engage the FDA for discussions about point-of-care antigen tests. The adjustments consider the Omicron era's challenges and aim to ensure all antigen tests maintain relative sensitivity standards.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is the rethinking of the 80% PPA performance target applicable to just antigen over-the-counter tests, or can it also apply to antigen point-of-care tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah. You can engage us on that. I mean, it's really our current thinking around antigen tests. So the current template, which has been in place with recommendations for antigen test validation called for there to be 10% to 20% of low positives at a minimum. And we were, up until about January 1 of this year, that was typically what we were seeing in submissions. Sometimes, we didn't see it. And that was a potential red flag if we didn't see low positive. But when we began seeing more and more, significantly more low positives and that directly degraded the overall PPA, it's just we hypothesized that this is a behavior of the virus with Omicron and potentially contributing to lower sensitivity of antigen tests in Omicron. But it would be unfair to hold tests that are being validated in the Omicron era to not take that into account. Because potentially, any previous tests‐‐ had it been validated during this time period, might suffer from the same challenges that we're seeing with these tests. One thing that we do do in the ITAP program is we do make very careful analytical comparisons, analytical sensitivity comparisons between candidate tests and prior authorized tests as a measure of relative sensitivity. So we do know that these candidate devices are at least as sensitive as some other EUA‐authorized tests at the bench level. We also know that some candidate devices on Omicron pools within the ITAP program are falling less sensitive than some of the previously authorized tests. And so that is a challenge for those developers of those tests. Because we are trying to hold the line on overall sensitivity so that these antigen tests continue to‐‐ they're authorized to continue to perform relative to each other, relatively‐equally well.

VERBATIM QUESTION: If we work with the developer of the EUA-approved antigen test and get approval, can this automated instrument only work with that EUA-approved test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah. So you're fully‐supports automating anything that can be automated for the antigen test or any of the tests, including the interpretation. But that obviously, can change the performance of the test. Because it's no longer a manual done process that's been tested in the past. And it's no longer a manual read.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the agency prioritize EUA submissions over 510k submissions for molecular point‐of‐care tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA prioritizes EUA submissions for COVID molecular point-of-care tests that meet the November 15, 2021 guidance, as it is the easier route to market. However, the 510k pathway is available, and developers with long-term goals are encouraged to prepare 510k submissions.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the agency prioritize EUA submissions over 510k submissions for molecular point‐of‐care tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah. So a COVID point‐of‐care and molecular test that meets the November 15th, 2021 guidance of volume minimums will be prioritized for EUA review. So if you meet those stipulations in that November 15th guidance, the EUA pathway continues to be the easiest pathway to get on to the U.S. market with a COVID test‐‐ either COVID alone or COVID along with other viruses. But the 510k pathway is open to you now that we have authorized‐‐ we granted the first de novo for molecular COVID tests and even a follow up 510k. So you have your choice of either. The EUA is going to be a little bit more streamlined path to get onto the U.S. market. We do recommend, though, that the developers consider their long‐term interests as far as whether they want to be on a market long‐term. And if that's true, that everybody begin working on their 510k submissions for molecular tests. And for antigen, the first submissions would be de novos as well as for serology. Hopefully, that answers your question.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can you discuss extending claims to CLIA waiver for moderate complexity devices?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends reviewing decision summaries, like the BioFire RP2 test, which provide information on validation for moderate complexity devices. Extending claims to CLIA waiver requires following the typical CLIA-waived approach, and queries can be discussed in Q-Submissions.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can you discuss extending claims to CLIA waiver for moderate complexity devices?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So you can look into the FDA de novo database and look for the BioFire RP2 test. And that has a decision summary in there that has a lot of information related to how that test was validated, both analytically and clinically. And of course, those special controls do cover single‐analyte and multi‐analyte molecular tests. And that would be both in a high‐complexity laboratory and then a moderate complex device. And then if you're going to further extend the claims to CLIA waiver, then that would be kind of a typical CLIA waived approach that has been done numerous times. So we can discuss that in the context of a Q‐ Sub. Or there's also numerous decision summaries available for multiplex upper respiratory infection tests that have been CLIA waived as well.
