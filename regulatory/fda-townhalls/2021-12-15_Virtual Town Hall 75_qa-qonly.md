#### 2. COVID-19 Test Validation and EUA Submission Guidelines

QA Block 2-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can test developers offer their tests if an emergency use authorization (EUA) request is submitted within 60 days of the policy for coronavirus disease 2019?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA permits tests developed by a high-complexity CLIA-certified lab and offered for use before November 15 to remain available while their EUA requests are under review, provided those requests are submitted within 60 days of the updated guidance's posting. For tests developed after November 15, they must receive an EUA before being offered.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can test developers offer their tests if an emergency use authorization (EUA) request is submitted within 60 days of the policy for coronavirus disease 2019?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Thanks, Joe. And I just want to note that this specific question was actually referring to a multi-analyte COVID and flu molecular test. And so I know that question has come up previously. So I want to make sure that we include that note in our response as well. And so generally as described in the updated policy for coronavirus tests, the guidance that was updated on November 15, for tests that were developed by a high-complexity CLIA-certified lab and used only in the lab in which it was developed, so generally an LDT, that were offered for clinical use prior to November 15, the date of the guidance update, FDA does not intend to object to developers offering the tests while FDA reviews the EUA requests, provided the EUA request is submitted to FDA within 60 days of that guidance posting on November 15, and as outlined in the guidance. So there are a lot of details in the guidance about that process. For newly developed and not-yet-offered tests, so those that a lab or other developer might develop after November 15, we do expect those tests to receive an EUA prior to being offered for clinical use.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Joseph Tartal (FDA)

QA Block 2-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Which data stratifications does the FDA require for studies involving symptomatic versus asymptomatic individuals?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA requires recording whether a subject is symptomatic or asymptomatic, along with known exposure status. Data should be stratified accordingly; screening indications consider asymptomatic subjects with no known exposure, while indications for suspected individuals include symptomatic subjects and asymptomatic individuals with known or suspected exposure.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Which data stratifications does the FDA require for studies involving symptomatic versus asymptomatic individuals?
VERBATIM ANSWER: What we recommend is that when you submit-- or when you're doing your studies and then when you submit your data, that you record whether each subject is symptomatic or asymptomatic, as well as whether they have a known exposure or not. And then include your data stratifying by these designations. So generally, if you are seeking a screening indication, so an indication for testing individuals who do not have symptoms or other epidemiological reasons to suspect COVID-19, we would consider your data on subjects who are asymptomatic with no known exposure. On the other hand, for an indication of individuals or for individuals suspected of COVID-19, we would consider data from symptomatic individuals, as well as asymptomatic individuals with a known or suspected exposure.

#### 3. Implementing Device Modifications During FDA EUA Review

QA Block 3-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can manufacturers implement device modifications while the emergency use authorization supplement is under FDA review?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA does not intend to object to manufacturers implementing device modifications while the EUA supplement is under review, provided the test is used in high-complexity CLIA labs and transparency measures are taken.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can manufacturers implement device modifications while the emergency use authorization supplement is under FDA review?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The Section 4D of the policy for COVID tests that was updated on November 15 does also address modifications that were made before and after November 15. There are some slight differences to those policies and the types of modifications for which the FDA does not intend to object to implementation of the modification to the diagnostic test while FDA conducts its review. It's important to note-- and this is discussed in the guidance-- that such tests, the use of those modified tests is limited to use in a high-complexity CLIA lab, since the modified version of the test is not yet authorized. And the guidance also discusses certain measures that a developer should take to provide transparency.

#### 4. FDA Considering OTC Multi-Analyte Tests for Asymptomatic Use

QA Block 4-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Will the FDA consider over-the-counter (OTC) multi-analyte tests for asymptomatic individuals?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is considering a pathway for OTC multi-analyte tests and recommends test developers submit a pre-EUA to discuss their proposals. There are clinical uncertainties around asymptomatic flu test results.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Will the FDA consider over-the-counter (OTC) multi-analyte tests for asymptomatic individuals?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah. So we have previously discussed this on the Town Hall and in other venues. And we've previously indicated that we were not at that time interested in over-the-counter multi-analyte tests. We are now considering whether there is an appropriate pathway for such tests. And we recommend that test developers interested in an over-the-counter multi-analyte test submit a pre EUA to further discuss your proposal. And Toby, I'll just add to that. We still have no idea what an asymptomatic flu test result would mean clinically, if it were even to occur. So perhaps there are folks with data out there. But there are different ways to handle this.

#### 5. Requirements for Laboratory Developed Test EUA Authorization

QA Block 5-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What documents are required to support a Laboratory Developed Test (LDT) EUA authorization?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Test developers, including labs, should use optional EUA templates outlining test indication, description, performance, validation data, and methods. Submissions may also include supporting datasheets via email or meet inclusion criteria for the umbrella EUA. Labs can submit procedures instead of an IFU for single labs, while EUA summaries are published upon authorization.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What documents are required to support a Laboratory Developed Test (LDT) EUA authorization?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So generally, all test developers, including laboratories that are submitting an EUA request, may use the optional EUA templates. Those are provided on our website. And they generally recommend providing information on the indication of the test, a description of the test, the validated performance of the test, a description of how the test was validated, and the validation data. Alternatively, the COVID test guidance discusses for laboratories that they may submit an email, and even the template, the submission does go through an email to the FDA. But the other option is to submit an email to the CDRH EUA template mailbox, with supporting information such as a description of the test and the intended use, and attach existing validation test reports and Excel data files that the lab may already have on file in accordance with their internal procedures. A lab that has developed their own test may also consider whether their test meets the criteria for inclusion in the umbrella EUA for SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostic tests for serial testing. That was issued also on November 15 when we updated the guidance. And we would recommend that laboratories review the criteria included in the EUA letter of authorization for that umbrella EUA. If a laboratory test meets the inclusion criteria and they would like authorization under the umbrella EUA, they just need to follow the instructions in the letter of authorization for submitting information to FDA. And then regarding documentation, for LDTs, which are tests that are designed, developed, and used within a single high-complexity CLIA-certified lab, typically the laboratory developer provides their laboratory procedures to accompany the EUA request in lieu of an IFU, or the instructions for use, that we would typically see with a commercial distributed test kit. Upon authorization, FDA would then post an EUA summary, including information about the tests performance. And this labeling approach may also be used for certain tests developed by laboratories that are distributed and performed in multiple laboratories.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Joseph Tartal (FDA)
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)

#### 7. Priority Review for Automated COVID-19 Test Devices

QA Block 7-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is the Agency willing to review types of tests not listed in the priority guidance but that support patient safety and public health by driving access to high-quality, accessible testing in non-clinical, non-at-home settings?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA encourages submitting a pre-EUA with details for review. Tests intended for use in non-clinical settings, such as schools, may fall into the point-of-care or over-the-counter categories based on their operational requirements and should meet specific criteria.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is the Agency willing to review types of tests not listed in the priority guidance but that support patient safety and public health by driving access to high-quality, accessible testing in non-clinical, non-at-home settings?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah. You'll probably want to send in a pre EUA with details. But to me, it sounded like there was an instrument. And it would operate at a school, and it would return results to individuals. That would more than likely fall under the point-of-care test category to be used in locations that have a CLIA certificate of waiver, or they could be moderate or high complexity. Once we authorize for a point- of-care setting, then they can be used in those settings. Tasks that can be performed entirely by individuals themselves and interpreted by themselves at such locations, such as schools and workplaces, would fall into the over-the-counter category. However, it does need to be a device that can be wholly operated by the subjects themselves and not require more of a laboratory setting, even if it's a CLIA way laboratory. Hopefully that addresses your question enough on this call.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Bridget Bondock
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: priority review for new tests, point-of-care vs OTC tests, non-clinical testing criteria
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 7-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Would the Agency be willing to review a fully automated high-throughput COVID-19 test device for use in settings such as schools or corporate lobbies with self-collected specimens?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA would likely review the test under the point-of-care category if it operates in locations like schools with CLIA waivers or moderate/high complexity. If entirely self-operated by individuals at schools or workplaces, it could fall under over-the-counter category. Developers should submit a pre-EUA with details.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Would the Agency be willing to review a fully automated high-throughput COVID-19 test device for use in settings such as schools or corporate lobbies with self-collected specimens?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah. You'll probably want to send in a pre EUA with details. But to me, it sounded like there was an instrument. And it would operate at a school, and it would return results to individuals. That would more than likely fall under the point-of-care test category to be used in locations that have a CLIA certificate of waiver, or they could be moderate or high complexity. Once we authorize for a point- of-care setting, then they can be used in those settings. Tasks that can be performed entirely by individuals themselves and interpreted by themselves at such locations, such as schools and workplaces, would fall into the over-the-counter category. However, it does need to be a device that can be wholly operated by the subjects themselves and not require more of a laboratory setting, even if it's a CLIA way laboratory. Hopefully that addresses your question enough on this call.

#### 8. Guidance on EUA Modifications and Lab Additions

QA Block 8-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What do we need to do to make changes to add additional laboratory facilities to a previously authorized EUA?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA expects a supplement submission for adding labs, including assurance that the new labs perform tests per the authorization. Since adding labs falls outside the LDT policy update, pre-authorization will likely be required.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What do we need to do to make changes to add additional laboratory facilities to a previously authorized EUA?
VERBATIM ANSWER: For an addition of additional labs, we would expect you to send in a supplement. So we would probably want to see in your submission some information about how you're going to ensure that the other labs are performing the test according to the authorization. Adding an additional lab isn't covered in the updated LDT policy of November 15. So adding that additional lab will probably—because it falls outside this category that we think of as an LDT, as developed in a single lab, and often a single lab. In all likelihood, you're going to want to have authorization before you add that additional lab. But come in with a pre EUA, and we'll confirm that.

#### 10. Lab Test Modifications and FDA Authorization Requirements

QA Block 10-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Would a lab deviating from the IFU regarding PCR instrument, control volume, and transport media be automatically considered an LDT, requiring the lab to submit as an LDT?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA does not automatically consider a test to be an LDT if deviations from IFU occur. However, any significant modifications by a high-complexity CLIA lab must be validated, confirm equivalent test performance, and ensure transparency that the test isn't FDA-authorized.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Would a lab deviating from the IFU regarding PCR instrument, control volume, and transport media be automatically considered an LDT, requiring the lab to submit as an LDT?
VERBATIM ANSWER: If it's not authorized, and you haven't validated it, then that's definitely, definitely in the gray zone, if not further. It's probably best to check with our team. Typically, if a lab modifies, significantly, an EUA authorized device, then there are some modifications that the FDA would like to see. If you take a look at the guidance, it does spell out that there are differences between the policies for commercial manufacturers modifying their test, and a high-complexity CLIA-certified lab modifying an authorized molecular diagnostic. If the lab is modifying the test, and it meets the description in the guidance, so it's not changing the indications for use or the analyte-specific reagents, we would not expect a notification to FDA or a new EUA from the lab, as long as the lab has validated the modification, and confirmed that the performance of the modified test is equivalent to the performance of the authorized test, and the use of that modified test is limited to the high-complexity CLIA lab in which the modification was made.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the FDA require validation data to be submitted prior to implementing modifications such as newer instrument versions, provided there are no changes to indications for use or analyte-specific reagents?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA does not object to implementing newer instrument versions while awaiting EUA amendment review, provided the modifications do not change indications for use or analyte-specific reagents and validation data is submitted in a supplemental EUA request.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA require validation data to be submitted prior to implementing modifications such as newer instrument versions, provided there are no changes to indications for use or analyte-specific reagents?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We would expect-- this would fall under the modification section in the guidance, again. You asked-- I think you said, specifically, implementing newer versions of instruments. That would fall under the policy where we've noted that if it does not change the indications for use or the analyte-specific reagents, so as long as the manufacturer submits their validation data to FDA in a supplemental EUA request, then we would not object to that modification being implemented while FDA reviews. But again, noting what I had said previously about the transparency. And that's all discussed in Section IV D of the guidance.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Do we need to engage with the FDA again for oversight of our testing under current regulations?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Anything that's authorized under the SalivaDirect, and SalivaDirect has authorization, and you follow their protocols, and they have designated you as a SalivaDirect lab, the FDA has authorized SalivaDirect to make those designations, and those labs, performing the procedure as indicated, are covered by the EUA. Any significant modifications would not be covered, as we've previously covered on this call.

Again, if you're doing SalivaDirect, you're following their procedure, you're a designated lab, no EUA is needed. There are States that, early on in the pandemic, we allowed to review tests within their States without requiring FDA review. And those are not EUA-authorized tests. But those States that had been previously designated when the policy was updated on November 15, those states could continue to do that.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: If a lab in Massachusetts is operating under their own LDT without FDA authorization, what specific steps must they take to comply with the November 15 guidance?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Labs in Massachusetts developing their own LDT without FDA authorization must review the November 15 guidance, specifically Section IV.C 2, and submit an EUA request to FDA within 60 days of the guidance issuance.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If a lab in Massachusetts is operating under their own LDT without FDA authorization, what specific steps must they take to comply with the November 15 guidance?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah. I can just add a little bit more there. First, on the States issue. I think you said you were in Boston. Massachusetts is not one of the States listed on our FAQ page as a state that had notified us that they were choosing to authorize labs within their state to develop and perform tests. But we do have information on that policy, both in the FAQs on our webpage, and in the November 15 guidance. From a more general perspective, it sounded like you were saying that you have your own LDT that you're performing with NP swabs, and then you're also performing the SalivaDirect test with saliva samples. As Tim said, the SalivaDirect test is an EUA-authorized test. It is not an umbrella EUA. That has been a point of confusion, so I just want to throw in that clarification. It is an authorized test that is authorized for the protocol to be distributed to labs that SalivaDirect designates to receive their protocol and perform their test. If you are designated by SalivaDirect, and you're performing their test as authorized, as Tim said, that is an authorized test, and there's nothing that you need to do, additionally, for that. For your LDT, if you're performing your own LDT, I would suggest that you take a look at the November 15 guidance document, and, specifically, take a look at Section IV.C. And most likely it's going to be IV.C 2 for you, since you would be considered a test, an LDT, that's being offered without FDA authorization, following the HHS August 2020 announcement. As described in that policy, we would expect you to submit an EUA request to FDA for your LDT within 60 days from the date of issuance of that guidance. I believe 60 days from that is January 14.

#### 13. Submitting Antigen Test: 510(k) or De Novo Pathway?

QA Block 13-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can we submit a premarket submission for an OTC COVID-19 antigen test as a 510k, or would it need to be a de novo?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: A premarket submission for an OTC COVID-19 antigen test would likely need to be a de novo since no antigen tests have yet been granted de novo. Once the first is approved, subsequent tests could be submitted as 510k applications.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can we submit a premarket submission for an OTC COVID-19 antigen test as a 510k, or would it need to be a de novo?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah. We haven't fully authorized-- granted a de novo for an antigen test. Such a submission, in all likelihood, should be a de novo. Once we authorize the first de novo, every subsequent test would be a 510k. In the process of reviewing the first de novo in a category-- we haven't done antigen yet. Serology would be the same boat-- we look at what mitigations are needed to ensure safety to down-classify, to class two, for the device. We put those mitigations in a document called special controls, that all subsequent developers know how to validate, and what factors are important for risk mitigation for that test.

#### 15. Asymptomatic Testing Requirements for EUA Submission

QA Block 15-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the correct interpretation regarding conducting asymptomatic testing without the serial testing portion and discussing it with the assigned reviewer after submitting the EUA?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA emphasizes consulting reviewers on deviations from templates. Serial testing helps when symptomatic data is validated for asymptomatic screening; otherwise, testing must be based on asymptomatic data for single-use screens.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the correct interpretation regarding conducting asymptomatic testing without the serial testing portion and discussing it with the assigned reviewer after submitting the EUA?
VERBATIM ANSWER: I think so. We recommend that anything that doesn't follow the recommendations of the templates, that you check with the FDA before doing so. The serial testing is really to allow developers that have validated their test only on symptomatic individuals, with acceptable performance with the lower bound of the PPA, at least 70%, to be able to offer an asymptomatic screening claim, only with symptomatic data, as long as they instruct users to do serial testing with that test. If the developer wants to avoid the requirement for serial testing, they want a single test for an asymptomatic screen, then we want to see data in the truly asymptomatic population. And please note Toby's comments at the top of the hour, at the top of the meeting, about how we define asymptomatic.

QA Block 15-6
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What steps are required to receive approval for an asymptomatic screening claim without implementing serial testing?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: To avoid serial testing for asymptomatic screening, robust data must be provided using a truly asymptomatic population.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What steps are required to receive approval for an asymptomatic screening claim without implementing serial testing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The serial testing is really to allow developers that have validated their test only on symptomatic individuals, with acceptable performance with the lower bound of the PPA, at least 70%, to be able to offer an asymptomatic screening claim, only with symptomatic data, as long as they instruct users to do serial testing with that test. If the developer wants to avoid the requirement for serial testing, they want a single test for an asymptomatic screen, then we want to see data in the truly asymptomatic population. And please note Toby's comments at the top of the hour, at the top of the meeting, about how we define asymptomatic.

#### 16. Guidance on Using Expired Reagents in Testing

QA Block 16-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can we do a bridging study to use an EUA test that has expired reagents?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA does not recommend using expired reagents for an EUA test. You would need to contact the developer and FDA, but testing using expired reagents would require extensive daily QC testing, which is impractical and not guaranteed by manufacturers.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can we do a bridging study to use an EUA test that has expired reagents?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah. I would contact the developer, and also contact the FDA. We do not recommend using expired reagents. You'd basically have to do a full QC test, as the manufacturer would, on a daily basis, to know if you can trust the results each day. It's just not worth it. It's just not practical. And the manufacturer isn't guaranteeing that those products will be functional and sensitive enough beyond the expiration date. So the FDA does not recommend that.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Pauline Gee

QA Block 5-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Do we need an Instruction for Use (IFU) document for LDT EUA authorization?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: For high-complexity CLIA-certified labs submitting an LDT EUA, laboratory procedures are typically provided instead of an IFU.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Do we need an Instruction for Use (IFU) document for LDT EUA authorization?
VERBATIM ANSWER: For LDTs, which are tests that are designed, developed, and used within a single high-complexity CLIA-certified lab, typically the laboratory developer provides their laboratory procedures to accompany the EUA request in lieu of an IFU, or the instructions for use, that we would typically see with a commercial distributed test kit.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Joseph Tartal (FDA)
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: LDT EUA authorization, IFU requirements, CLIA-certified labs
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 5-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Do we need an EUA summary document for LDT EUA authorization?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: LDTs generally provide laboratory procedures instead of an IFU for EUA requests. FDA will post an EUA summary after authorization, including test performance details.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Do we need an EUA summary document for LDT EUA authorization?
VERBATIM ANSWER: And then regarding documentation, for LDTs, which are tests that are designed, developed, and used within a single high-complexity CLIA-certified lab, typically the laboratory developer provides their laboratory procedures to accompany the EUA request in lieu of an IFU, or the instructions for use, that we would typically see with a commercial distributed test kit. Upon authorization, FDA would then post an EUA summary, including information about the tests performance. And this labeling approach may also be used for certain tests developed by laboratories that are distributed and performed in multiple laboratories.

TOPICS: minor modifications, EUA submissions, FDA guidance
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 10-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is it a requirement for high-complexity CLIA labs to validate any modifications made to an EUA test before use?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: High-complexity CLIA labs must validate any modifications made to an EUA test and confirm equivalent performance. These modifications do not require FDA notification or a new EUA if they follow guidance, and the test remains limited to use within the modifying lab.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is it a requirement for high-complexity CLIA labs to validate any modifications made to an EUA test before use?
VERBATIM ANSWER: If you take a look at the guidance, it does spell out that there are differences between the policies for commercial manufacturers modifying their test, and a high-complexity CLIA-certified lab modifying an authorized molecular diagnostic. If the lab is modifying the test, and it meets the description in the guidance, so it's not changing the indications for use or the analyte-specific reagents, we would not expect a notification to FDA or a new EUA from the lab, as long as the lab has validated the modification, and confirmed that the performance of the modified test is equivalent to the performance of the authorized test, and the use of that modified test is limited to the high-complexity CLIA lab in which the modification was made. We would also expect that lab to provide transparency about the fact that it is not an authorized test at that point, and that it has not been reviewed by FDA.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: EUA test modifications, CLIA lab requirements, FDA guidance
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 16-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are labs allowed to use expired reagents if the performance criteria according to the EUA is still met?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA does not recommend using expired reagents, as they are not guaranteed to remain functional or sensitive beyond their expiration date. Labs should contact the developer and FDA, but relying on expired materials requires extensive daily QC testing and is not deemed practical.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are labs allowed to use expired reagents if the performance criteria according to the EUA is still met?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah. I would contact the developer, and also contact the FDA. We do not recommend using expired reagents. You'd basically have to do a full QC test, as the manufacturer would, on a daily basis, to know if you can trust the results each day. It's just not worth it. It's just not practical.
