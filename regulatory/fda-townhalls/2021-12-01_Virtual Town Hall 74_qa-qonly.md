TOPICS: November 17th town hall recording, Availability timeline
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the implications for diagnostic test developers if their test is not specifically contacted for omicron performance evaluation?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Test developers should still evaluate their test for variant performance issues, even if they are not specifically contacted. If they haven't been contacted, it likely indicates a low risk for their test, but they should inform FDA if issues are discovered.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the implications for diagnostic test developers if their test is not specifically contacted for omicron performance evaluation?
VERBATIM ANSWER: And we also note that all test developers are expected to do to their own evaluation for variant performance issues. Because there is so much concern about omicron, we certainly want you to go ahead and do your assessment. And if you haven't been contacted by an email, it means that we think that the risk is relatively low. However, if for your particular test, however, if you do discover something, please let us know as soon as possible, and we'll work with you on that.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: omicron test evaluation, test developer responsibilities, FDA guidance
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How should COVID-19 test developers notify the FDA if they identify performance issues with their test related to omicron?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Test developers should notify the FDA as soon as possible if they discover performance issues related to their test and omicron.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How should COVID-19 test developers notify the FDA if they identify performance issues with their test related to omicron?
VERBATIM ANSWER: If for your particular test, however, if you do discover something, please let us know as soon as possible, and we'll work with you on that.

REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Which tests currently allow for S-gene dropout detection, and are there plans to validate additional tests for this purpose?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The Thermo Fisher TaqPath combo assay and at least 20 other tests with similar S-gene designs can detect S-gene dropout. The FDA is updating its website with additional information on these tests.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Which tests currently allow for S-gene dropout detection, and are there plans to validate additional tests for this purpose?
VERBATIM ANSWER: One of the easiest methods to screen for omicron is through the so-called S-gene dropout. The best known widest utilized assay out there is probably the Thermo Fisher TaqPath combo assay. As we saw with alpha and have posted on our website already, that assay is able to detect the deletion 69 70 through the dropout of S, but the other signals are positive. So these are the best samples to send for sequencing to determine whether or not that sample is coming from a patient infected with the omicron variant. At least there are over 20 tests that are able to detect the S-gene dropout. All of them have the S-gene design that Thermo Fisher has. We are working on updating our FDA website with this information.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: S-gene dropout detection, Tests for omicron variant, FDA updates
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-5
CLARIFIED QUESTION: When will the FDA update its website with details about omicron's impact on test sensitivity?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is in the process of updating its website with information on omicron's impact on test sensitivity. Updates will be made on an ongoing basis, and there will likely be a communication when the page is initially updated.
VERBATIM QUESTION: When will the FDA update its website with details about omicron's impact on test sensitivity?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We are working on updating our FDA website with this information. Also look to the website for any updates on any tests that may see a decrease in sensitivity for omicron. And we will update that web page on an ongoing basis. So check back when you can. In all likelihood, we will do some sort of communication on that web page when it's first updated with omicron.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Omicron impact on test sensitivity, FDA website updates
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-6
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What specific steps should diagnostic labs take to incorporate the S-gene dropout method for screening omicron?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Diagnostic labs should use tests with the S-gene dropout signal, such as the Thermo Fisher TaqPath combo assay, for omicron screening. Such tests detect the deletion 69-70 and other positive signals. Labs should send these samples for sequencing to confirm omicron and monitor public health.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What specific steps should diagnostic labs take to incorporate the S-gene dropout method for screening omicron?
VERBATIM ANSWER: One of the easiest methods to screen for omicron is through the so-called S-gene dropout. The best known widest utilized assay out there is probably the Thermo Fisher TaqPath combo assay. As we saw with alpha and have posted on our website already, that assay is able to detect the deletion 69 70 through the dropout of S, but the other signals are positive. So these are the best samples to send for sequencing to determine whether or not that sample is coming from a patient infected with the omicron variant. And at this moment it's public health monitoring only. We know of no definitive decrease in vaccine or therapeutic efficacy. Obviously, separate efforts are going on for that. So we are encouraging all labs that can use a test that has the S-gene dropout signal when they can to test with that now until we get a good handle on omicron. At least there are over 20 tests that are able to detect the S-gene dropout. All of them have the S-gene design that Thermo Fisher has. We are working on updating our FDA website with this information.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA advises developers to evaluate their tests for omicron-related sensitivity issues and notify FDA if any issues are discovered. They will work with developers on identified concerns.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If omicron-related sensitivity issues are identified for a test, how should a developer proceed to address these?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We have already sent notifications out to key developers where we would specifically like them to assess performance for omicron. And we also note that all test developers are expected to do to their own evaluation for variant performance issues. Because there is so much concern about omicron, we certainly want you to go ahead and do your assessment. And if you haven't been contacted by an email, it means that we think that the risk is relatively low. However, if for your particular test, however, if you do discover something, please let us know as soon as possible, and we'll work with you on that.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE

#### 2. FDA Guidance on External and Internal Controls

QA Block 2-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the recommendations for external controls?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends external positive controls for point of care and CLIA labs to be about five times the LOD of the test for verification. Controls must be validated in analytical and clinical studies. At-home molecular tests generally require internal controls but not external ones. Third-party external controls labeled for IVD use do not need to adhere to the EUA holder quality system.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the recommendations for external controls?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So generally, FDA recommends that external positive controls for point of care and CLIA high complexity and moderate complexity labs be approximately five times the LOD of your test in order to verify that the test is performing as intended. And any control that's used with your device that you recommend using with your device or include in your labeling for use with your device whether or not that's provided with your test kit should be validated in the context of your analytical and clinical studies. For molecular tests that are intended for at home testing, an external control is generally not expected but an internal control is expected. And for a third party external controls that are labeled for IVD use and recommended for use with your test but are not included with your test kits, we do not expect those to be brought under the EUA holder quality system.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Joseph Tartal (FDA)

CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA updates EUA templates based on evolving factors. These updates do not affect prior authorizations unless revised or revoked. FDA continues to monitor test performance and contacts EUA holders directly if further evaluation is needed.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are early emergency use authorization manufacturers required to perform additional validation based on updated templates such as the recommendation in the October 6, 2021, molecular emergency use authorization template to evaluate each upper respiratory sample type?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So the recommendations that are provided in the EUA templates are updated based on a variety of factors throughout the pandemic and as things progress. Issuance of these updated recommendations in the EUA templates does not impact any previous authorizations. Unless they are revised or revoked, the previous EUAs are still valid as previously issued. We do continue to monitor tests and test performance post authorization, and we do reach out to an EUA holder directly if we determine that there's a need for further evaluation.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Joseph Tartal (FDA)
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: EUA template updates, Validation requirements, Test monitoring
REVIEW FLAG: False

#### 6. Evaluating Swab Equivalency for OTC Antigen Test Approval

QA Block 6-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How should we design studies if we are using two different swab manufacturers, one as an alternate and one as the main swab, for an over-the-counter COVID-19 antigen test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: If the primary and alternate swabs are made from the same material, include this in your submission and test the alternate swab to ensure compatibility. Typically, a bench experiment should suffice without requiring a full clinical study. For significant differences in swab material, an LOD or similar study may be needed. Contact the FDA inbox with specific details about the swabs for further guidance.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How should we design studies if we are using two different swab manufacturers, one as an alternate and one as the main swab, for an over-the-counter COVID-19 antigen test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, that would be important. And if they are the same material, I would provide that in the submission. And you probably want to do just a quick check to make sure that the swab that you don't do your clinical studies with and your analytical studies with us still performs well in the test. Kris, do you have anything more specific about that? I don't believe a full clinical study is needed with those and bench experiment probably is fine. Yes, I mean, it's always safest to reach out to the inbox with these specific questions, and certainly if you're talking about a swab that has the same material, the same dimensions, typically that's kind of interchangeable from our standpoint with that kind of data. If there are changes you know, a spun polyester to a phone swab for instance, that's when we start talking about OK, well maybe even LOD study or some kind of other bench study to establish similar performance that's needed. So I think really getting the details of those two different swabs would be your first step and then just letting us know that question from the inbox would be helpful.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What kind of study, such as an LOD study, would be sufficient to show equivalency between the main and alternate swabs?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA advises contacting them with specifics, but typically, swabs with identical materials and dimensions are considered interchangeable. If materials differ, like spun polyester versus foam, an LOD or bench study may be required to confirm performance.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What kind of study, such as an LOD study, would be sufficient to show equivalency between the main and alternate swabs?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, I mean, it's always safest to reach out to the inbox with these specific questions, and certainly if you're talking about a swab that has the same material, the same dimensions, typically that's kind of interchangeable from our standpoint with that kind of data. If there are changes you know, a spun polyester to a phone swab for instance, that's when we start talking about OK, well maybe even LOD study or some kind of other bench study to establish similar performance that's needed.

#### 7. Submitting Separate EUAs for Distinct Serology Assays

QA Block 7-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Should we submit a separate EUA for the nucleocapsid and RBD serology assays?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: If the nucleocapsid and RBD serology assays are different tests and both will be offered, separate EUA requests are required. If only the nucleocapsid assay will be offered, notify FDA to remove the RBD assay from the notification list and submit an EUA for the nucleocapsid assay.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Should we submit a separate EUA for the nucleocapsid and RBD serology assays?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So if those are two different assays and you are intending to offer both of them, then yes, we would expect to see two EUA requests, one for each test. If you have switched so that you are no longer planning to offer the RBD assay, and you're only planning to offer the nucleocapsid assay, then you could just let us know that you want to be removed from the notification list without submitting an EUA request for the first one and then just submit your EUA request for the second one.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Is there a contact available for companies to discuss specifics about converting an LDT to an EUA for an assay already on the market?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah, so you can use the template if you want. But if it's easier just to scan the documents that you use to record your validation, and you can send an email to the template's email address, Toby? You can respond to that later. Let us know that you do have an LDT, and you will be submitting and you certainly can ask any questions of the template email at the template email address that you have. But you can look at the templates on the FDA website and see what kind of things we're looking, so be sure and if you have them for sure and scan them and send them to us. There may be elements you know that you have in your particular CLIA file that we're not going to be looking for. So and then if there's something that isn't there, we will follow up or someone will follow up and say, hey, do you have this, which you may have left off. So our focus here and because we're allowing this non-standard format, which makes it a little bit harder on our reviewers because everyone's going to be a little bit different. We want to make it this very easy for LDT labs who have not previously submitted their application to the FDA to go ahead and just provide what they've already had in the format they have it for CLIA. And we'll review that. If there are questions, or if there are potential concerns about an application, our focus is going to be working with that those individual labs, try to address those questions and work with the labs.

But if it's easier just to scan the documents that you use to record your validation, and you can send an email to the template's email address, Toby? You can respond to that later. Let us know that you do have an LDT, and you will be submitting and you certainly can ask any questions of the template email at the template email address that you have. But you can look at the templates on the FDA website and see what kind of things we're looking, so be sure and if you have them for sure and scan them and send them to us. There may be elements you know that you have in your particular CLIA file that we're not going to be looking for. So and then if there's something that isn't there, we will follow up or someone will follow up and say, hey, do you have this, which you may have left off.

Validation data is important, and the FDA recommends referring to the provided template for guidance. Starting with individual sample validations is often the fastest path before considering pooling.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Do you require just a brief description of a pooling strategy, or is clinical data necessary?
VERBATIM ANSWER: OK so absolutely, there are situations where we want to see data. I think Kris was probably most up to date on this. What we've seen is is properly developed and validated pooling strategies that don't pool too many samples for the given technology, especially for molecular tests has proven to be quite sensitive. And so in order to get greater testing capacity and throughput, those kit developers and those labs that want to utilize pooling, it certainly isn't required to pool, but if you want to and you can and it expands testing opportunities, We're all for that, and we'll work with you.

#### 13. Validating External Controls for Point-of-Care Home Tests

QA Block 13-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How should a CLIA waived point-of-care lab validate an external control to use with home tests that don't have validated external controls with their authorization?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends that developers submit a request during authorization to include labeling for point-of-care use. Alternatively, they can follow up with the previous reviewer or the template's email box to address external controls validation. Sites must also adhere to the manufacturer's instructions for use as per CLIA requirements.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How should a CLIA waived point-of-care lab validate an external control to use with home tests that don't have validated external controls with their authorization?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So we typically if that request comes in from a developer at the time of authorization, we would include labeling for point-of- care. And I think there may be at least a post-market commitment to provide external controls for point- of-care sites. I do think you should send this question to your previous reviewer for the authorization and/or the template's email box so we can get back to you specifically. Yeah, I think that probably the simplest thing would be for the developer to get this added to the authorization if the external control is being validated for point-of-care use. I think that there is-- we don't like to speak for our CMS colleagues on this call, but our understanding is that certificate of waiver sites under CLIA are required to perform a test according to the manufacturer's instructions for use.

#### 15. Validation of Tests Against Updated EUA Templates

QA Block 15-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Could you explain the second emailed question about validating previously authorized tests to the new templates?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA clarified that updated recommendations in the EUA templates do not affect previously issued EUAs unless they are revised or revoked. Previously issued EUAs remain valid, and the FDA monitors test performance and contacts EUA holders if further evaluation is needed.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Could you explain the second emailed question about validating previously authorized tests to the new templates?
VERBATIM ANSWER: OK, so what we indicated for that question is that the recommendations provided in the EUA templates are updated throughout the pandemic and based on a variety of factors. So issuance of updated recommendations in the EUA templates does not impact any previously issued EUAs. So unless an EUA is revised or revoked, the previous EUAs days are still valid as previously issued. We continue to monitor tests and test performance on an ongoing basis after authorization. And we reach out to an EUA holder directly if we determine that there's a need for any further evaluation.

QA Block 15-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does issuance of updated recommendations in the EUA templates impact previously issued EUAs?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA stated that updated recommendations in EUA templates do not affect previously issued EUAs, which remain valid unless specifically revised or revoked. The FDA monitors test performance after authorization and contacts EUA holders directly if further action is needed.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does issuance of updated recommendations in the EUA templates impact previously issued EUAs?
VERBATIM ANSWER: OK, so what we indicated for that question is that the recommendations provided in the EUA templates are updated throughout the pandemic and based on a variety of factors. So issuance of updated recommendations in the EUA templates does not impact any previously issued EUAs. So unless an EUA is revised or revoked, the previous EUAs days are still valid as previously issued. We continue to monitor tests and test performance on an ongoing basis after authorization. And we reach out to an EUA holder directly if we determine that there's a need for any further evaluation.

QA Block 15-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Will all previously authorized tests require revalidation based on template updates?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA does not require revalidation of previously authorized tests solely based on template updates unless there is a specific issue with a test. Updated recommendations in the EUA templates do not affect prior EUAs unless revised or revoked.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Will all previously authorized tests require revalidation based on template updates?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The recommendations provided in the EUA templates are updated throughout the pandemic and based on a variety of factors.

So unless an EUA is revised or revoked, the previous EUAs days are still valid as previously issued. We continue to monitor tests and test performance on an ongoing basis after authorization. And we reach out to an EUA holder directly if we determine that there's a need for any further evaluation. Our thinking has evolved as the science has evolved, and unless we see something with a particular test that was authorized before or there's a particular issue that we feel needs to be addressed, we're not going to require all 400 plus test developers to revalidate their test. But as we go forward, since there are so many tests already authorized and their thinking has evolved, that new submissions or submissions under review, this will be discussed during the interactive process.

#### 16. Enrichment Strategies for OTC Antigen Test Clinical Studies

QA Block 16-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is the enrichment strategy still an option for clinical study designs for OTC antigen tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is open to enrichment strategies for OTC antigen tests as long as they do not introduce bias favoring the candidate test, and the collected data accurately reflects the test's performance. Sponsors should provide study design and justification to the review team or through a pre-EUA process.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is the enrichment strategy still an option for clinical study designs for OTC antigen tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: OK so we're open to enrichment schemes. You know unfortunately the testing positivity rate out there now is pretty high in the 5% to 10% range, so it's a little bit easier. But we are open to enrichment schemes. We just want to make sure that doesn't introduce bias towards the candidate test making it look better than it really is. So that's best handled with the review team through the template's email box or through a submission of a pre-EUA with a specific question on enrichment for an OTC test. And I would provide your study design for that enrichment and your justification for why it is not going to bias in favor of the candidate test. And we're open to those questions but want to assure that the data that's collected in such studies accurately reflects the true performance of the test.

QA Block 8-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the FDA's definition of 'other epidemiological reasons to suspect COVID-19'?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA defines 'other epidemiological reasons to suspect COVID-19' as excluding individuals who are close contacts or exhibit known risk factors. It refers to a general screening population without efforts to differentiate specific risk factors.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the FDA's definition of 'other epidemiological reasons to suspect COVID-19'?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So in the template, it does say 10 positive individuals without symptoms or other epidemiological reasons to suspect. So that's really the screening population, right, so it's not folks that are close contacts. It's not folks that are basically close contacts is kind of a differentiator there. So if it is kind of that screening population where you're taking all comers and there's really no kind of efforts to differentiate risk factors, then that really is kind of the screening population and what we'd be looking for in that in that study.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can a developer add external control validation for point-of-care use to the authorization?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA suggests that developers can add external control validation for point-of-care use to their authorization, as certificate of waiver sites under CLIA must follow the manufacturer's instructions. External controls not part of these instructions may cause issues.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can a developer add external control validation for point-of-care use to the authorization?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah, I think that probably the simplest thing would be for the developer to get this added to the authorization if the external control is being validated for point-of-care use. I think that there is-- we don't like to speak for our CMS colleagues on this call, but our understanding is that certificate of waiver sites under CLIA are required to perform a test according to the manufacturer's instructions for use. So I think that would cause some issues if they wanted to use a control that is not in the instructions for use.
