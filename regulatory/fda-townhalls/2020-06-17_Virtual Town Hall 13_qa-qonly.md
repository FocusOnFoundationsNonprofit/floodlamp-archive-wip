#### 1. FDA Updates on SARS-CoV-2 Testing and EUA Processes

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the specific validation requirements for asymptomatic testing claims?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA has updated the molecular EUA template with validation recommendations for asymptomatic testing claims. EUAs are required to make asymptomatic detection claims, primarily for molecular tests but also applicable to direct antigen tests.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the specific validation requirements for asymptomatic testing claims?
VERBATIM ANSWER: You're probably aware that we made updates to the molecular EUA template, to include information about recommendations for validation of asymptomatic testing. If that is a claim that you want to make about your tests or assay. As well as for pooling. And that's pooling samples so that you might test more samples with given reagents. So obviously we're interested that accurate testing still occurs in those situations. And we do want to make it clear that EUAs are required for pooling and authorizations. And they are also required if you want to make a claim about the ability of your test or assay to detect asymptomatic viral positive patients. And obviously this applies mainly to molecular tests. But it could apply to direct antigen tests as well.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: asymptomatic testing, validation requirements, EUA template updates
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is an EUA required for pooling samples in molecular or antigen tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA confirms that EUAs are required for pooling samples in molecular or antigen tests, as well as for claiming the detection of asymptomatic viral positive patients.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is an EUA required for pooling samples in molecular or antigen tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: And we do want to make it clear that EUAs are required for pooling and authorizations. And they are also required if you want to make a claim about the ability of your test or assay to detect asymptomatic viral positive patients. And obviously this applies mainly to molecular tests. But it could apply to direct antigen tests as well.

REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How can a lab running an authorized commercial test incorporate asymptomatic testing or pooling into their process?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Labs running authorized commercial tests can incorporate asymptomatic testing or pooling by coordinating with the test manufacturer. Manufacturers are encouraged to submit an EUA Amendment, and labs may submit their own EUA if granted a Right of Reference by the manufacturer.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How can a lab running an authorized commercial test incorporate asymptomatic testing or pooling into their process?
VERBATIM ANSWER: If you are in a lab that's running a commercial test that's been authorized, and want to add either asymptomatic or pooling, you can work with the commercial test manufacturer. We are encouraging, obviously, those kit manufacturers to submit a EUA Amendment for these. If we can facilitate you working with the commercial manufacturer to add these additional NWX-FDA OC claims, we will do our part to do that. You can submit your own EUA if the manufacturer gives you Right of Reference to do so. It's just a simple, brief memo that says the agency can refer to data the manufacturer has filed when they review your validation data for pooling or asymptomatic. It has been our experience that most, if not all, manufacturers are very open to doing this for their customers. But we can't make that 100% assuring.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: asymptomatic testing, pooling process, EUA Amendment

QA Block 1-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What steps should a kit manufacturer take to submit an EUA amendment for new claims?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Kit manufacturers should submit an EUA amendment for claims such as pooling or asymptomatic testing. If supported by the commercial manufacturer, a simple memo granting 'Right of Reference' to FDA for existing data can be provided. Most manufacturers are generally cooperative in providing this access.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What steps should a kit manufacturer take to submit an EUA amendment for new claims?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We are encouraging, obviously, those kit manufacturers to submit a EUA Amendment for these.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Where can developers find clinical specimens or validation material for testing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: If you're a developer and you're having trouble getting clinical specimens to do your validation work, I'd like to refer you to our FAQ page where there's information about validation material. More and more vendors are able to provide validation material for you. You can also look at our list of EUA authorized LDTs, and consider reaching out to any of those labs to see if they are able to provide any remnants of leftover specimens for your validation work. In this pandemic and emergency I've seen, you know, lots of folks pool resources. Get together and help one another. And that's - and we're so appreciative of that. And of course, any sort of IRB requirements should be followed and adhered to in that situation.

QA Block 1-10
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What improvements have been made to ensure timely contact assignment for EUA submissions?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: To ensure timely contact assignment for EUA submissions, the FDA has directed that all submissions with complete data be assigned a contact within two weeks of receipt. If this does not occur, applicants are encouraged to email the FDA to escalate the issue.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What improvements have been made to ensure timely contact assignment for EUA submissions?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Finally, for my talking points, before I turn it over to Toby, and before we open it up for questions, we have seen unprecedented volumes of submissions. Our Expert Team is working very hard, long days. We want all -- and this is at my direction within the office -- we want EUA submissions. This doesn't apply to pre-EUAs necessarily. But to EUA submissions where the application is complete, all data is there, and it's ready for us to review it. I want a directive that all EUA submissions should be assigned a contact within our office within two weeks of receipt. Now I've heard some, at least one-offs, where this hasn't happened. And we're going to correct that. And as part of that correction, if you're in that situation I'd like you to reach out through our EUA Template email address, to me, Timothy Stenzel. Just ask to have that email directed to me. And I will be ensuring personally, that you get assigned a contact within our office, that you can ask about status and get updates on a regular basis. So again, I'm going to step up and do that, to make sure that all are going assignments within two weeks. For those that received that, and send an NWX-FDA OC email, I'll be working to get those caught up as soon as possible. And I will work on that, as fast and as soon as possible.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)

QA Block 1-12
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How has the EUA page restructuring changed access to specific COVID-19 diagnostic test information?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The EUA page restructuring separates device EUAs into individual pages by device type, including IVDs, and organizes tests into distinct tables (e.g., molecular, antigen, serology). This aims to improve accessibility and organization.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How has the EUA page restructuring changed access to specific COVID-19 diagnostic test information?
VERBATIM ANSWER: As many of you may have noticed, our EUA page has been restructured. While this may be a little bit shocking at first, we hope that the restructuring will ultimately make it easier to find what you're looking for. Previously on the Device EUA page, all device EUAs were on the same Web page which may have made it difficult to find what you were looking for. And specifically to find the IVD section. And all of the tests were grouped together in a single table. So this restructuring has created a standalone COVID-19 EUA Medical Device page with separate pages for each device type. So IVD EUAs now have their own page. If you had bookmarked the direct link to the IVD section of the EUA page previously, that should redirect you to the new IVD page. (Post meeting clarification - the old link to the IVD section does not redirect to the new page. The link to the new COVID-19 IVD EUA page is www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-emergency-use-authorizations-medical-devices/vitro-diagnostics-euas). And then on the IVD page, now the EUAs are broken out into separate tables so that it will be easier to distinguish between authorizations for molecular tests, antigen tests, serology, and so on. So we hope that this will make things more streamlined and easier to find what you're looking for.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What should users do if they encounter errors or issues on the newly restructured EUA webpage?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Users encountering errors or issues on the restructured EUA webpage should contact FDA directly or use the EUA mailbox to report problems, which will be addressed promptly.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What should users do if they encounter errors or issues on the newly restructured EUA webpage?
VERBATIM ANSWER: If you have trouble with the page or if you notice anything that looks not correct, please reach out - you can reach out to me NWX-FDA OC directly, or you can reach out through the EUA mailbox. And they'll get that over to me. And we absolutely want to correct anything that we may not have gotten quite right with this restructuring.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA still require making sure that home-use serological test kit results get reported?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, that is the ask in this emergency is that positive results and unintelligible negative results get reported. So we are open to how that can be accomplished. And we realize that in the home, in a non-healthcare or other non-healthcare facility situation where there is not a direct role of a clinician for a healthcare worked in seeing the test results and interpreting them. That there is going to be a challenge in meeting that important element. But we are open to various ways of doing that. And willing to work with developers on how that gets accomplished.

#### 4. Prioritization of COVID-19 Testing Approval Processes

QA Block 4-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is the approval process for COVID-19 diagnostics first-come, first-serve?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA aims to follow a first-come, first-serve approach for COVID-19 diagnostics approvals. However, this might not apply during the pandemic, as complete applications ready for authorization may be prioritized over incomplete ones.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is the approval process for COVID-19 diagnostics first-come, first-serve?
VERBATIM ANSWER: I would say that all things being equal, which they aren't usually. Unintelligible is not usually in this pandemic. We could -- and I've directed the office -- if all things being equal, that first come first served is what I want for the office to do. And however, it may be that an application needs some work before it can be finally reviewed. And as we're waiting for additional comments, someone that might have come in later, if it's a complete package, one that we can make a decision on, that may be prioritized over the other. Because if it's ready to be authorized, we don't want to delay on that.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Sean McHugh
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: COVID-19 diagnostics approval, first-come first-serve process, application prioritization

VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the best practices for rolling out wide-scale COVID-19 testing, such as in dental offices or at-home testing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So we were very interested in authorizing a point of care test and a home-use test. The home-use test, the other settings other than healthcare that situations would also apply. So it could be schools, it could be, you know, places of employment, shopping centers, whatever. They all fit within what we call the home bucket, because a healthcare worker, potentially based on the authorization, may not be directly involved. And then, yes again, point of care.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Sean McHugh
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: wide-scale testing, point-of-care testing, home-use testing
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 4-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the criteria for a diagnostic test to be considered high priority, such as point-of-care or automated high-throughput platforms?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA prioritizes applications for point-of-care tests and automated high-throughput platforms when they have complete or rolling data submissions directly linked to these usages, as they significantly impact public health.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the criteria for a diagnostic test to be considered high priority, such as point-of-care or automated high-throughput platforms?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We have a priority now because we have so many applications. And also because we have the notification pathways. So users can - or developers can notify us of viral detections and serology tests. Can notify us that they've NWX-FDA OC finished their validation. And can then go ahead and distribute or offer the test. And they have a time limit to get the EUA application into us. And unless we say stop, during that EUA review process, they can continue to market and perform testing. As long as all the other guidance is followed. So because of that, it allows us to focus on those applications that are deemed to be of the greatest public health importance. Currently, those are point-of- care tests. And I would say it's challenging for us. There are so many people interested in - developers interested in having a point-of-care claim. What I've directed the office to do is, if there is data to review for a point-of- care, whether it's complete or it's on a rolling basis where we're seeing data. That we make data review of point-of-care tests, the priority. If someone - now with the home collection and other areas, we have given some guidance on point-of-care testing studies. So that information should be out there and developers should know what to do. So what we're really triaging here is that when we have data to review pertaining to a high priority such as point-of-care, that we receive that. However, if there is no directly linked point-of-care data like if it's a serology and it's going to be a finger stick, we don't have finger stick, and we don't flex studies. If we don't have the user studies. If we don't have any of that sort of point-of-care related data, that application, unfortunately, cannot be triaged to the high priority bucket right now.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: high priority diagnostic tests, criteria for prioritization, FDA review process
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 4-5
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What data is required for an application to be triaged as high priority for EUA review?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Applications must include data related to high-priority testing, such as point-of-care specific data, to be triaged as high priority. Missing data like user studies or point-of-care-specific validation results prevents prioritization.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What data is required for an application to be triaged as high priority for EUA review?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So what we're really triaging here is that when we have data to review pertaining to a high priority such as point-of-care, that we receive that. However, if there is no directly linked point-of-care data like if it's a serology and it's going to be a finger stick, we don't have finger stick, and we don't flex studies.

QA Block 4-8
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the FDA's requirements for home-use and home collection test authorizations?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA prioritizes applications for home-use and point-of-care tests based on public health importance. Home-use tests can be used in settings like schools or workplaces without direct involvement of healthcare workers. Developers must notify FDA after finishing validation, submit an EUA application within a time limit, and comply with guidance.
VERBATIM QUESTION: IMPLICIT
VERBATIM ANSWER: So we were very interested in authorizing a point of care test and a home-use test. The home-use test, the other settings other than healthcare that situations would also apply. So it could be schools, it could be, you know, places of employment, shopping centers, whatever. They all fit within what we call the home bucket, because a healthcare worker, potentially based on the authorization, may not be directly involved. And then, yes again, point of care. So - and it bears upon your first question. So we have a priority now because we have so many applications. And also because we have the notification pathways.

That contact will have access to the priority list. The challenge is - and I should be able to give you some feedback and especially based on the priority. If you are a priority candidate, you're already going to have a reviewer and if your assay is at NCI and you and I as part of the candidate, then NCI will really unintelligible any reason to remove that. So the NCI has the rank order of based on unintelligible and put some preserve in that high priority list that they will get to and it's just a matter of where you are in the high priority list. The high priority list is longer than NCI's unintelligible performing testing, you know? The perform testing on multiple devices each day that they test and - but there's a limit on how many different devices of the test on a given day.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA is increasing NCI testing capacity by adding staff and prioritizing applications based on triage. They are also streamlining approvals for point-of-care, home tests, and high-throughput applications.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What steps are being taken to increase testing capacity at the NCI?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. So we have a triage procedure for - at NCI. We have more tests than unintelligible can be performed in one week at NCI or so. They're working very hard. They're looking at adding staff. We're looking ahead to accumulating ahead of time of the testing capacity at NCI, that we only have samples to test with the test. The NCI looks to the agency, the FDA, to triage. So what we're doing is we're reviewing applications and making assessments and the same sort of priorities that I mentioned before do affect the NCI testing. So point of care is a priority. So if all of point of care studies have been submitted and they look good, we would move that out unintelligible ahead in the NCI unintelligible and likewise should there be any sort of high throughput that would also be - I can't think - and then a home test would also be a home collection or a home test would also be on the high priority list. So otherwise, I directed that - the NCI list to be on a first-come, first-serve basis.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can developers expect feedback on their NCI test priority status within two weeks after submission?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Developers can expect contact within two weeks of submission for information about NCI priority status. Priority is determined by factors such as test type and testing capacity, though delays may occur due to the length of the high-priority list and current test processing capacity.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can developers expect feedback on their NCI test priority status within two weeks after submission?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So as I said, every developer within two weeks of submission going forward - and I hope that most of them is backwards for some period of time - have a contact. That contact will have access to the priority list. The challenge is - and I should be able to give you some feedback and especially based on the priority. If you are a priority candidate, you're already going to have a reviewer and if your assay is at NCI and you and I as part of the candidate, then NCI will really unintelligible any reason to remove that. So the NCI has the rank order of based on unintelligible and put some preserve in that high priority list that they will get to and it's just a matter of where you are in the high priority list. The high priority list is longer than NCI's unintelligible performing testing, you know?

And they have a time limit to get the EUA application into us. And unless we say stop, during that EUA review process, they can continue to market and perform testing. As long as all the other guidance is followed. So because of that, it allows us to focus on those applications that are deemed to be of the greatest public health importance. Currently, those are point-of-care tests.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What happens to applications that are incomplete or need additional data during the EUA review process?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Applications needing additional work may be delayed until further data is provided. If a complete package is submitted later and ready for decision, it may take precedence to avoid unnecessary delays.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What happens to applications that are incomplete or need additional data during the EUA review process?
VERBATIM ANSWER: And however, it may be that an application needs some work before it can be finally reviewed. And as we're waiting for additional comments, someone that might have come in later, if it's a complete package, one that we can make a decision on, that may be prioritized over the other.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Can remnant specimens be used for antigen clinical validation?
VERBATIM ANSWER: ... four - yes, clinical validation section test and I'm going to pull that up now. So - and we will be open to use any remnant specimens, but it should be intact and not engineered and not contrived. For example, we authorized the unintelligible engine test using BTM and they, you know - so that was totally appropriate in that situation. It's good for our reviewers to - if you want to make sure that a particular type of remnant is feasible there could be limits on the authorization, you know, if there is anything unintelligible particular about, you know, if you selected those remnants in some way. We are looking for an unbiased selection of those remnants. So if you have a source of remnants, we would unintelligible based on a comparative molecular test identify those, but we would ask that you reduce the chance for bias through various mechanisms using unintelligible recommended and that you between unintelligible dates that you're selecting samples that consecutive positive and consecutive negative unintelligible collecting those would be used rather than non-random or some sort of biased approach for selecting those samples.

QA Block 11-8
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the implications for labs using RUO molecular tests that require notification, validation, and EUA submission?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: RUO molecular tests require validation, notification, and EUA submission if used for clinical purposes. FDA recommends that developers prepare, validate, and submit their kits.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the implications for labs using RUO molecular tests that require notification, validation, and EUA submission?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So that is possible. They cannot promote it for use in the pandemic in this emergency and that would be examined closely and appropriate action would be taken if that's the case, but there are some labs who will take an RUO test and validate it for their purposes. If it's a serology test and they validate it, it would require notification, but not an EUA submission. If it's a molecular test, a nucleic acid test, it would require validation and notification and an EUA submission. So it does put a burden on customers if they're going to use it for that. And so therefore, we recommend that all developers with COVID-19 prepare, validate and submit their kits.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends accessing the RUO labeling guidance for details on appropriate labeling, emphasizing it is intended for research-focused components and tests and not for clinical use.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How can developers access the FDA's guidance on RUO labeling?
VERBATIM ANSWER: I would also encourage you to take a look at the RUO guidance that we have, the labeling for RUO guidance because it's important to note that if you know that your test is being used in a research unintelligible if you're - if you know that it's being used in clinical and you're selling it purposely to a clinical lab for use on clinical testing and clinical - for clinical testing, that would not be labeled appropriately if you're labeling it as RUO. RUO labeling is really intended for components and tests that are intended to be used for research.
