QA Block 2-7
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are your recommendations for flu B validation given its low prevalence in the U.S.?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recognizes the low prevalence of flu B and recommends targeting at least 30 flu B-positive subjects in a prospective study for CLIA waiver or OTC IVD indications, reduced from previous targets of 120. Discussions on validation plans with FDA are encouraged as recommendations may evolve.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are your recommendations for flu B validation given its low prevalence in the U.S.?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We recognize the need for additional tests for influenza, particularly over-the-counter tests and point-of-care tests, including respiratory panels with COVID-19. We will continue to tailor our validation recommendations to best serve public health needs. We have provided recommendations in our EUA templates, pre-EUA, and Pre-Submission responses, and it is important to note that these are recommendations provided at a single point in time based on the available information at that time. They are not requirements, as Tim has mentioned, and we are open to alternate approaches to demonstrate performance of your test. We encourage discussion of flu test validation as part of a Pre-Submission and with your lead reviewer, since this is an evolving issue. The recently-issued EUA for the OTC Lucira COVID-19 and flu home test included data from 94 subjects determined positive for influenza A by the comparator method and 0 subjects positive for flu B from the prospectively collected clinical samples. Banked patient samples collected in transfer media were used to establish test performance with flu B due to the low prevalence in the clinical study population and across the US, as reported by CDC. As part of the conditions for authorization, the clinical performance of this test must be further evaluated in an FDA agreed-upon clinical study. The goal of such a study will be to establish performance for flu B in a clinical study with prospective samples. Due to the low levels of flu B in the past few seasons, we are adjusting our general recommendations for developers to target at least 30 influenza-B-positive subjects in a prospective clinical study to support CLIA waiver or over-the-counter IVD indications. This differs from feedback developers may have previously received, such as in Q-Submissions. These previous recommendations for testing included a target of 120 subjects positive by the comparator method for flu B to support CLIA waiver and OTC IVD indications. Again, we encourage developers to continue engaging with us on this topic.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Kris Roth (FDA)
TOPICS: flu B validation, low prevalence, FDA recommendations

VERBATIM QUESTION: What were the conditions for authorization for the Lucira COVID-19 and flu home test related to flu validation?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The recently-issued EUA for the OTC Lucira COVID-19 and flu home test included data from 94 subjects determined positive for influenza A by the comparator method and 0 subjects positive for flu B from the prospectively collected clinical samples. Banked patient samples collected in transfer media were used to establish test performance with flu B due to the low prevalence in the clinical study population and across the US, as reported by CDC.

QA Block 2-10
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the relationship between the expiry of the 319 public health emergency and the continuation of the 564 EUA declaration?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The expiration of the 319 public health emergency does not affect the continuation of the 564 EUA declaration, as they are independent. The 564 EUA remains in effect until terminated by the Secretary of HHS, and 180 days notice is anticipated before such termination.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the relationship between the expiry of the 319 public health emergency and the continuation of the 564 EUA declaration?
VERBATIM ANSWER: As we've discussed previously on the town halls and mentioned in the last town hall, the administration has announced that the public health emergency under 319 will expire on May 11 and will not be renewed. We've also discussed on previous town halls and in our FAQs on our website that the 319 and the 564 declarations are independent, and the 319 public health emergency expiration does not impact the 564 declaration, which is what gives us the authority to issue emergency use authorizations. The COVID-19 EUA declaration under Section 564 of the FD&C Act will continue until the Secretary of HHS terminates it. And as is discussed in the draft transition plan guidance, we do expect 180 days notice before that 564 EUA declaration is terminated.

FDA plans to allow continued distribution of these tests while manufacturers' traditional marketing submissions are under review, with full details to be outlined in forthcoming final guidance.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How will manufacturers of EUA-authorized COVID-19 tests transition to normal operations once the 564 declaration ends?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The COVID-19 EUA declaration under Section 564 of the FD&C Act will continue until the Secretary of HHS terminates it. And as is discussed in the draft transition plan guidance, we do expect 180 days notice before that 564 EUA declaration is terminated. We don't plan to take any action that would leave Americans without the tests that they need, and we recognize the need for manufacturers of tests that were issued EUAs to have an appropriate period of transition time to move to normal operations when the declaration under 564 is no longer in effect. The draft transition plan guidance discusses that FDA intends to implement policies for continued distribution of tests previously issued an EUA while the manufacturer's traditional marketing submission is under review. And the final details for that will be described in the final transition plan guidance when issued.

QA Block 3-7
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are there plans for the FDA to establish specific regulations and special controls for at-home over-the-counter COVID-19 antigen tests similar to those for point-of-care tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA has not yet authorized at-home over-the-counter COVID-19 antigen tests. Regulations for point-of-care tests differ, and the first at-home test would require authorization through the de novo pathway.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are there plans for the FDA to establish specific regulations and special controls for at-home over-the-counter COVID-19 antigen tests similar to those for point-of-care tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: No, the Quidel Sofia 2 test is cleared only for point-of-care use, not over-the- counter. And the regulation and special controls were drafted for point-of-care use. While we have not yet granted full marketing authorization for an at-home over-the-counter COVID-19 antigen test, we are interested in doing so, and the first such test would need to be granted through the de novo pathway.

#### 4. Safety Considerations for At-Home SARS-CoV-2 Test Development

QA Block 4-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is it acceptable to include guanidine hydrochloride in an at-home SARS-CoV-2 test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA advises against using guanidinium salts in at-home devices unless sufficient safety measures are implemented. Detailed design information and labeling should be submitted for FDA review to evaluate risks and mitigations.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is it acceptable to include guanidine hydrochloride in an at-home SARS-CoV-2 test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Hazardous or irritating materials, such as guanidinium salts, should not be used for at-home devices unless the device has specific safety features to mitigate the risk of patient exposure. That might be, for example, releasing the preservative only when the container's lid is closed. We recommend that you provide the FDA with detailed design information, including images and a list of all reagents and concentrations, for an assessment of the toxicology profile of the components of your assay. We also recommend that your proposed assay labeling inform users of the risks associated with the use of your device as well as any recommendations for personal protective equipment.

#### 6. FDA Guidance on Single-Target vs. Multi-Target COVID Tests

QA Block 6-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can the FDA comment on the current thinking regarding single-target COVID tests for emergency use authorization now that there is a large database of genomic information available for manufacturers to utilize in the design of IVD tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA has observed performance changes over time in EUA tests as new variants emerge, leading to a public health risk if mutations occur in test-targeted regions. Single-target tests face greater susceptibility to such impacts compared to multiple-target tests. Additional labeling mitigations addressing these risks would likely be required for single-target tests.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can the FDA comment on the current thinking regarding single-target COVID tests for emergency use authorization now that there is a large database of genomic information available for manufacturers to utilize in the design of IVD tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: As the COVID pandemic has progressed, we've observed changes in EUA test performance as new variants emerge. We have a good deal of information on our website about that. And there is a risk to public health if test performance changes as new variants harboring mutations in regions targeted by a molecular test emerge. In general, tests that detect multiple SARS-CoV-2 targets have a lower probability of being impacted by mutations when compared with tests capable of detecting only one target region. It's likely appropriate that users of single-target tests be made aware of this risk through additional mitigations. So we would likely require additional labeling mitigations, so information in the product labeling about the risk of impact by mutations. And multiple target tests likely would not need these additional labeling mitigations.

#### 7. Recommendations for Addressing Flu B Performance Validation Challenges

QA Block 7-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What recommendations do you have if a sponsor does not have retrospective samples to demonstrate flu B performance due to low prevalence?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA suggests collecting flu B samples from the Southern Hemisphere due to higher prevalence there or using alternate means for EUA validation. Sponsors may propose to disable the flu B signal for validation, either via antigen cover masking or molecular test electronic modifications.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What recommendations do you have if a sponsor does not have retrospective samples to demonstrate flu B performance due to low prevalence?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So first of all, the flu season is picking up in the Southern hemisphere. And very frequently, flu B is more prevalent in the Southern hemisphere. So that is one pathway to collect flu B samples. If we're talking about an EUA-- so that would be an EUA that's combined with COVID-- we will be relatively flexible about how we do this by alternate means. But we do need to understand flu performance in some way. An alternate approach is to potentially turn off the flu B signal in some way. If it's an antigen test, it can be masked with a change to the cover. Or if it's a molecular test, sometimes that can be done by electronic means, if it's an electronic readout. So come in with a proposal about how we can-- how you can validate this for discussion.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: Yes, the proposed collection order is acceptable as long as standard of care procedures are followed per IRB recommendations, including any required washout periods between collections. This can be further clarified via the pre-EUA or Q-Sub processes.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If the standard of care at a clinical site is to first test with an FDA EUA at-home antigen test, then collect a comparator method test swab, and then collect the candidate test's sample, is this order of collection acceptable?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. You do need to follow standard of care procedures per IRB recommendations, when appropriate. That can be a molecular rather than, necessarily, an antigen test. But obviously, it takes longer to get that molecular result back than an on-site antigen test. You can pause between collections, particularly between the molecular comparator collection and the candidate test collection, to allow what we call a washout period. Or we've seen in developers, sponsors of studies wait 15 minutes in between collections, and to date I'm not aware of any challenges that put any of the comparisons at a disadvantage.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: How have concerns about training users to self-collect nasal swab samples evolved since the beginning of the pandemic?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Earlier in the pandemic, the FDA was concerned about users needing healthcare providers to train them on nasal swab collection. However, with widespread usage of home tests, this concern has diminished as many people are now experienced with self-collection. The focus has shifted to test performance.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How have concerns about training users to self-collect nasal swab samples evolved since the beginning of the pandemic?
VERBATIM ANSWER: I guess the only thing that I would add is, at the beginning, or earlier in the pandemic, we were concerned with users being taught how to collect a nasal swab by that health care provider prior to self-collecting. And so I think now that we have half-- excuse me-- a billion tests distributed and more on the way, I think that concern is a little bit less. So as Tim mentioned, come in with a Pre-Sub and let us know how you plan to collect those samples. But I think that information has influenced our study recommendations. So traditionally, we've been concerned about bias introduced from a health care professional collecting the sample prior to a self test. And now for home respiratory testing, at least, it's hard to imagine that there's any person left in the United States who can perform the testing on themselves or on somebody else, hasn't done a home test yet. So that pool of unbiased candidate test subjects is not available any longer, and I think people are pretty well-trained on collection and running a test.

#### 9. Guidance for Clinical Labs Pursuing Test Clearance

QA Block 9-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the FDA plan to issue specific guidance directed towards clinical laboratories pursuing a 510k or a path to clearance for their institution, specifically for cases where the SARS-CoV-2 test manufacturer is not pursuing clearance?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA encourages clinical laboratories to use the Q-Submission process, which is free, to discuss their unique cases for pursuing clearance. Guidance on the Q-Submission process is available online.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA plan to issue specific guidance directed towards clinical laboratories pursuing a 510k or a path to clearance for their institution, specifically for cases where the SARS-CoV-2 test manufacturer is not pursuing clearance?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The FDA has always welcomed lab-developed tests and labs to participate in FDA submissions, and we routinely have been authorizing such tests, even outside of an emergency response. Your specific situation has some inherent challenges, because I take it that it would still be a manufactured test. But you're not the manufacturer, unless you take on the manufacturing role for your own situation. So this is, I think, a perfect example of submitting your plans. And you can do that briefly, and if it's not enough detail, we can ask more questions. You can ask your questions and then submit that as a Pre- Submission or a Q-Submission, and there's no charge for that submission. There is a guidance out there. If you just submit “google FDA Q-Submission process,” it'll explain in detail how you do that and how you make that submission. It's just a formal way of the FDA receiving a submission electronically and logging it in and opening a file so that we have a record of our responses to you. We endeavor to hold ourselves to the words that we provide in that response to you, to your questions, for when you come back in. So it's all a matter of formal record that we can refer to, and you'll have a formal response that you can refer to as well.

VERBATIM ANSWER: So the guidance document does not terminate the 564 declaration, as we mentioned. So as we've talked about, we are recommending that developers move toward traditional marketing submissions. We are continuing to review EUA requests for a small number of submissions that meet our current priorities based on the public health needs. But we are, the 564 is still open, and the guidance document does not change that. And so we'll continue to work through the priority submissions that we are reviewing. And every developer with an EUA request that is in-house and still open will receive a response either that we are declining to review or declining to issue, or that we are authorizing it, depending on how everything goes. So you will get a response. We just can't say what that response will be at this time.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: In the final transition for existing EUAs, will developers have to switch to the de novo pathway if their test does not already have a predicate device?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA confirms that if a device does not have an appropriate predicate, developers will need to use the de novo pathway.
VERBATIM QUESTION: In the final transition for existing EUAs, will developers have to switch to the de novo pathway if their test does not already have a predicate device?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So we do have-- there are de novos granted for a couple of device types. If there is not an appropriate predicate for your particular device, then yes, it would need to go through de novo.

#### 16. Transition Guidance Unnecessary for Mpox Testing Authorization

QA Block 16-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Will there be any plans to have a COVID transition draft guidance for mpox?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA does not plan to issue a transition draft guidance for mpox as the situation is very different from COVID-19. Mpox cases are very low, making clinical studies challenging; EUA authorities remain sufficient for ensuring test availability.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Will there be any plans to have a COVID transition draft guidance for mpox?
VERBATIM ANSWER: I'll take this. So mpox is a whole lot different than COVID-19. There continue to be, in the last few days, 30,000 new cases known in the US, and may underestimate it. And we anticipate that COVID-19 will be with us probably for much longer than we hope. With mpox, there are very few cases. The last time I checked, there was 1.7 cases a day in the United States. That's probably a week-old data. And it would be super, super challenging to try to do a prospective clinical study anywhere in the world right now for mpox in order to transition EUAs to full authorization in an acceptable manner. So this is the perfect situation for the EUA authorities, where we can keep the 564 declaration in place, if we wish, in order that there is still access to testing for mpox. And we do believe that there is a continued need for mpox, and we want to have tests continue to be available. And in fact, there still are some priority categories for EUAs for mpox, and that doesn't include-- the primary category now for mpox is really a multi-analyte point-of-care mpox test that includes other commonly-seen and potentially overlapping with symptoms and presentation with mpox, STDs. But it is fairly focused and limited. But the US government is interested in continuing to have a test availability to keep pressure on keeping any sort of potential resurgence mitigated and addressed. So there isn't really a need for transition guidance, and we didn't do it for others that are still-- 564 that are open. That includes things like Zika and Ebola. And in fact, this year, we've already used the Ebola authorities to make sure that our nation-- and last year-- that our nation has appropriate countermeasures, IVD countermeasures for Ebola because of the outbreak that, fortunately, never reached our shores, but needed to be dealt with exterior to the US. But we needed to be prepared in the US for anything that might happen here.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What steps should be taken to use a comparator cleared more than five years ago for flu testing?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA may accept comparators cleared over five years ago if evidence shows test performance remains consistent with current circulating flu strains, such as through in silico analysis of primers and probes.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What steps should be taken to use a comparator cleared more than five years ago for flu testing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: However, we may consider a comparator that has been cleared previous to that time frame if you can demonstrate that the test performance is expected to remain unchanged with currently circulating flu strains; for example, providing an in silico analysis of the primers and probes, including contemporary strains.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the adjusted recommendations for developers regarding flu B prospective clinical study targets to support CLIA waiver or over-the-counter IVD indications?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA has adjusted its recommendations for flu B validation to require a target of at least 30 influenza-B-positive subjects in a prospective clinical study for CLIA waiver or OTC IVD indications, reduced from the previous 120-subject requirement.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the adjusted recommendations for developers regarding flu B prospective clinical study targets to support CLIA waiver or over-the-counter IVD indications?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Due to the low levels of flu B in the past few seasons, we are adjusting our general recommendations for developers to target at least 30 influenza-B-positive subjects in a prospective clinical study to support CLIA waiver or over-the-counter IVD indications. This differs from feedback developers may have previously received, such as in Q-Submissions. These previous recommendations for testing included a target of 120 subjects positive by the comparator method for flu B to support CLIA waiver and OTC IVD indications. Again, we encourage developers to continue engaging with us on this topic.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is it acceptable for clinical studies of an at-home antigen test to collect the comparator method test swab sample prior to the candidate test swab sample?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Yes, it is acceptable as long as standard of care procedures, including IRB recommendations, are followed. Pausing between collections, such as a 15-minute interval, is also reasonable. This can be addressed through the pre-EUA or Q-Sub process if needed.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is it acceptable for clinical studies of an at-home antigen test to collect the comparator method test swab sample prior to the candidate test swab sample?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. You do need to follow standard of care procedures per IRB recommendations, when appropriate. That can be a molecular rather than, necessarily, an antigen test. But obviously, it takes longer to get that molecular result back than an on-site antigen test. You can pause between collections, particularly between the molecular comparator collection and the candidate test collection, to allow what we call a washout period. Or we've seen in developers, sponsors of studies wait 15 minutes in between collections, and to date I'm not aware of any challenges that put any of the comparisons at a disadvantage. And you can also address this, if you wish, through, if it's an EUA submission, through the pre-EUA process or a Q-Sub if it's for a full authorization process.
