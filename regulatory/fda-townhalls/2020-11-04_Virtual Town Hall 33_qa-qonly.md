#### 1. False Positive Risks in Antigen Test Reporting

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What steps can clinical laboratories take to ensure accurate handling and storage of antigen test cartridges or cards?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Clinical laboratories should follow the package insert instructions regarding handling and storage of test cartridges or cards, ensuring proper timing for reading results, and minimizing cross contamination by adhering to CDC PPE guidelines, glove changes, and cleaning protocols.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What steps can clinical laboratories take to ensure accurate handling and storage of antigen test cartridges or cards?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So a few of the key points there are to be aware of the information in the package insert for each test, which does include information about appropriate handling of the test cartridge or card -- excuse me -- at appropriate storage of those components. If they're not handled properly that can impact the performance of the test. And also about the time that it takes to read the results and being sure to read the results at the appropriate time since reading the test before or after that timeframe, can result in false positive or false negative results. We also include some information about minimizing the risk of cross contamination and pointing to the CDC guidance and recommendations about the use of PPE and changing gloves and also cleaning the instrument and the work area in between specimens.

#### 5. Post Authorization Requirements for Archived Specimens in Studies

QA Block 5-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the post authorization requirements if we use archived specimens to support an asymptomatic claim in a study for the new antigen template?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Post authorization requirements depend on the review and any outstanding questions. There is no blanket policy that archived specimens must trigger a post market study, but potential sample biases might require further studies.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the post authorization requirements if we use archived specimens to support an asymptomatic claim in a study for the new antigen template?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So I mean typically, we'll have a post authorization study if there's some kind of open questions at the end of your submission. So if there are - I think, you know, during the review, you know, this is a very detailed question, right? I think there are a lot of aspects to what go into a post market study or not. And so I would tend to leave that up to the individual reviewer. And I would say there's not kind of a blanket policy. So yes, if you use archived you must have a post market study. I don't think that is the approach. I think there are maybe some deficiencies that could be identified because we know that archived sample are, you know, or can be at least, somewhat of a biased population. So if there are those questions at the end of the study then, you know, that may be applicable for a kind of post market approach, a post authorization approach. Excuse me.

REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 6-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: If we have an EUA approved molecular test and want to change the sample collection method, such as switching from nasal swabs to saliva, how should we proceed?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA provides recommendations for validating saliva as a specimen type in its molecular template. If you are the EUA holder, you must submit a supplemental EUA request with validation data. If using another entity's test, the FDA expects validation based on its template and guidance without requiring a new EUA. Saliva collection devices must already be authorized or require separate authorization.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If we have an EUA approved molecular test and want to change the sample collection method, such as switching from nasal swabs to saliva, how should we proceed?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So we do have recommendations in the molecular template for validation of saliva including validating adding saliva as a specimen to a test that has been already validated for nasal specimens. In terms of the regulatory approach, is this your own EUA that you're - that you are the EUA holder and you'll need to add saliva, or are you a laboratory that is looking to add saliva testing to a commercial test kit? We were going to use somebody else's EUA but we can do it as an LDT too. I mean we could poke around that way. But and if you can marry the two and just do a verification in the - I guess of the LDT. Yes. So - right, so if you're - if you're looking to add saliva as a specimen type to an EUA authorization, we would just ask that you submit - the EUA holder should submit a supplemental EUA request including the validation that we recommend in the template for saliva. And then that could be added provided that the data supports it. It could be added to the authorization. For a lab looking to add saliva as a specimen type to another entity's authorized test, we would also hope that you would use the FDA recommendations for validation that are in the template. We have indicated in our guidance and there's also the HHS LDT statement, that we would not expect to see an EUA request for that modification. But we would expect it to be done - for the saliva collection to be done with a legally marketed saliva collection device. The collection device otherwise would need to come in for authorization if it's not one that is already authorized.

TOPICS: EUA modifications, Sample collection methods, Validation requirements
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 6-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Do we need to submit a brand new EUA, or can a bridging study or verification study be used to change the sample collection part of an approved molecular test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends submitting a supplemental EUA request with required validations to add a new sample collection type like saliva to a test authorized for nasal swabs. For laboratories adding saliva testing to an authorized test, the modification does not require a new EUA but must follow FDA's validation recommendations with a legally marketed collection device.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Do we need to submit a brand new EUA, or can a bridging study or verification study be used to change the sample collection part of an approved molecular test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We do have recommendations in the molecular template for validation of saliva including validating adding saliva as a specimen to a test that has been already validated for nasal specimens. In terms of the regulatory approach, is this your own EUA that you're - that you are the EUA holder and you'll need to add saliva, or are you a laboratory that is looking to add saliva testing to a commercial test kit? So - right, so if you're - if you're looking to add saliva as a specimen type to an EUA authorization, we would just ask that you submit - the EUA holder should submit a supplemental EUA request including the validation that we recommend in the template for saliva.

QA Block 6-5
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the regulatory approach if a laboratory wants to add saliva testing to a commercial test kit authorized under another entity's EUA?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: A lab adding saliva testing to another entity's EUA-authorized test should use FDA's validation recommendations in the template. FDA does not require a new EUA request but expects use of a legally marketed saliva collection device, or obtaining authorization for the device if not already authorized.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the regulatory approach if a laboratory wants to add saliva testing to a commercial test kit authorized under another entity's EUA?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So - right, so if you're - if you're looking to add saliva as a specimen type to an EUA authorization, we would just ask that you submit - the EUA holder should submit a supplemental EUA request including the validation that we recommend in the template for saliva. And then that could be added provided that the data supports it. It could be added to the authorization. For a lab looking to add saliva as a specimen type to another entity's authorized test, we would also hope that you would use the FDA recommendations for validation that are in the template. We have indicated in our guidance and there's also the HHS LDT statement, that we would not expect to see an EUA request for that modification. But we would expect it to be done - for the saliva collection to be done with a legally marketed saliva collection device. The collection device otherwise would need to come in for authorization if it's not one that is already authorized.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Can a saliva collection device be part of another test kit or does it have to be standalone?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So some test kits have that in the collection device built into that EUA and some collection devices have an EUA just as standalone. As a matter of fact, a collection device that is included in - within an EUA for an assay, then that collection device is only authorized for use with that assay. In order for a collection device to be more broadly legally marketed it has to have that standalone authorization.

VERBATIM ANSWER: Thank you for that. That's an important clarification. And I know that we do try to use molecular as a more general term typically. But absolutely, we do refer to PCR tests at times when molecular may be more appropriate. If you have specific recommendations where you see information is put out and you think that we should change some of our wording, you can definitely send that in. If you can send that in to the mailbox in writing with your recommended edits that is incredibly helpful for us. And we will definitely take a look at that.

QA Block 6-6
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does adding saliva testing to another entity's authorized test require an EUA request?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA does not expect an EUA request for adding saliva to another entity's authorized test, but the saliva collection must use a legally marketed saliva collection device or one separately authorized.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does adding saliva testing to another entity's authorized test require an EUA request?
VERBATIM ANSWER: For a lab looking to add saliva as a specimen type to another entity's authorized test, we would also hope that you would use the FDA recommendations for validation that are in the template. We have indicated in our guidance and there's also the HHS LDT statement, that we would not expect to see an EUA request for that modification. But we would expect it to be done - for the saliva collection to be done with a legally marketed saliva collection device. The collection device otherwise would need to come in for authorization if it's not one that is already authorized.

QA Block 11-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: If validation is required for the sterility check for VTM, how should it be approached?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends submitting your protocol for feedback since there are multiple approaches to evaluating sterility.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If validation is required for the sterility check for VTM, how should it be approached?
VERBATIM ANSWER: I think, you know, if you have a protocol in mind I think we'd be glad to comment on it. We have done that in the past. But just keep in mind, I think there are, you know, multiple ways to take a look at sterility.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Lindsay Miles
SPEAKER ANSWER: Kris Roth (FDA)
TOPICS: sterility evaluation, FDA feedback, VTM validation
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 11-5
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What does the FDA consider an appropriate statistical approach to evaluating sterility?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Sterility is evaluated statistically, based on the amount and duration of VTM testing. The FDA intentionally does not provide specific recommendations due to the flexibility of approaches but can provide feedback on proposed protocols.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What does the FDA consider an appropriate statistical approach to evaluating sterility?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. Just briefly, you know, sterility is a statistical evaluation. Right? So it's just a matter of how long and how much of the VTM you test. So I think that's perhaps why we're not having a kind of a concrete recommendation in that notification guidance because it's not - I think there's multiple ways that it could be done. And so as Toby mentioned, I think, you know, if you have a protocol in mind I think we'd be glad to comment on it. We have done that in the past. But just keep in mind, I think there are, you know, multiple ways to take a look at sterility.
