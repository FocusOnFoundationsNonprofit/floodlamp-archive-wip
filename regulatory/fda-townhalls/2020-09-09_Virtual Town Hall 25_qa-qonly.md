#### 1. FDA Updates on COVID-19 Test Development Progress

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What does proper use of a right of reference entail when leveraging existing validation data?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA has updated its FAQ page to provide more information on properly using a right of reference when leveraging validation data already reviewed for another test.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What does proper use of a right of reference entail when leveraging existing validation data?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We added a new question-and-answer to our FAQ page and updated a few of the existing questions. The new question is regarding leveraging validation data that has already been reviewed by the FDA for another test. We've had a lot of questions about the proper way to do that and proper way to use or right of reference. So we added some additional information about that to the question.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: Right of reference, Validation data, FDA guidelines
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-2

TOPICS: FAQ updates, CDC singleplex test, Extraction platforms
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How can developers use banked samples effectively for pre-market validation of point of care tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA supports the use of banked samples for pre-market validation of point-of-care tests if appropriate for the technology. Developers should collaborate with FDA to create a study plan that closely mimics the clinical setting for accurate performance assessment.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How can developers use banked samples effectively for pre-market validation of point of care tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We would like to further assist developers in the pre-market validation period by opening, further opening up the chance for developers to use banked samples for their point of care studies. If the technology is amenable to that where they can use banked samples, then that may be a very good approach pre-market. We do ask that and work with the member of our team to define your study plan because we would like to mimic as near as possible those samples being handed off to a point of care tester in a manner similar to which they would normally see patients in the clinic and do an actual prospective collection and test so that we can mimic a busy clinical workplace and assess the performance of the test.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Banked samples, Point of care tests, Pre-market validation
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the FDA's recommendations for matching symptomatic samples to asymptomatic cases in pre-market studies?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends a minimum of 10 asymptomatic patients pre-market. If 20 are required, 10 can be symptomatic samples matched for viral loads or CTs. For 30 asymptomatic samples, 15 can be supplemented pre-market with symptomatic ones.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the FDA's recommendations for matching symptomatic samples to asymptomatic cases in pre-market studies?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We also would like to start something new. Again, this is a pre-market validation assistance. We're open to, in addition to having a minimum number of asymptomatic patients pre-market, sometimes it's only as few as 10 or 20. We ask there be a minimum of 10 asymptomatic patients enrolled and tested. If in the case that 20 maybe required which is the most common number of samples that are asymptomatic to be required, we'll allow a minimum of 10 pre-market and the other 10 could be matched symptomatic samples and the matching process should be worked out with a member of our team but in general we'll be trying to find samples that reflect the viral loads, or CTs, or viral levels of those 10 asymptomatic patients who have been enrolled. If the requirement is for more than 20 asymptomatic which is in some cases where developers only want to seek an asymptomatic claim, there may be requirements for 30 asymptomatic samples and we are going to allow 15 of those 30 to be supplemented by symptomatic in the pre-market.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Pre-market studies, Sample matching, Validation for asymptomatic claims
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-5
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the minimum number of pre-market asymptomatic samples required for asymptomatic or over-the-counter claim validations?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA requires a minimum of 10 pre-market asymptomatic patients, with up to 20 samples needed in some cases. For claims requiring 20 samples, 10 of these can be matched symptomatic samples. For claims requiring 30 samples, 15 can be supplemented by symptomatic samples.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the minimum number of pre-market asymptomatic samples required for asymptomatic or over-the-counter claim validations?

TOPICS: asymptomatic sample requirements, validation studies, pre-market claims
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-6
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What additional post-market requirements might be expected for point of care and asymptomatic claims?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Post-market studies may be required for authorizations relating to point of care and asymptomatic claims, allowing developers sufficient time to complete these studies. FDA suggests leveraging large screening or surveillance programs to accumulate asymptomatic samples.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What additional post-market requirements might be expected for point of care and asymptomatic claims?
VERBATIM ANSWER: With regard to point of care tests, we would like to further assist developers in the pre-market validation period by opening, further opening up the chance for developers to use banked samples for their point of care studies. If the technology is amenable to that where they can use banked samples, then that may be a very good approach pre-market. We do ask that and work with the member of our team to define your study plan because we would like to mimic as near as possible those samples being handed off to a point of care tester in a manner similar to which they would normally see patients in the clinic and do an actual prospective collection and test so that we can mimic a busy clinical workplace and assess the performance of the test. So that is the loosening, further loosening under an EUA situation pre-market. There may, of course, be some post-market studies that are likely to be part of such an authorization. Similarly, we have heard from a lot of developers that accumulating asymptomatic samples for asymptomatic claims or over-the-counter tests has been a little bit more challenging than expected. So there are two ways that we suggest that can aid in the accumulation of asymptomatic patients. One is to team up with any of the large screening and/or surveillance programs, I'm looking at large populations. Of course, this is being done on many college campuses across the country. And if they identify a patient in their screening or surveillance, that's potentially a perfect opportunity to enroll that patient or that residual sample into the clinical study for asymptomatic claims.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Post-market requirements, Point of care tests, Asymptomatic sample collection
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-7
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What strategies can be used to recruit asymptomatic individuals or samples for validation studies?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA suggests teaming up with large screening or surveillance programs, such as those on college campuses, to identify patients or residual samples for validation studies. Banked samples or callback collections for positives can also be leveraged.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What strategies can be used to recruit asymptomatic individuals or samples for validation studies?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Similarly, we have heard from a lot of developers that accumulating asymptomatic samples for asymptomatic claims or over-the-counter tests has been a little bit more challenging than expected. So there are two ways that we suggest that can aid in the accumulation of asymptomatic patients. One is to team up with any of the large screening and/or surveillance programs, I'm looking at large populations. Of course, this is being done on many college campuses across the country. And if they identify a patient in their screening or surveillance, that's potentially a perfect opportunity to enroll that patient or that residual sample into the clinical study for asymptomatic claims. So that can be accomplished in a number of different ways. One is that it's banked samples can be used for your device from those testing efforts. And you can simply of all your local authorizations are achieved to use that sample for development of a commercial product allowed then you can use that banked sample. The other thing you can do is potentially call back any positives for re-collection. So we have been working with recently, very recently, with some who have tried to utilize this approach. And there has been some success in this. So we wanted to make that further awareness available to all developers.

QA Block 1-8
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is it acceptable to use serial testing strategies with less sensitive tests for home testing scenarios?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is open to using serial testing strategies with less sensitive tests for home testing scenarios. For instance, these tests can achieve higher sensitivity when used over multiple days.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is it acceptable to use serial testing strategies with less sensitive tests for home testing scenarios?
VERBATIM ANSWER: There could be significant trade-offs and test accuracy that maybe appropriate where the need for availability and fast results is not being met. So for one example where our recommended levels of sensitivity may not be achieved with a single test result in a home situation, maybe with the paper strip test. Strategies utilizing serial testing, for less sensitive tests, could be deployed. Regarding serial testing, I mentioned this last week I believe. For example, what if the test had a 70 percent sensitivity? I also want to go into further detail about what we mean by 70 percent sensitivity. Let's just say that 70 percent sensitivity is what can be achieved with one test result. Well perhaps with a two-pack, two test results you can achieve a greater sensitivity together and maybe on a day one, day two, or day one, day three strategy. So the sensitivities can be such that one or the other being positive gives you a positive result. We are open to that kind of testing format to see that we're capturing, and this is where I'll go in to what we mean by sensitivity.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Serial testing, Home testing scenarios, Test sensitivity
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-9
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How does the FDA define 70 percent sensitivity in the context of serial testing for COVID tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA defines 70 percent sensitivity as the sensitivity achievable with a single test result. Through serial testing, such as using two tests across different days, the combined sensitivity can be improved. Testing formats where either result being positive indicates positivity are acceptable.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How does the FDA define 70 percent sensitivity in the context of serial testing for COVID tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: For example, what if the test had a 70 percent sensitivity? I also want to go into further detail about what we mean by 70 percent sensitivity.

REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-10
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the FDA's current position on trade-offs between test accuracy and availability for certain use cases?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA acknowledges trade-offs between test accuracy and availability. For instance, tests with lower sensitivity, such as paper strip tests, may be acceptable in home settings when combined with strategies like serial testing to improve overall sensitivity.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the FDA's current position on trade-offs between test accuracy and availability for certain use cases?
VERBATIM ANSWER: There could be significant trade-offs and test accuracy that maybe appropriate where the need for availability and fast results is not being met.

We are open to that kind of testing format to see that we're capturing, and this is where I'll go in to what we mean by sensitivity. In some senses, the absolute LOD of an assay doesn't matter as much especially in this home situation where you're trying to find folks who are carrying a level of virus that can infect others.

TOPICS: Test accuracy vs availability, Home testing strategies, Serial testing approach
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-11
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What new options are the FDA offering for pre-market validation assistance regarding asymptomatic claims?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA is offering flexibility for pre-market validation of asymptomatic claims by allowing developers to enroll a minimum of 10 asymptomatic patients pre-market and supplement required samples with matched symptomatic samples. Additional samples might be completed post-market.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What new options are the FDA offering for pre-market validation assistance regarding asymptomatic claims?

Again, with the point of care studies there maybe requirements post-market to bring the total up to the recommended amounts. In both cases, we will obviously allow enough time for those studies to be completed post-market.

REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-12
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What thresholds or performance measures are acceptable for less sensitive tests during peak virus shedding periods?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA suggests that during peak virus shedding periods, tests with lower sensitivity can be acceptable if paired with strategies like serial testing (e.g., a two-pack with tests on consecutive days) to enhance overall sensitivity. Sensitivity thresholds should ensure adequate detection during the first 5 to 7 days of peak infectiousness, even if some less sensitive tests perform well only within this window.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What thresholds or performance measures are acceptable for less sensitive tests during peak virus shedding periods?
VERBATIM ANSWER: There could be significant trade-offs and test accuracy that maybe appropriate where the need for availability and fast results is not being met. So for one example where our recommended levels of sensitivity may not be achieved with a single test result in a home situation, maybe with the paper strip test.

We are open to that kind of testing format to see that we're capturing, and this is where I'll go in to what we mean by sensitivity. In some senses, the absolute LOD of an assay doesn't matter as much especially in this home situation where you're trying to find folks who are carrying a level of virus that can infect others. So we typically think for symptomatic patients that the first five to seven days are some of the peak days for potential for infecting others with the virus. There's in all likelihood a very similar window for those who are without symptoms who are infected to start shedding virus and then eventually tail-off and are no longer shedding significant or any virus. We are really looking and as we've authorized our direct antigen tests, some of them have been authorized for five days post-symptoms because those are either the days that were studied in a clinical trial or those are the days at which performance was high enough to authorize. So some less sensitive tests may fall off more quickly after that five day period. That can be OK. We do want to see adequate sensitivity during those peak periods of virus shedding when patients are at most risk of being able to infect others. We think that by identification, of course, those individuals and isolating them, and treating them as needed we can do great good in reducing the incidence of new cases in the U.S.

QA Block 1-13
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the FDA have specific recommendations for developers submitting two-pack or sequential home testing kits?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is open to strategies like serial testing for home kits with less sensitive results. Developers can improve sensitivity by using a two-pack test format on a day one, day two or day one, day three schedule, where one positive result confirms a diagnosis.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA have specific recommendations for developers submitting two-pack or sequential home testing kits?

#### 3. FDA Flexibility on Using Multiple Comparator Assay Systems

QA Block 3-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the FDA's stance on using multiple high-sensitivity RT-PCR assay systems as comparators for rapid antigen test clinical performance validation?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is flexible regarding the use of multiple high-sensitivity RT-PCR systems as comparators for antigen test validation, provided EUA-authorized molecular tests are used. Labs can use local tests, and discordant results can be resolved with additional tests in consultation with the FDA. Corrected results may require pre-specified algorithms and multiple assays upfront.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the FDA's stance on using multiple high-sensitivity RT-PCR assay systems as comparators for rapid antigen test clinical performance validation?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, we're absolutely flexible to accommodate that situation. Really only our recommendation is that you use EUA authorized high-sensitivity molecular tests. Though we understand that different centers would have different local tests that you can use as the comparator. You can also use multiple tests to annotate your tables so there might not be an ideal comparator but you can do discordant resolution with another test. Do discuss resolution with your contact at the FDA so that it's done in the appropriate way. And then at the very least the tables in the extractions for us can be updated with that annotated data. Depending on how you do the comparator and what you use for your reference method, it may or may not be able to have corrected results. There are opportunities to use corrected results, but then it does require multiple upfront comparator assays and a pre-specify reference algorithm in order to do that and use combination of tests as a reference method.

#### 6. Requirements for Expanding Asymptomatic Testing Authorization

QA Block 6-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the essential requirement for the EUA authorization to test asymptomatic people?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: To add testing for asymptomatic individuals to an existing EUA, 20 positive asymptomatic samples must be collected in an unbiased manner, not cherry-picked, and their performance compared to accepted recommendations. Alternative pathways may involve historical CT comparisons.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the essential requirement for the EUA authorization to test asymptomatic people?
VERBATIM ANSWER: It's already authorized and you want to add asymptomatic to your intended use. I believe we ask for 20 positive asymptomatics. We want those to be collected in an un-biased way and not cherry-picking way. They just require those 20 and that you show that that's comparative performance to the accepted recommendations.

#### 8. Challenges and Considerations for Saliva-Based Rapid Antigen Tests

QA Block 8-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Would FDA consider saliva samples and matched PCR results sufficient for validation?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA is open to using banked, including frozen, saliva samples but requires comparison to fresh samples to ensure consistent accuracy. The use of saliva samples should meet data-driven validation criteria and requires further discussion for detailed feedback.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Would FDA consider saliva samples and matched PCR results sufficient for validation?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So in a point of care setting, I did mention earlier in this session that we're open to using banked samples and that could include frozen. Typically when frozen samples are used, we want to know how the frozen samples compare to fresh samples because the fresh samples are what would be used in a natural point of care setting or home setting. There could be situations where samples either degraded or viruses made more accessible by freezing. We have actually interestingly enough seen situations where we think freezing of a sample actually improved sensitivity but it's obviously not in a standard workflow situation for any sort of routine testing to first freeze the sample before you test it. So we do want to understand those parameters. We would probably want to see some minimal number of fresh samples in addition to banked samples. So I think some of the details should be discussed with a member of our team to give you a very specific feedback.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Can you comment specifically on the use of saliva for a rapid home antigen test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. So certainly open to saliva use in any test situation whether at the home, non-lab, point of care or other as long as it works. So we have heard from the numerous developers who have not been able to make saliva work for the direct antigen test. So if you can do it, more power to you. We make our decisions based on data and not on pre-ordained facts. So it still fascinates me that it's oral fluid and saliva can work as well as they can in some cases for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infections.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What sensitivity or limit of detection (LoD) would be needed to consider saliva acceptable for antigen testing?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is open to considering tests with lower sensitivity if used in combination to achieve adequate overall sensitivity. Tests must effectively detect individuals in the peak period of viral transmissibility to prevent false negatives.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What sensitivity or limit of detection (LoD) would be needed to consider saliva acceptable for antigen testing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. As we have mentioned in our templates and as we mentioned and I have mentioned in the opinion contribution to The Hill this morning, we are open to single tests that are less sensitive if in combination They provide adequate sensitivity. I mean the most important thing is if someone has viral levels that could be contagious, could infect somebody else. We're not talking about rare occurrence weeks after infection with very, very low potential viral level. We're talking about peak period of viral transmissibility. We want to see good performance in that window because otherwise people would get a false sense of security from a negative result. So if combination of two tests, three tests over one to three or so days improves your sensitivity so that we're making sure that we capture a significantly number of who can transmit virus, then we're open to that.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Does testing a multi-pack over several days affect whether saliva is considered acceptable for antigen testing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. As we have mentioned in our templates and as we mentioned and I have mentioned in the opinion contribution to The Hill this morning, we are open to single tests that are less sensitive if in combination They provide adequate sensitivity.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What viral load is important for detection to ensure capturing infectious cases?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is analyzing data like CT results to determine detection standards but emphasizes that the infectious period, typically within the first seven days post-symptoms, is critical for evaluating performance.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What viral load is important for detection to ensure capturing infectious cases?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Well, we're starting to look at the available information we have for say CT results. CT results and the CAP has come out with an article saying it's really hard to make these tests truly quantitative. There's all sorts of factors that go into there. Probably the most important factor is adequate sample, and then there's biology. So but we have seen very high CT, for some of the submission in the first few days of post-symptoms. That was a little bit surprising to us. So a simple cut off for CT may not be sufficient for performance evaluation in that situation. So again we're data driven. We understand the typical course of infection and the infectivity, and it usually means that in the prescribed seven days after symptoms have initiated in a patient they can be considered potentially infectious obviously.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Do you have a specific viral particle concentration range (e.g., 10^3 to 10^5 viral particles per ml) that should be detectable to capture the early infectious stage?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA does not have a specific viral particle concentration range due to challenges with respiratory specimen testing and lack of an international standard. Detection focus is largely on clinical study performance in comparison to a high sensitivity molecular test.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Do you have a specific viral particle concentration range (e.g., 10^3 to 10^5 viral particles per ml) that should be detectable to capture the early infectious stage?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. So LoD is really, really, really tough to get at and there is not an international standard. There's not a really good way to assess that. There's not a really good way to get a great sample every time. I was involved in the early days of real-time quantitative PCR development and FDA authorization for an HIV quant, HCV, HPV quant assays. When you have a blood sample which is pretty uniform, and you have a highly sensitive and linear molecular test which is real-time test that's more well-developed, well-validated, You can start to really specify what levels matter. It's very challenging with the respiratory specimen to do that. So we remain open and flexible. LoD is not primarily the determining factor in whether we authorize a test for the detection of virus or viral RNA. It's largely the clinical study where in comparison to, for the period that you're looking at, compared to a high sensitivity molecular test which provides the reference result for those say early days of post-infection to know whether a patient is infected or not with a SARS-CoV-2 or they have something else. So that more establishes the truth of the infection rather than the level of the infection.

VERBATIM QUESTION: At what point should a developer consider setting up a pre-EUA consultation with the FDA?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So we have provided a lot of recommendations in our templates and to say save precious time we urge those recommendations to be reviewed. It would really be those questions that aren't directly addressed in those templates where there's the most value that we can add. So I think the authorization has been made with direct antigen tests already in the first five days of symptoms, they're the first two that were authorized, I think we're authorized for five days. Those were sufficient performance in the symptomatic population.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is handling a high volume of EUA submissions and prioritizes cases that impact public health most. The time taken does not imply problems or rejection for a specific test.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If an EUA is outside the 90-day review period, is it safe to assume the test was problematic or rejected?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We are absolutely inundated in submissions. It's why early on back in March, we basically really opened up so that developers could within a certain timeframe after notification for many purposes, not all purposes could -- once they notify begin marketing their test in the U.S. while we do our review. Because there are so many we have had to determine a triage process and that triage process does move high priority tests ahead of others because either they require an EUA to be marketed for their intended use or they are going to have a bigger impact on public health. All the while for those that are allowed to notify, they can market. We do -- we attempt to do a really quick check on all submission, EUA submissions to make sure there are no issues of public health concern and if they are, we tend to try to deal with those as quickly as possible obviously.

Developers are encouraged to consider ways to facilitate public health reporting, but this is not mandated for EUA approval.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Have the FDA's requirements regarding reporting home saliva test results to authorities like the CDC been amended?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. So I'll take the home saliva and or any other home tests that isn't performed in a healthcare facility or any facility that doesn't have a CLIA certificate. Any entity that has a CLIA laboratory certificate is obviously required to report at least positive and negative results for COVID-19. In the home testing situation or non-lab testing situation where the testing is performed and allowed in a non-CLIA certificate setting, home would be perfect for this example. There is not a requirement under law that I'm aware of to report that result for public health purposes. However, there's great advantage from there being a way to facilitate the reporting of that result. So we do have in our template not as an EUA authorization requirement. We do have questions around what thought the developers have given to how home test users for example could report results. Some are way ahead of the curve here and they want to help out as best as they can, and they actually have apps or they have a device that's connected that could actually easily report these results. So but there are those who have very simple, paper strip tests where it may not be as easy. I know there are those in the U.S. government that are looking at ways to facilitate reporting in those situations.

VERBATIM ANSWER: There is not a requirement under law that I'm aware of to report that result for public health purposes. However, there's great advantage from there being a way to facilitate the reporting of that result. So we do have in our template not as an EUA authorization requirement. We do have questions around what thought the developers have given to how home test users for example could report results. Some are way ahead of the curve here and they want to help out as best as they can, and they actually have apps or they have a device that's connected that could actually easily report these results. So but there are those who have very simple, paper strip tests where it may not be as easy. I know there are those in the U.S. government that are looking at ways to facilitate reporting in those situations. So again this is not something that we are asking as a review criteria to make a decision on an authorization for developers but we do welcome the ideas that developers have about how they can facilitate the reporting of the important results for public health purposes.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA prioritizes EUA submissions that are required for marketing a test for its intended use or those that have a significant impact on public health.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What criteria make an EUA submission high priority for review by the FDA?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Because there are so many we have had to determine a triage process and that triage process does move high priority tests ahead of others because either they require an EUA to be marketed for their intended use or they are going to have a bigger impact on public health.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Does submitting an EUA notification allow a developer to market their test before FDA review completion?
VERBATIM ANSWER: It's why early on back in March, we basically really opened up so that developers could within a certain timeframe after notification for many purposes, not all purposes could -- once they notify begin marketing their test in the U.S. while we do our review. Because there are so many we have had to determine a triage process and that triage process does move high priority tests ahead of others because either they require an EUA to be marketed for their intended use or they are going to have a bigger impact on public health.

#### 11. Post-Market Validation and Flexibility in FDA Requirements

QA Block 11-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can you elaborate on post-market validation?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Post-market validation involves various commitments, such as monitoring pooling claims or completing studies not finished pre-market. FDA provides flexibility pre-market but may require study completion post-market, with negotiated study designs and timelines.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can you elaborate on post-market validation?
VERBATIM ANSWER: There are several situations where there can be post-market commitments. One is for any pooling claims. A pooling sensitivities can vary over time if the patient viral load shifts one way or the other. So in all pooling authorizations, we do have a monitoring plan that is a post-market commitment, that's not necessarily a completion of validation. And others, such as I mentioned in early antigen tests where to add a direct swab we only require pre-market a five swab study. They can have 30 VTM samples for that. This is just some example there are other similar or dissimilar types of post-market commitments. But then the company agreed under the authorization to complete 30 direct swabs which they then did and they updated their intended use with the full 30 plus, and if they had more than 30 in the end, they updated the IFU with the performance data on those direct swab samples. I think in that case, they actually removed their VTM form the label. So we try to be maximally flexible in what we require pre-market. So sometimes in offering that flexibility, we do ask for completion of the intended recommended studies post-market. They weren't able to be completed as usually recommended in the pre-market setting. Those studies are usually, there are some negotiation on what that study design is and what the time period is. Those should be very relevant to the question at hand and to the estimated amount of time that it would take to complete those things. Hopefully, that answers your question.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is there a scenario where the sample size requirement for EUA testing would be higher than the recommended number?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is generally firm on the minimum sample size recommendation of 30 positives and 30 negatives, but they consider specific circumstances and allow flexibility in sample type or approach. Additional samples might be required for certain cases with a post-market commitment.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is there a scenario where the sample size requirement for EUA testing would be higher than the recommended number?
VERBATIM ANSWER: As far as the minimum recommended number of positives and negatives, we're pretty firm on that but we're flexible on as I mentioned earlier on how we actually approach that. Early on, we allowed contrived samples and then we shifted to using actual patient samples when the numbers of samples were sufficient out there in the marketplace and in the community to be able to specimen, the recommended amount of 30 positives. Negatives are obviously very easy to get, 30 positives, can sometimes be challenging for some new developers who don't have the connections in the community. A number of developers have found that using certain commercial organizations, and CROs, to be able to provide those samples has been helpful to them. There's also a number of ways to collaborate with clinics and hospitals, and academic centers but we can flexible to some degree on the sample type. So one of the first direct antigen tests really wanted to have a direct swab claim but they had adequate performance on VTM. So we are able to authorize the test on VTM and then later on they were able to collect enough of the direct swab to update their label for use of just the direct swab. So we want to approach things in as flexible manner as we can. So there may be some details or specifics about a specific sample type that be more challenging to acquire. So in some cases, we have allowed a minimum number of samples to be tested for an additional sample type in addition to something else that had the 30 positives to go into the intended use with the post-market commitment. So again we try to take as flexible approach as we can even given that the bars are really, the recommended bars are really quite low.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA emphasizes that an adequate sample is critical, along with understanding biology, as factors like CT cutoff values may not suffice for performance evaluation. Infectivity is mostly considered during the seven days after symptom onset.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What constitutes an adequate sample collection for tests aiming to evaluate infectious viral levels?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Well, we're starting to look at the available information we have for say CT results. CT results and the CAP has come out with an article saying it's really hard to make these tests truly quantitative. There's all sorts of factors that go into there. Probably the most important factor is adequate sample, and then there's biology. So but we have seen very high CT, for some of the submission in the first few days of post-symptoms. That was a little bit surprising to us. So a simple cut off for CT may not be sufficient for performance evaluation in that situation. So again we're data driven. We understand the typical course of infection and the infectivity, and it usually means that in the prescribed seven days after symptoms have initiated in a patient they can be considered potentially infectious obviously.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: How should developers evaluate and adjust their tests to ensure good performance during the peak period of viral transmissibility?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA advises developers to ensure good performance of tests during the peak viral transmissibility period to prevent false negatives. Using a combination of multiple tests over a period of one to three days is acceptable if it increases sensitivity to detect transmissible cases.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How should developers evaluate and adjust their tests to ensure good performance during the peak period of viral transmissibility?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. As we have mentioned in our templates and as we mentioned and I have mentioned in the opinion contribution to The Hill this morning, we are open to single tests that are less sensitive if in combination They provide adequate sensitivity. I mean the most important thing is if someone has viral levels that could be contagious, could infect somebody else. We're not talking about rare occurrence weeks after infection with very, very low potential viral level. We're talking about peak period of viral transmissibility. We want to see good performance in that window because otherwise people would get a false sense of security from a negative result. So if combination of two tests, three tests over one to three or so days improves your sensitivity so that we're making sure that we capture a significantly number of who can transmit virus, then we're open to that.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA acknowledges challenges in using CT values for test validation, citing variability in factors like sample quality and biological differences. Simple CT cutoffs may not be sufficient; evaluation should consider data-driven infection and infectivity patterns.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How should test developers address challenges in comparing CT values across diverse respiratory specimens during test validation?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Well, we're starting to look at the available information we have for say CT results. CT results and the CAP has come out with an article saying it's really hard to make these tests truly quantitative. There's all sorts of factors that go into there. Probably the most important factor is adequate sample, and then there's biology. So but we have seen very high CT, for some of the submission in the first few days of post-symptoms. That was a little bit surprising to us. So a simple cut off for CT may not be sufficient for performance evaluation in that situation. So again we're data driven. We understand the typical course of infection and the infectivity, and it usually means that in the prescribed seven days after symptoms have initiated in a patient they can be considered potentially infectious obviously.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: How many asymptomatic samples would the FDA require for pre-market testing versus post-market commitments for a new assay?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA requires as few as 10 asymptomatic samples pre-market, with a post-market commitment to gather additional samples.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How many asymptomatic samples would the FDA require for pre-market testing versus post-market commitments for a new assay?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We are trying to deal with very complicated situation. Typically an assay that performs very well in the first five days post-symptoms then we just want to see if you want to go after an asymptomatic situation and we just want to see how it really does perform in an asymptomatic population. As I said before, we're willing to go as low as 10 asymptomatic samples pre-market with the post-market commitment to fill in the rest.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What alternative approaches can be used for assessing sensitivity and limit of detection (LoD) in respiratory specimens given the lack of international standards?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA emphasizes flexibility regarding LoD assessment for respiratory specimens due to the lack of international standards. Instead of focusing solely on LoD, the FDA prioritizes clinical studies comparing test performance to a highly sensitive molecular reference test during early post-infection stages.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What alternative approaches can be used for assessing sensitivity and limit of detection (LoD) in respiratory specimens given the lack of international standards?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. So LoD is really, really, really tough to get at and there is not an international standard. There's not a really good way to assess that. There's not a really good way to get a great sample every time. I was involved in the early days of real-time quantitative PCR development and FDA authorization for an HIV quant, HCV, HPV quant assays. When you have a blood sample which is pretty uniform, and you have a highly sensitive and linear molecular test which is real-time test that's more well-developed, well-validated, You can start to really specify what levels matter. It's very challenging with the respiratory specimen to do that. So we remain open and flexible. LoD is not primarily the determining factor in whether we authorize a test for the detection of virus or viral RNA. It's largely the clinical study where in comparison to, for the period that you're looking at, compared to a high sensitivity molecular test which provides the reference result for those say early days of post-infection to know whether a patient is infected or not with a SARS-CoV-2 or they have something else. So that more establishes the truth of the infection rather than the level of the infection.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: How does the FDA prioritize EUA submissions in its triage process?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA triages EUA submissions by prioritizing high-priority tests that require EUA to be marketed or have a significant public health impact. They also perform quick checks on submissions to address public health concerns swiftly, while still allowing developers to market tests after notification.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How does the FDA prioritize EUA submissions in its triage process?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We are absolutely inundated in submissions. It's why early on back in March, we basically really opened up so that developers could within a certain timeframe after notification for many purposes, not all purposes could -- once they notify begin marketing their test in the U.S. while we do our review. Because there are so many we have had to determine a triage process and that triage process does move high priority tests ahead of others because either they require an EUA to be marketed for their intended use or they are going to have a bigger impact on public health. All the while for those that are allowed to notify, they can market. We do -- we attempt to do a really quick check on all submission, EUA submissions to make sure there are no issues of public health concern and if they are, we tend to try to deal with those as quickly as possible obviously.
