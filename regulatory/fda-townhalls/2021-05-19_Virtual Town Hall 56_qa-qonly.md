#### 1. FDA Virtual Town Hall: SARS-CoV-2 Testing Updates and Questions

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can a software change in a fully automated molecular SARS-CoV-2 assay, which speeds up processing time by allowing steps to run simultaneously instead of sequentially, be made without needing EUA amendments if there are no changes to the assay design or reagents?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: If the software change impacts test parameters (e.g., temperature, dwell times, ramp rates, or extraction speeds) or introduces new claims, hardware, or instructions, an EUA amendment is needed. If performance is unaffected and these changes are not introduced, the change can be made without amendment.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can a software change in a fully automated molecular SARS-CoV-2 assay, which speeds up processing time by allowing steps to run simultaneously instead of sequentially, be made without needing EUA amendments if there are no changes to the assay design or reagents?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So, that will depend a little bit on the changes that are made if parameters to the test which is the temperature, dwell times, ramp rates, or the extractions speeds are changed. Then we would expect performance to be impacted. And in that case, we would expect a supplement to an EUA request. If your proposed change did not impact the performance of the device or change to the claims in the intended use or introduced substantially new information such as the addition of new hardware to support the software change, or any additional steps the user needs to take into the instructions for use or any of the authorized labeling. Then the change could be made without further amendment. An example to that would be if the reaction steps used the same parameters on a per-sample basis. Then there would be little risk that performance would be impacted.

#### 3. CLIA Waivers for EUA Tests and New Instruments

QA Block 3-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can the deemed as waived approach during an EUA be applied to a new assay on a new instrument that FDA has not previously reviewed?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The deemed as waived approach can be applied to new assays on new instruments not previously reviewed by FDA during an EUA, but applies only during the Public Health Emergency. Post-emergency use will require 510k clearance and CLIA waiver.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can the deemed as waived approach during an EUA be applied to a new assay on a new instrument that FDA has not previously reviewed?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So, I can clarify that we have, and we will when appropriate authorize tests under an EUA for use at the point of care. Even in situations when the instrument is new and has not been previously reviewed by FDA. Tests that we authorize for use at the point of care under EUA are considered to be deemed “waived” for purposes of the Emergency Use. So, what that means is that in the EUA Letter of Authorization, we indicate the specific authorized setting and for point of care tests we indicate that they can be used in settings that are operating under a CLIA Certificate of Waiver. They, those tests are not officially categorized as “waived” because they are only authorized for use during the Public Health Emergency. And after the emergency is over, the assay and the instrument will only be able to continue to be used in the same setting after obtaining 510k clearance and CLIA waiver.

#### 4. Analytical Study Requirements for 510k SARS-CoV-2 Test Submissions

QA Block 4-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What analytical studies are required to support a 510k submission for molecular SARS-CoV-2 tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA requires analytical studies to use naturally occurring clinical matrix unless unavailable. For selective studies excluding specimen stability and LOD, synthetic matrices may be used if their performance parallels that of natural specimens. Simulated matrices must mimic clinical specimens and undergo equivalence tests. A pre-submission is recommended to confirm validation approaches.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What analytical studies are required to support a 510k submission for molecular SARS-CoV-2 tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Generally we do require that analytical studies be performed with naturally occurring clinical matrix. In circumstances where naturally occurring clinical matrix is not available or is difficult to obtain, a synthetic matrix may be used for selective studies other than specimen stability and LOD. Provided that the performance observed with such a matrix is similar to that observed with naturally occurring specimens. So, when designing a simulated matrix, we recommend that each component of the matrix should simulate a component of a true clinical specimen. For example, in the formulation of a simulated throat swab matrix, you should consider using a cell phone use such as a pig gastric mucin. Because they predominate in the pharynx and are known to aide in bacterial preservation. Your simulated matrix should not contain components that do not mimic properties of a clinical matrix, especially if they are commonly used for aiding in analytic extraction or preservation. As appropriate, you should also consider each of the specimen collection and transport devices with which you wish to claim compatibility of your device and provide data to support their use. A simulated matrix equivalence study should be performed to compare the assay performance in synthetic and naturally occurring matrix. And that testing should be performed in parallel at the same target levels in both simulated and naturally occurring matrixes. In order to demonstrate equivalency, you should observe the expected proportion of positive results at each target level in both sample types. And as we've previously suggested in these Town Halls, we do recommend that if you intend to pursue a 510k, that you submit a pre-submission to discuss your validation approach.

QA Block 4-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What criteria need to be met when designing a synthetic clinical matrix for analytical studies?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: A synthetic clinical matrix can be used if obtaining a natural matrix is not feasible, but it must mimic true clinical specimens and produce comparable performance. Components should resemble real clinical materials (e.g., pig gastric mucin for throat swabs). It must exclude substances that do not mimic clinical properties and ensure compatibility with collection and transport devices. Equivalency studies should show consistent performance between simulated and natural matrices.

#### 10. EUA Submissions: Manufacturer or Distributor Responsibility?

QA Block 10-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Who can sponsor an EUA with regard to industry sponsors?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA allows both product manufacturers and distributors to sponsor an EUA, but distributors submitting EUAs must take full regulatory responsibility. FDA prefers a single submission per test to avoid multiple data sets being submitted.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Who can sponsor an EUA with regard to industry sponsors?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. We've authorized tests that, I think have been submitted by distributors, US distributors, and that is completely legitimate. We would prefer that your test developer doesn't have multiple US distributors submit applications to the FDA. That just makes our job harder because it doesn't really make sense for a single assay to be submitted in the US to have more than one set of validation data submitted. So, but, you know, that's also allowed, I'm just recommending that, that if the test developer wants to launch in the United States and work with a number of distribution partners. That they work that out and perform one submission, that would be ideal. Toby, anything to add? Yes. I would, yes, I totally agree with that, with that approach, and just want to clarify that whoever does submit the EUA request is taking regulatory responsibility for that test. So, if the distributor is submitting the EUA request, that distributor would become responsible, you know, sort of quote un- quote as the test developer, as the manufacturer, for all aspects of the test from a regulatory perspective. Which is absolutely acceptable from, from FDA's perspective. It just is important to, to be aware of, as the sponsor of an EUA and, you know, as Tim said we definitely prefer when a single submission is submitted for a test. And, you know, whoever it is that is submitting it manages the relationship with distributors rather than multiple EUA requests being submitted for the same test.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA allows distributors to sponsor an EUA, but prefers a single submission coordinated by the test developer to avoid complications with multiple submissions.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA expect only the product manufacturer to sponsor the EUA?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. We've authorized tests that, I think have been submitted by distributors, US distributors, and that is completely legitimate. We would prefer that your test developer doesn't have multiple US distributors submit applications to the FDA. That just makes our job harder because it doesn't really make sense for a single assay to be submitted in the US to have more than one set of validation data submitted. So, but, you know, that's also allowed, I'm just recommending that, that if the test developer wants to launch in the United States and work with a number of distribution partners. That they work that out and perform one submission, that would be ideal.

I would, yes, I totally agree with that, with that approach, and just want to clarify that whoever does submit the EUA request is taking regulatory responsibility for that test. So, if the distributor is submitting the EUA request, that distributor would become responsible, you know, sort of quote un- quote as the test developer, as the manufacturer, for all aspects of the test from a regulatory perspective. Which is absolutely acceptable from, from FDA's perspective. It just is important to, to be aware of, as the sponsor of an EUA and, you know, as Tim said we definitely prefer when a single submission is submitted for a test. And, you know, whoever it is that is submitting it manages the relationship with distributors rather than multiple EUA requests being submitted for the same test.

#### 12. Understanding FDA Reference Panels and NDU Measurements

QA Block 12-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How does the FDA define NDU per ml in the reference panel?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA defines NDU per ml as a subjective measure based on tests used for assessing the reference panel, combining multiple molecular assay targets within the viral genome. It is an artificial construct and not meant to replace or compare directly to LOD assessments.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How does the FDA define NDU per ml in the reference panel?
VERBATIM ANSWER: NDUs are, have to do with a subjective number based on the test that we use to assess the panel at the FDA. It is an average of a number of different molecular assays. So, it is not just, it's not an average, it's a compilation of multiple different targets within the genome of the virus. In order to get, you know, a very reliable nucleic acid detection assay result. So, it is, it is in some ways an artificial construct that shouldn't be compared directly to a typical LOD assessment and isn't intended for that purpose.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does a COVID-19 collection device require 510k clearance post EUA if used by a single laboratory with a laboratory-developed test, non-prescription, direct-to-consumer, and self-collection?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Yes, a COVID-19 home collection device requires 510k clearance post EUA and is not considered a laboratory-developed test (LDT). Authorization is necessary for direct-to-consumer, non-prescription self-collection kits, as their direct-to-consumer nature removes them from the LDT designation. FDA submission and authorization are critical for such devices.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does a COVID-19 collection device require 510k clearance post EUA if used by a single laboratory with a laboratory-developed test, non-prescription, direct-to-consumer, and self-collection?

And accordingly, laboratory developed tests are under, my understanding, from my CMS colleagues is that they do require an order by a physician. Yes. This sounds more direct to consumer than even OTC only because it's not selling a device over the counter and handing a test device over the counter. Which at least in the terminology for the pandemic, it's only test kits that are sold over the counter as over the counter and collection kits is direct to consumers. And yes, Toby is correct, that, well, anything direct to consumer is not considered an LDT and then also, anything that is collected at the home does need specific authorization. However, I thought I heard and correct us if you're wanting to know about 510k pathways to add and seek authorization for a home collection kit, is that correct? In order to convert to a full authorization on any, any test, and including a home collection test with a home collection kit. Would, you know if it's molecular at this point would be a 510k because there's already been one Denovo that's molecular. And yes, we consider all home collection kits are not considered LDT's. And so, whether they're for the pandemic or for some other purpose submission to the FDA is important. The direct-to-consumer aspect of this takes it out of the realm of an LDT.

VERBATIM ANSWER: We've certainly authorized home collection from multi-analyte. I'm not remembering, hopefully Toby knows better than me. If we've authorized an OTC home collection, multi-analyte kit. Toby, do you remember? Excuse me. I don't believe we've authorized a non-prescription, multi-analyte test at this point. Generally, there are no recommendations to test asymptomatic individuals for flu which is one of the reasons why we've kept that to prescriptions. So, you know, I think that's the best justification for not going the OTC route or the serial testing route, other than directed towards SARS-CoV-2. But certainly, symptomatic panel tests that expand access for SARS testing and reduce the need for performing multiple tests on individuals. As long as it does truly expand access, that would be home collection, Rx home collection, point of care. And high volume, extremely high-volume central lab tests are still open. If someone is symptomatic, yes, it could be something else, typically is these days, and but, OTC has essentially no controls other than labeling on what the test is used for. So, right now, we're sticking to Rx.

#### 16. FDA Requirements for Antigen Test Specificity and Throughput

QA Block 16-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are there any specific FDA requirements for the NPA or specificity for moderate to high complexity laboratory antigen tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA requires at least 80% NPA for antigen tests and generally prefers specificity not to fall below 98%, though this may be assessed case-by-case. High complexity tests are prioritized if they are high volume and typically automated.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are there any specific FDA requirements for the NPA or specificity for moderate to high complexity laboratory antigen tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, 80% at least for antigen tests, whether it's a central lab moderately complex or point of care or home. Specificity, we expect to be relative high, especially as the rates of infection go down. We don't want to have there to be too many false positives relative to the true positives. It would kind of defeat the purpose of the testing and, you know, have a lot of follow-up testing. It's just really confusing. Typically, we prefer not to see specificity any lower than say NPA lower than 98% but we do assess this on a case-by-case basis. The other thing is, antigen tests for the moderate and high complexity environment, we are prioritizing high volume tests typically on automated instruments. This woman is wanting to take the lateral flow test and submit it for moderate or high complexity testing environment that's not a current priority.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the validation requirements to make immune protection claims for a vaccinated population?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends conducting studies in collaboration with an EUA-authorized vaccine developer. Data on exact exposure timelines, antibody levels, and their ability to protect against infection are key. However, comprehensive validation requirements remain complex due to limited data linking antibody levels and immunity.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the validation requirements to make immune protection claims for a vaccinated population?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So, I mean, from a scientific perspective the best way to do these studies is in correlation with a vaccine developer and maybe preferably with a vaccine developer that has an EUA-authorized vaccine and who is treating in the US. And the reason why that could be potentially a very good study design is we know exactly when the patient, if they were antibody negative, prior to entry into the study. We know exactly when they got exposed when they received the vaccine, and they have good timelines. You can look at antibody levels and you're also looking at the ability of those antibodies and those antibody levels to protect an individual from symptomatic and/or asymptomatic infection. So, you know, that's the kind of outcomes study that we believe will show a correlation with protection and herd immunity. It's really hard to do it another way. Neutralizing antibody is only a surrogate for sort of immunities and certainly and the other thing, that's only in the B cell compartment. It doesn't have anything to do with the T cell compartment. So, you know, this is a complex area, and we haven't yet seen data at the FDA that allows us to assess what is an appropriate level of antibody and what it means. So, it's somewhat a little bit complicated to, I mean, we could probably say that certain designs of studies that aren't good. But it's a little bit hard to say what is needed, right, and to sign off on something that has never been shown or proven before. So, however, we believe that antibody tests are very useful today and certainly the development of antibodies after vaccination, if properly assessed, using the right tests for the vaccine.

So, it's somewhat a little bit complicated to, I mean, we could probably say that certain designs of studies that aren't good. But it's a little bit hard to say what is needed, right, and to sign off on something that has never been shown or proven before. So, however, we believe that antibody tests are very useful today and certainly the development of antibodies after vaccination, if properly assessed, using the right tests for the vaccine. I would urge everybody to read that communication that came out today. You know you can see whether antibodies were generated and it's just, you know difficult to know what that means at the present moment.

#### 19. FDA Guidance on OTC Antigen Test Authorization

QA Block 19-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the required number of asymptomatic individuals needed for FDA approval of an antigen test for at-home use?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: For FDA approval of an at-home antigen test, developers do not need to test asymptomatic individuals pre-market if performance criteria are met with 30 positives. For single-use authorization without serial testing, a minimum of 10 asymptomatic positives is required.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the required number of asymptomatic individuals needed for FDA approval of an antigen test for at-home use?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. So, we have, you know, a fairly recent, a new amendment, for home tests that whereby, you know, prior to authorization developers don't have to test a single asymptomatic individual. They simply determine the performance in asymptomatic population with 30 positives. And if performance meets the amendments, you know, recommended levels then we can authorize that test for OTC. As long as all the other OTC recommendations other than testing asymptomatics are conducted and are acceptable. We can authorize that as an OTC test for screening if the developer agrees to a serial testing plan. So, that for managing tests, it would be two to three times a week and for a molecular test, that would be once a week. So, I would urge you to check that, that recent amendment as you may find that helpful to get to the market as soon as possible. It's designed for that purpose. If a developer wants to take such a test as you have and wants to accumulate enough pre-marketing, asymptomatic patients. That they can and we would ask for a minimum of 10 asymptomatic positives that says the comparative test is positive on 10 asymptomatic's. And we can go ahead and authorized for single test use if performance is good enough and not require serial testing, not have to follow the serial testing plan.

Developers use 30 positives from the asymptomatic population to determine performance. Post-EUA, confirmation of performance in asymptomatic screening is required. Enrichment strategies are allowed under FDA oversight to address decreasing positive cases.

As the number of positives do decrease, unfortunately it's still quite a few in the United States. But as it does decrease and continues to decrease hopefully, we are allowing enrichment strategies. You know this is not having to test every single person in the study in order to find the positive.

That just makes our job harder because it doesn't really make sense for a single assay to be submitted in the US to have more than one set of validation data submitted. So, but, you know, that's also allowed, I'm just recommending that, that if the test developer wants to launch in the United States and work with a number of distribution partners. That they work that out and perform one submission, that would be ideal.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What regulatory responsibilities does the FDA assign to a distributor who submits an EUA request on behalf of a test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA assigns full regulatory responsibility to a distributor submitting an EUA request, treating the distributor as the test developer or manufacturer.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What regulatory responsibilities does the FDA assign to a distributor who submits an EUA request on behalf of a test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Whoever does submit the EUA request is taking regulatory responsibility for that test. So, if the distributor is submitting the EUA request, that distributor would become responsible, you know, sort of quote un- quote as the test developer, as the manufacturer, for all aspects of the test from a regulatory perspective. Which is absolutely acceptable from, from FDA's perspective.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Has the FDA previously authorized an over-the-counter home collection multi-analyte test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA has not authorized a non-prescription (over-the-counter) multi-analyte test at this time, due in part to the lack of recommendations for testing asymptomatic individuals for flu.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Has the FDA previously authorized an over-the-counter home collection multi-analyte test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Excuse me. I don't believe we've authorized a non-prescription, multi-analyte test at this point. Generally, there are no recommendations to test asymptomatic individuals for flu which is one of the reasons why we've kept that to prescriptions.

REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 15-7
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Under what conditions might the FDA consider authorizing over-the-counter multi-analyte tests in the future?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA currently focuses on prescription use for multi-analyte tests due to lack of controls for over-the-counter use, except for SARS-CoV-2-focused tests that truly expand access. OTC tests could be considered if they ensure appropriate use.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Under what conditions might the FDA consider authorizing over-the-counter multi-analyte tests in the future?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So, you know, I think that's the best justification for not going the OTC route or the serial testing route, other than directed towards SARS-CoV-2. But certainly, symptomatic panel tests that expand access for SARS testing and reduce the need for performing multiple tests on individuals. As long as it does truly expand access, that would be home collection, Rx home collection, point of care. And high volume, extremely high-volume central lab tests are still open. If someone is symptomatic, yes, it could be something else, typically is these days, and but, OTC has essentially no controls other than labeling on what the test is used for. So, right now, we're sticking to Rx.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is considered a high throughput test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA considers high throughput tests to typically involve fully automated systems. Detailed throughput and process information can be submitted via a pre-EUA to determine if thresholds are met.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is considered a high throughput test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So, as with all things in the pandemic, this does remain somewhat flexible depending on the current public health needs. You know we are typically looking at full automatic systems for the kind of volumes that we're talking about. But and we always recommend that if you need to know if you would qualify for our current thresholds, submit a pre-EUA just with that question. You know and you can add other things to the pre-EUA, but we need to know enough details about your method and the throughput and the steps that it would be able to assess whether it meets our thresholds for priority.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What does the FDA consider a preferred specificity threshold for antigen tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA prefers specificity for antigen tests to not be lower than 98%, but assesses this on a case-by-case basis.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What does the FDA consider a preferred specificity threshold for antigen tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, 80% at least for antigen tests, whether it's a central lab moderately complex or point of care or home. Specificity, we expect to be relative high, especially as the rates of infection go down. We don't want to have there to be too many false positives relative to the true positives. It would kind of defeat the purpose of the testing and, you know, have a lot of follow-up testing. It's just really confusing. Typically, we prefer not to see specificity any lower than say NPA lower than 98% but we do assess this on a case-by-case basis.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the required sample size for conducting clinical studies to validate claims for immune protection in a vaccinated population?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends conducting these studies in collaboration with an EUA-authorized vaccine developer to leverage detailed information on vaccination timelines and antibody responses. However, the FDA has not yet determined an appropriate antibody level or study design for proving immune protection.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the required sample size for conducting clinical studies to validate claims for immune protection in a vaccinated population?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So, I mean, from a scientific perspective the best way to do these studies is in correlation with a vaccine developer and maybe preferably with a vaccine developer that has an EUA-authorized vaccine and who is treating in the US. And the reason why that could be potentially a very good study design is we know exactly when the patient, if they were antibody negative, prior to entry into the study. We know exactly when they got exposed when they received the vaccine, and they have good timelines. You can look at antibody levels and you're also looking at the ability of those antibodies and those antibody levels to protect an individual from symptomatic and/or asymptomatic infection. So, you know, that's the kind of outcomes study that we believe will show a correlation with protection and herd immunity. It's really hard to do it another way. Neutralizing antibody is only a surrogate for sort of immunities and certainly and the other thing, that's only in the B cell compartment. It doesn't have anything to do with the T cell compartment. So, you know, this is a complex area, and we haven't yet seen data at the FDA that allows us to assess what is an appropriate level of antibody and what it means. So, it's somewhat a little bit complicated to, I mean, we could probably say that certain designs of studies that aren't good. But it's a little bit hard to say what is needed, right, and to sign off on something that has never been shown or proven before. So, however, we believe that antibody tests are very useful today and certainly the development of antibodies after vaccination, if properly assessed, using the right tests for the vaccine.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: The supplemental EUA template includes a specific approach for antigen tests, addressing asymptomatic testing requirements.
VERBATIM QUESTION: For antigen tests, does the supplemental EUA template include specific exemptions or amendments for asymptomatic testing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: And just to clarify it because I think you mentioned that you have antigen test. The supplemental EUA template is what Tim is referring to. There's also an EUA amendment for molecular tests that has a similar approach but for your situation, the supplemental EUA template would lay out the approach for your situation.
