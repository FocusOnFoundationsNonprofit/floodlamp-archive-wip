QA Block 6-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the FDA's thought process and policy on changes to EUAs?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA advises including flexibility in EUA submissions to authorize tests with various components. Future component changes should be submitted as supplemental EUA requests. Authorization letters specify conditions for such updates, and FAQs provide guidance on alternative testing supplies. Specific changes, like new specimen types, will also require supplemental EUA requests.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the FDA's thought process and policy on changes to EUAs?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Sure. So you're, you know, the best bet is always to include as much flexibility as you can in your authorization or in your test that you are submitting for authorization so that, you know, if possible we can authorize it with a variety of components. If you want to add additional components later on that's something that you would submit in a supplemental EUA request. When you - do you get authorized - your letter of authorization will include conditions of authorization that spell out what types of changes should come in for a supplemental EUA request in order to update the authorization. And a lot of the tests that are already authorized, you know, have those kind of - they all have those conditions. So you can see those on our Web site if you wanted to take a look at what - how those conditions are drafted. And I can also note that we do have some information on our FAQ page about alternate testing supplies. So for example we - we talk about the different types of swab types that can be used, most test now those that are being authorized - are being authorized for use with all of those, you know, NP swabs OP, mid turbinate and anterior nares. So we do talk about that. If you wanted to add a new specimen type all together like adding saliva that would be something you would come back in with. And these questions - or my responses rather all presuming that you're talking about a distributed test kit. So those are all the different considerations that you would want to look at as, you know, what you want to be able to include in your original instructions for use and what you might want to add later.

QA Block 6-11
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What considerations should be included in the original instructions for use to minimize future updates?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA advises including as much flexibility as possible in the original EUA submission, such as multiple swab types or components, to minimize needed future updates. Any additions post-authorization, like new specimen types, would require a supplemental EUA request. Existing FAQs and authorized test examples can guide developers.
VERBATIM QUESTION: IMPLICIT
VERBATIM ANSWER: Sure. So you're, you know, the best bet is always to include as much flexibility as you can in your authorization or in your test that you are submitting for authorization so that, you know, if possible we can authorize it with a variety of components. If you want to add additional components later on that's something that you would submit in a supplemental EUA request. When you - do you get authorized - your letter of authorization will include conditions of authorization that spell out what types of changes should come in for a supplemental EUA request in order to update the authorization. And a lot of the tests that are already authorized, you know, have those kind of - they all have those conditions. So you can see those on our Web site if you wanted to take a look at what - how those conditions are drafted.

So for example we - we talk about the different types of swab types that can be used, most test now those that are being authorized - are being authorized for use with all of those, you know, NP swabs OP, mid turbinate and anterior nares. So we do talk about that. If you wanted to add a new specimen type all together like adding saliva that would be something you would come back in with. And these questions - or my responses rather all presuming that you're talking about a distributed test kit. So those are all the different considerations that you would want to look at as, you know, what you want to be able to include in your original instructions for use and what you might want to add later.

#### 7. Clarifying the Term Screening in Medical Testing

QA Block 7-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can you clarify what is meant by the term 'screening'?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Screening refers to testing asymptomatic individuals to identify those who are infected but show no symptoms, aiming to detect infections at the individual level. This includes those who may not yet have developed symptoms or remain asymptomatic.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can you clarify what is meant by the term 'screening'?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Sure so when we refer to screening - and we do have information on this up on our Web site on the FAQ page. We have a question that discusses the difference between surveillance, screening and diagnostic testing. So when we talk about screening we're talking about testing primarily asymptomatic individuals to look for occurrence at the individual level. So this would be, you know, a broad testing of asymptomatic individuals who do not have any known exposure with the intent of identifying individuals who were infected but don't have any symptoms either because they have not yet developed them or because we know that with this disease there are a number of individuals who are infected but do not present with any symptoms.

NCI evaluations are integral before authorization, especially for lateral flow and other technologies. Details on NCI evaluation are available on the FDA website.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are there any updates on the NCI testing backlog and how it has delayed EUA authorizations?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Thanks for that question, so try to answer it a little bit and then I'll see if Brittany wants to add anything there. So we do prioritize the tests that are being tested at NCI based on a number of factors including the data that we are already aware of before they perform that testing. And we do find that we get very useful information from the NCI testing so right now we are tending to rely on that. But I'll turn it over to Brittany to see if she wants to add anything there about the backlog or the prioritization? Yes obviously we are reviewing all EUA requests as quickly as we can. And as Toby mentioned we - and Tim has mentioned previously - we are prioritizing reviews based on several factors, and we are also prioritizing testing at NCI. And priority for testing at NCI is being given to tests with complete submissions. So we have complete validation data in the EUA request and where the performance is adequate based on the data submitted in EUA request. And we are continuing through that process. There is a Frequently Asked Question on our Web site regarding how we're incorporating the results from the NCI's evaluation into our decision-making for EUA requests. It highlights there some of the concerns we've had in particular for lateral flow devices. And for those reasons we generally have the NCI evaluation prior to any authorization particularly for lateral flow devices, and for other technologies as well like the ELISA, chemiluminescence immunoassays, et cetera.

#### 17. Guidance on Documenting Changes to Authorized EUA Devices

QA Block 17-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can changes to software components of an authorized product, which would normally be documented internally under the 510k paradigm, also follow an internal documentation pathway instead of submitting an EUA amendment?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Whether software changes can follow internal documentation versus an EUA amendment depends on how the product is specified in its authorization. Some changes, such as specific named components or critical reagents, may require formal review, whereas broader specifications might not. Decisions should involve consultation with FDA reviewers.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can changes to software components of an authorized product, which would normally be documented internally under the 510k paradigm, also follow an internal documentation pathway instead of submitting an EUA amendment?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So I'm going to turn this over to Kris in a moment but I think some of this depends on how the components of your test are specified in your authorization. So, you know, buffers are something that might need to be looked at specifically by the team to take a look at that. But if, you know, if you're for example if your test was authorized for use with a specific manufactured swab and you wanted to switch to a different one the fact that it was named in your authorization would mean that, you know, technically you should get that change authorized. If on the other hand the - your EUA was authorized for use with, you know, sort of more broadly with nasal swabs then that would be something that you would not need to come in for that change. So it depends. And, you know, that was sort of a - almost a silly example but you can sort of use that to understand how that might apply to other components. Yes thank you. I would just like to echo Toby's point. You know, it's somewhat governed by the extent to which your labeling specifies those reagents. And I know we've seen some small changes to extraction buffers perhaps removing, you know, certain components due to shortages. And I think that really needs to be taken a look at by a subject matter expert rather than just kind of providing a blanket policy because certainly, you know, small changes in pH or what the composition of buffer is versus taking away carrier RNA for instance, I mean those are two very different changes that may need to have considerations by someone who's on the review team.

VERBATIM ANSWER: So I'm going to turn this over to Kris in a moment but I think some of this depends on how the components of your test are specified in your authorization. So, you know, buffers are something that might need to be looked at specifically by the team to take a look at that. But if, you know, if you're for example if your test was authorized for use with a specific manufactured swab and you wanted to switch to a different one the fact that it was named in your authorization would mean that, you know, technically you should get that change authorized. If on the other hand the - your EUA was authorized for use with, you know, sort of more broadly with nasal swabs then that would be something that you would not need to come in for that change. So it depends. And, you know, that was sort of a - almost a silly example but you can sort of use that to understand how that might apply to other components.

QA Block 17-7
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How should labeling specificity for reagents guide decisions on whether a change needs regulatory review?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Labeling specificity of reagents plays a critical role in determining the need for regulatory review. Small changes, like modifying buffer components, should be reviewed by experts, as the impact can vary based on the nature of the change.
VERBATIM QUESTION: IMPLICIT
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes thank you. I would just like to echo Toby's point. You know, it's somewhat governed by the extent to which your labeling specifies those reagents. And I know we've seen some small changes to extraction buffers perhaps removing, you know, certain components due to shortages. And I think that really needs to be taken a look at by a subject matter expert rather than just kind of providing a blanket policy because certainly, you know, small changes in pH or what the composition of buffer is versus taking away carrier RNA for instance, I mean those are two very different changes that may need to have considerations by someone who's on the review team.

#### Section 17 of 19
##### Explicit Questions Extraction
QE 17-1: Can changes to software components of an authorized product, which would normally be documented internally under the 510k paradigm, also follow an internal documentation pathway instead of submitting an EUA amendment?
QE 17-2: If a test authorized with specific manufactured swabs switches to a different one, does that require getting the change authorized since the original swab was named in the authorization?
QE 17-3: If a test was authorized for use broadly with nasal swabs, would switching to a different swab not require coming in for a change authorization?
QE 17-4: If there's a small change to a buffer in an extraction kit, but the mechanism by which it works remains the same, and under the 510k pathway this would clearly be an internal documentation change, does this require EUA review?

##### Implicit Questions Extraction
QI 17-1: What criteria determine whether a change to a component of an authorized diagnostic test needs to be submitted for review or can be handled internally?
QI 17-2: If an extraction kit has a change in buffer composition due to shortages but the mechanism remains unchanged, does that require submission for an EUA amendment?
QI 17-3: How should labeling specificity for reagents guide decisions on whether a change needs regulatory review?
