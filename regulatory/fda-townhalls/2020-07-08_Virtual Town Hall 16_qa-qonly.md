#### 1. Updates on COVID-19 Testing and Device Authorization

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the process for seeking FDA feedback on saliva collection devices during the emergency?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends contacting them through the templates email address to discuss whether saliva collection devices may be appropriate. Additionally, the EUA template for home collection offers guidance on requirements such as stability and usability data.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the process for seeking FDA feedback on saliva collection devices during the emergency?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We've had some recent inquiries so I want to share that we are welcoming certain immediate requests for collection devices that would otherwise need a 510k such as saliva collection devices. If you're interested in this please approach us through the templates email address and we can discuss if your device may be appropriate for that approach. We see this approach as being helpful to developers that want to use these devices and eliminate some of the validations that might otherwise be required for each individual assay. And we're also looking at other ways to ease the path to market for other devices during the emergency. So for collection device manufacturers who are interested in pursuing this we suggest that you take a look at the EUA template for home collection. It may not be a perfect fit but that template does include a lot of information that we would want to see for standalone collection devices such as stability and usability data. So as we continue to work through this, we'll continue to provide additional information regarding the process.

#### 2. Clarifying Asymptomatic Testing Under Standing Physician Orders

QA Block 2-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does our test still need to have a claim for testing of asymptomatic individuals if our testing will be done under physician orders as part of our screening program?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Tests do not need to claim performance for asymptomatic individuals when testing under physician orders with standing orders allowed. Physicians can request such testing, but labs must avoid claiming validated performance unless appropriate validation is completed.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does our test still need to have a claim for testing of asymptomatic individuals if our testing will be done under physician orders as part of our screening program?
VERBATIM ANSWER: To answer your question on the standing order all authorizations are at the moment still prescription only, standing orders by physicians can be made. And yes that physician or that clinician can make that order can say that they would like asymptomatic individuals to be tested. And then the lab it comes to we're asking that they go ahead and test those samples and report out those results. And as long as the lab isn't making the claim that they have a certain performance on asymptomatic patients then that's all good. If a lab wants a specific claim then we'll work with them. And our templates have the recommended validation for a lab or a kit manufacturer that wants to make a claim for an asymptomatic claim for their test. So the short answer is on them - answer your questions are standing orders were fine and yes then they can order that asymptomatic testing. And then our pathways, you may not know this, but it allows labs like yourself to validate their tests notifying us and then they have - and then you have - 15 business days to submit their EUA occupation. And all the while they start testing and continue testing while we review the application.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Lily Wong
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: asymptomatic testing, physician standing orders, EUA validation
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 2-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: If the lab is not going to make an asymptomatic claim and we have a standing order from a physician to test the asymptomatic population, would we then not need to perform the validation testing specified in the June 16 updated template?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA confirms that if the lab does not make an asymptomatic claim and has a physician's standing order, it does not need to complete the validation testing outlined in the June 16 template. Physicians can order tests for anyone suspected of COVID-19, including asymptomatic individuals in high-risk situations.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If the lab is not going to make an asymptomatic claim and we have a standing order from a physician to test the asymptomatic population, would we then not need to perform the validation testing specified in the June 16 updated template?
VERBATIM ANSWER: That is correct and the physician understands that you haven't validated I'm sure for that indication. But if they have the order, they can order the test on anybody that falls under that sort of suspected of COVID. And that could be asymptomatic in high-risk situations which going back to school in the fall might fall under that. So we have no issue with that and there's a clear description in the - in our FAQs on that.

#### 4. Eligibility and Pathways for Umbrella Serology Testing Program

QA Block 4-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Would a high throughput system for serology testing be a good candidate for the umbrella program?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The umbrella program focuses on tests that can be easily assessed at the NCI, which limits it primarily to lateral flow and ELISA kits. High throughput systems requiring large, non-standard equipment may face challenges. Such systems can follow the regular EUA pathway instead, starting with validation and notification.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Would a high throughput system for serology testing be a good candidate for the umbrella program?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes so the umbrella program - and but Toby you can correct me if I say incorrectly is designed for those tests that can go to the NCI, it's the current place where this program is being or these kits are being tested. The any test that can easily show up there. And we test it at the NCI. So anything that requires large equipment, non-standard equipment so that's why you see primarily at the moment for lateral flow and for ELISA be easily done in that environment. So anything else could be a little bit more of a challenge for us to do. And without that NCI testing result that we're asking everyone that falls under that do, you know, we have the alternate just regular pathway for review which, you know, just includes an EUA submission. NWX-FDA OC US You can notify once you validate and follow that guidance and then you can go ahead and market a new test while we - and then you're - you'll submit that EUA package within - by two weeks of notification and we start reviewing it at that time.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA evaluates whether a test suits the umbrella EUA pathway or individual EUA based on the specific situation of the test, though developers submit the same data for either pathway.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How does the FDA decide whether an individual EUA is more appropriate than inclusion in the umbrella EUA?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Regarding the umbrella EUA I just want to clarify that the umbrella EUA was issued, it was intended to be - to ease an administrative burden mostly on our side of things just to remind the administrative process of getting the authorizations out. As you'll see we haven't actually added any tests to the umbrella EUA. At this time we have issued all of the serology EUAs, as individual EUAs because they were more appropriate for the specific situation of the tests that have been authorized. NWX-FDA OC US So from the developer or the test perspective you'll submit all the same information to us and then we can work with you to determine whether it is appropriate to go through the umbrella pathway or the individual pathway.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the rationale behind the umbrella EUA easing administrative burdens but not currently including tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The umbrella EUA was issued to ease administrative burdens for processing authorizations but currently does not include any tests. Serology EUAs have been issued individually as this approach better suits the specific situations of the tests.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the rationale behind the umbrella EUA easing administrative burdens but not currently including tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Regarding the umbrella EUA I just want to clarify that the umbrella EUA was issued, it was intended to be - to ease an administrative burden mostly on our side of things just to remind the administrative process of getting the authorizations out. As you'll see we haven't actually added any tests to the umbrella EUA.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: How should temperature excursions in stability studies be adjusted for seasonal variations such as summer or winter conditions?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Temperature excursions should be based on expected seasonal profiles, such as summer or winter. For studies extending to 72 hours, only the longest condition in the ISTA standard needs to be expanded to the required duration.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How should temperature excursions in stability studies be adjusted for seasonal variations such as summer or winter conditions?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So I'll give you the scheme within the home shipping and stability standard is basically to do excursions based on whether or not you think it's going to be a summer or winter temperature. And so basically for the winter profiles thinking ahead, you know, where we're going to be. You know, it's held at minus 10 degree C for eight hours a goes up to 18 degree C for four hours, minus 10 for two hours 10 degree C for 36 minus ten for six hours. So this is described in the same document that's referenced, this ISTA standard. But in that when it says okay if you're going to go to 72 hours you don't need to NWX-FDA OC US expand each one of those conditions equally.

#### 7. Resolving Discrepancies Between PCR and Antibody Test Results

QA Block 7-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: If there's a discrepancy between the antibody test and a PCR test, is there a referee to resolve the discrepancy?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA acknowledges the difficulty in resolving discrepancies between antibody and PCR test results, mainly due to irregular antibody response patterns or potential false positives in serology tests.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If there's a discrepancy between the antibody test and a PCR test, is there a referee to resolve the discrepancy?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes that's a difficult one. So, you know, the discrepancy is that the antibody is not detect it. We know that not everybody or not every - most serology tests as I said don't detect IgG at 100% at any point necessarily. Some do at some point, a lot, you know, after say 15 days more and more tests are positive because the immune system has mounted its adaptive response and antibodies are being are circulating that you can test. If you're seeing false positives that's a situation where you have people who are screened with PCR but after, you know, SARS COV-2 has been circulating and NWX-FDA OC US they are PCR negative whenever they were tested but now they're antibody positive that hopefully that doesn't happen that often.

QA Block 7-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How would one justify and resolve discrepancies between the PCR positive samples and antibody test results, especially when there is a range from seven days to over 100 days?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends conducting studies with most samples taken between two weeks and two months after PCR positivity, as antibodies wane over time. Testing closer to PCR positivity ensures accurate negative population results.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How would one justify and resolve discrepancies between the PCR positive samples and antibody test results, especially when there is a range from seven days to over 100 days?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We do recommend that folks when they do studies you kind of try to get most of your samples between two weeks and two months after the PCR positive. That protects you both ways because antibodies can wane overtime and maybe if they're negative if you test them 100 days out because the antibody was there at one point but that now has gone away. And another thing is if you have a fairly close time period between PCR test and the history of no symptoms and then you do the testing for the negative population, you're more likely just to have truly negative patients.

REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 7-6
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How can developers minimize discrepancies between PCR results and antibody test results when conducting validation?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: To minimize discrepancies between PCR and antibody test results, developers should ensure PCR positivity for study subjects, account for days after symptoms onset, and validate using pre-COVID serum for specificity. Accurate temporal alignment between PCR tests and the antibody tests is also essential.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How can developers minimize discrepancies between PCR results and antibody test results when conducting validation?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Right so, you know, at this point, you know, the best truth for antibody test development is to know whether or not the person is PCR positive and then you know how many days after symptoms you're performing the validation and/or and also we would like to know how many days after the PCR. But having that PCR positivity for the patients enrolled in your study tells us yes, they did have SARS COV-2. And that is actually helpful to developers because you were to try to compare to another serology test and may not be gold standard and you might end up with a potential false positive because not all a lot of the serology tests don't have, you know, near 100% detection. So really for developers the serology tests these rapid antibody tests it's best to use PCR. And for your positive population that should work great for your negative population is somewhat ideal if you can get your hands on pre-COVID serum and plasma to do your study setting for specificity because you know that those folks weren't exposed.

VERBATIM ANSWER: And to provide some of that clarification, you know, so that you submitted a pre-EUA and then an EUA. It's unclear to me whether you've also notified. So if you want to clarify that the pre-EUA process is primarily for situations where you have not completed validation and you need some questions answered and want to have some dialogue about what appropriate validation would be. That maybe is beyond what's in the guidance and in the template. NWX-FDA OC US And then the notification is what we would expect when you have validated your test and plan to begin offering the test prior to an EUA. And so if you are currently offering your test you should have either a notification in place and be listed on our notification list on our Web site or have received an EUA authorization to be listed on our EUA page. So the - there is a difference between a notification and the EUA request. So the EUA request is what you submit when you are ready to move forward and present all of your validation data for our review. The acknowledgment letter that you get from submitting an EUA request is just an acknowledgment that we have your submission in-house. Once we have completed the review and have reached a decision then we will issue hopefully an authorization letter specifically for your test.

QA Block 13-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can an EUA-approved test be used on a different platform?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA states that high complexity CLIA certified labs may modify an EUA-approved test for use on a different platform by validating modifications through a bridging study, but tests validated this way will not receive an EUA.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can an EUA-approved test be used on a different platform?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. So if you take a look at the COVID-19 test policy guidance that we've issued there is a discussion for modifications made by high complexity CLIA certified laboratories that are modifying the EUA authorized test. And that's for, you know, just like you're talking about modifications to components such as the platform that it's being run on. And it talks about validating those modifications using our bridging study and that we would not accept an EUA for tests that are validated in that way.

QA Block 13-9
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the FDA accept EUAs for tests validated through modifications by non-CLIA labs?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA does not accept EUAs for tests validated through modifications by non-CLIA labs. These modifications, such as changing platforms, must follow FDA's bridging study protocols but will not be eligible for EUA.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA accept EUAs for tests validated through modifications by non-CLIA labs?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. So if you take a look at the COVID-19 test policy guidance that we've issued there is a discussion for modifications made by high complexity CLIA certified laboratories that are modifying the EUA authorized test.

QA Block 18-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is an EUA required for on-site self-collection if it's observed by a healthcare provider?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA confirms that on-site self-collection observed by a healthcare provider does not necessarily require an EUA, unlike home collection, which does.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is an EUA required for on-site self-collection if it's observed by a healthcare provider?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Sure. So we do consider those to be separate and distinct things. We have indicated that home collection requires and EUA. On-site health self-collection observed by a health provider does not necessarily require a separate authorization. We've indicated on our FAQs that both the mid turbinate and anterior nares specimens are appropriate for on-site collection.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Sarah Burlucky
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: EUA requirements, on-site self-collection, healthcare provider observation
