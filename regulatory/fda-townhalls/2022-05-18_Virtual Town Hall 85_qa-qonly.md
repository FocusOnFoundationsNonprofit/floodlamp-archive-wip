#### 4. FDA Guidelines for Multi-Analyte Test Validation Strategies

QA Block 4-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What clinical validation strategies would FDA recommend to support authorization of a multi-analyte test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends conducting a two-week prospective clinical study to evaluate performance if a test uses transport media. If sufficient positive specimens are not collected within two weeks, a clinical validation study with archived samples can be done. Archived positive samples are acceptable if no or insufficient positives are obtained; prospects for a post-authorization study may be required. For direct specimen tests, FDA advises discussing banked sample strategies before study initiation. Refer to FDA's templates for more details.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What clinical validation strategies would FDA recommend to support authorization of a multi-analyte test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So if your test has a claim for use with a transport media, then we would recommend evaluating the clinical performance with a prospective clinical study conducted for at least two weeks. And after the two‐week duration, if you have not collected the recommended number of positive specimens, then a clinical validation study using retrospective samples may be conducted at one of your testing sites. In that case, you should test archived positive and negative clinical samples. And we do know that the reduced prevalence of influenza last season may make archived specimens difficult to obtain, but we do still recommend testing archived samples to support authorization. We will accept 100% retrospective positive samples for flu if the two weeks of prospective testing results in none or less than the recommended number of positives. And then there would likely be a condition of authorization to complete a post‐authorization clinical study. And that can be discussed during the review of your EUA request. We generally would recommend that you refer to the template that's available on our website for additional information. And then if your test has a claim for use with a direct specimen‐‐ and this is for antigen or molecular, where the swab is placed directly into a proprietary buffer after specimen collection, instead of using a transport media‐‐ then we would recommend discussing potential use of banked samples with us prior to initiating your study, since there are some additional challenges in those cases.

TOPICS: Duration of prospective study, Transport media, Clinical validation
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 4-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What steps should be taken if the recommended number of positive samples is not collected during the two-week prospective study?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: If the recommended number of positive samples is not collected during the two-week prospective study, a retrospective study using archived positive and negative clinical samples can be conducted. Testing archived samples is recommended even if their availability is limited. FDA will accept 100% retrospective positive samples for flu if fewer than the required positives are collected prospectively, with a post-authorization study likely required.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What steps should be taken if the recommended number of positive samples is not collected during the two-week prospective study?
VERBATIM ANSWER: If you have not collected the recommended number of positive specimens, then a clinical validation study using retrospective samples may be conducted at one of your testing sites. In that case, you should test archived positive and negative clinical samples. And we do know that the reduced prevalence of influenza last season may make archived specimens difficult to obtain, but we do still recommend testing archived samples to support authorization.

QA Block 6-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the FDA's stance on using international locations for flu B sample collection for diagnostic test validation?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is open to using international locations where flu B is circulating for sample collection, particularly if using direct detection technologies. Flexibility will be displayed regarding the geographical locations for flu A/B prospective collection.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the FDA's stance on using international locations for flu B sample collection for diagnostic test validation?
VERBATIM ANSWER: I think if there are areas of the world where flu B is circulating, I think the FDA is going to be open to being able to go there, because there are some technologies, particularly direct detection technologies, that don't go into a VTM, which Toby mentioned earlier. And VTM for rapid antigen tests is problematic when it includes, at least for SARS, because we've seen so many challenges with VTM, and nearly all, if not all, of the antigen tests have moved away from the use of VTM. There are potential use of saline, but by and large, it is a direct swab. So getting banked direct swabs samples for evaluation of a flu A/B test is going to be challenging. And so prospective collection is still one option. So we're going to display some flexibility on where in the world you get the flu A/Bs.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: Direct detection technologies not using VTM, such as saline or direct swabs, are alternatives for flu A/B testing.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What alternative sample collection methods can be used for flu A/B testing if VTM is problematic?
VERBATIM ANSWER: There are some technologies, particularly direct detection technologies, that don't go into a VTM, which Toby mentioned earlier. And VTM for rapid antigen tests is problematic when it includes, at least for SARS, because we've seen so many challenges with VTM, and nearly all, if not all, of the antigen tests have moved away from the use of VTM. There are potential use of saline, but by and large, it is a direct swab.

#### 8. OTC Testing: Randomization and Regulatory Strategy Guidance

QA Block 8-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Why does the FDA recommend not randomizing in over-the-counter antigen testing studies?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA does not recommend randomization in OTC antigen testing studies to avoid training users on swab collection, as users at home lack such training. A sufficient washout period, such as 15 minutes, between self-swabbing and a comparator test ensures unbiased results.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Why does the FDA recommend not randomizing in over-the-counter antigen testing studies?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah, so the response to this can depend. But based on what you're telling me, the purpose for collecting the comparator results, which also potentially could be the test of record, but that's where it can be tricky sometimes with IRBs, but if you're doing a comparator test, the reason to take that second in all cases is we're trying not to train the user on how to collect a swab. So if they get administered a swab right before they take a swab of their own, that could provide them training that users out at home won't have that training. They won't have somebody swabbing their nose right before they do a self‐swab. So we want to look at an unbiased picture of the OTC users. So you can put in, say, a 15‐minute washout period. So some developers have had a participant perform the candidate device test. That usually takes‐‐ it could take 15 to 20 minutes, right? And then when they finish, you can have a health care worker swab their anterior nares, if that's the competitor swab, and then they're done. So if you just use the time of testing, that provides, we believe, a sufficient washout period between the first swabbing of the nose to the second swabbing of the nose. So it should not impact the comparator test result.

And I think I'd like to turn that over to Toby or to Kris to go ahead and respond. Toby, I don't know if you have anything, but I think that adding additional claims, and especially for asymptomatic folks, or screening claims or anything of that nature, I think, is something we probably want to interact with you in the context of your test.

#### 9. FDA Guidance on Home Test Result Reporting Mechanisms

QA Block 9-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the difference in the request for a manufacturer to provide a result reporting mechanism between EUA and full authorization for a home use antigen test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: For EUA, a reporting feature is not mandatory, but developers are encouraged to enable user result reporting, and there may be a post-market commitment for this. For full authorization, reporting mechanisms are assessed through Pre-Sub/Q-Sub discussions, and carrying over a developed reporting feature from EUA is anticipated.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the difference in the request for a manufacturer to provide a result reporting mechanism between EUA and full authorization for a home use antigen test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah. So yeah, let me go over what's recommended or encouraged for EUA. So for an EUA authorization, it is not a requirement for a decision to have a reporting feature. If you don't have a reporting feature that we view at the time of authorization, then we do have a post‐market commitment for the test developer to come up with a method for users to be able to report their results. Usually, reporting results in this situation is voluntary. And so the users have the option to opt out of reporting, or they can choose not to report. However, it is encouraged. And it is encouraged, obviously, for them to report results to their health care worker, even if it's an over‐the‐counter test. So we totally understand that consumers, especially if it's a manual entry versus an automated entry of results, that the consumers may or may not do that. So we can't hold the test developers responsible for results not being reported because it is a voluntary aspect by users. As far as recommendations for full authorization, I think that's best handled, again, through a Pre‐Sub/Q‐Sub. But we anticipate that those that get an EUA and then develop a reporting feature will carry that on through their full authorization submission.

#### 13. Challenges of Using Banked Samples in Diagnostic Testing

QA Block 13-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can banked VTM samples with verified buffers and no inhibitory effects be used for flu A/B OTC and rapid antigen tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Using banked VTM samples for flu A/B OTC and rapid antigen tests involves challenges, including dilution effects, workflow changes, and possible lot-specific performance issues. FDA recommends confirming buffer suitability with them first.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can banked VTM samples with verified buffers and no inhibitory effects be used for flu A/B OTC and rapid antigen tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So there's two challenges with that. Of course, you are highlighted one, that there's a dilution. And so your performance may be lower for both SARS‐CoV‐2 and flu A and B when you dilute the sample before going on your device. And there's challenges in getting home users to do that kind of testing because it changes the workflow for your assay. Plus, I would recommend that you check the buffer with the FDA first, because we really have seen widespread issues with VTM. And it appears to be, in some cases, lot specific. You might have some lots that perform just fine, and other lots that don't. And the actual root cause of those false positives with VTM is not yet well‐ understood enough to know how it could be prevented.

#### 14. FDA Recommendations for COVID Test Gene Targeting

QA Block 14-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the FDA's viewpoint on the recommendations for targeting genes in PCR COVID tests from different agencies, such as CDC and WHO?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends molecular assays target two or more genes in highly conserved regions, such as the e-Gene. Inclusion in silico analysis should ensure that selected primers and probes can address current and past variants. FDA does not mandate specific genes but allows incorporation of other agencies' recommendations for U.S. authorization.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the FDA's viewpoint on the recommendations for targeting genes in PCR COVID tests from different agencies, such as CDC and WHO?
VERBATIM ANSWER: For molecular assays, we do recommend two or more targets. And we also recommend highly conserved regions. So in general, the e‐Gene is going to be sufficient for those purposes. We do ask you do inclusion in silico analysis to make sure that the primers and probes you select will properly deal with the variants currently in circulation. We'd want to know, even for past variants, just to know how they might be affected, because it just kind of tests the robustness of your design. So it sounds like that, if there's other territories that have specific recommendations on how you do the testing, they can be incorporated into a molecular test for U.S. authorization.

#### 18. EUA Antigen Test Review Timeline and Prioritization Factors

QA Block 18-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: We applied for an EUA OTC antigen test this month and have a lead reviewer assigned. How does the timeline look for a response since the application is fully completed?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA reviews submissions in 10 days for completeness, and assignment of a reviewer typically indicates the file is complete. Review speed depends on the submission's quality, organization, and significance of issues. Increased resources are allocated to expedite antigen test reviews, but no precise timeline can be provided.
VERBATIM QUESTION: We applied for an EUA OTC antigen test this month and have a lead reviewer assigned. How does the timeline look for a response since the application is fully completed?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Well, not necessarily. So the priority has to do with its impact on the pandemic response now and on volume and on the quality of the submission. So many of the other countries do not do a review of a submission. And so certainly if there is additional information that is available for the FDA to review from work outside the U.S., that is helpful. So I think, as I've stated before, we have a 10‐day review deadline. So typically, if you haven't heard from us in 10 days, we do a completeness check within 10 days. So if that's within, if now you have past 10 days and you have been assigned a reviewer, that's usually a sign that the file was judged to be complete, or at least all the elements that we expect to see are there. Whether they are properly done and executed or not is perhaps to be determined. If you've been assigned a reviewer, that's also a good step. As I've noted recently, we are still seeing many, many, many EUAs, and a lot of them are antigen tests. And in fact, the bulk of the new submissions are in the antigen test area. So we have beefed up that team. We have shifted resources to make those reviews go faster. But we, unfortunately, cannot tell you how quick that is. And as we've said, if the submission is well‐organized and the studies are well‐written and well‐done, and there are no issues that are of significance, those applications do go through more quickly.

#### 19. Clarifying Sample Collection Order in Clinical Studies

QA Block 19-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: For clinical studies involving different sample sites, such as a nasopharyngeal sample for PCR versus an anterior nasal sample for an antigen test, can the PCR sample be taken first?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA generally prefers the comparator collection to occur after the molecular collection to avoid biases. However, specific cases, such as tests of record, may require a different order, in which case developers should consult the FDA for approval through a pre-EUA.
VERBATIM QUESTION: For clinical studies involving different sample sites, such as a nasopharyngeal sample for PCR versus an anterior nasal sample for an antigen test, can the PCR sample be taken first?
VERBATIM ANSWER: It does depend. If it can be done, we would prefer to see the molecular collection, the comparative collection done afterwards because there's both potential collection bias, in addition to other biases, such as interpretation bias. And we are looking for can somebody self‐collect on their own, without any sort of instructions or training or coaching. And even if they take a mid‐turbinate or a nasopharyngeal swab sample for comparator, they are seeing how the health care worker is handling a swab and doing the swabbing. So that is what's preferred. There are situations like tests of record where some developers may be required to test the record first. And so if you don't do it the preferred way, I would just recommend that you touch base with the FDA, probably through a pre‐EUA, to make sure that your plan is acceptable.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What concerns might IRBs have when using comparator tests as the test of record in over-the-counter studies?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: IRBs may find it tricky to use comparator tests as the test of record due to concerns about avoiding user training. Ensuring a washout period between swabs helps prevent bias caused by prior swab training, preserving an unbiased evaluation of over-the-counter users.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What concerns might IRBs have when using comparator tests as the test of record in over-the-counter studies?
VERBATIM ANSWER: OK. OK. Yeah, so the response to this can depend. But based on what you're telling me, the purpose for collecting the comparator results, which also potentially could be the test of record, but that's where it can be tricky sometimes with IRBs, but if you're doing a comparator test, the reason to take that second in all cases is we're trying not to train the user on how to collect a swab. So if they get administered a swab right before they take a swab of their own, that could provide them training that users out at home won't have that training. They won't have somebody swabbing their nose right before they do a self-swab. So we want to look at an unbiased picture of the OTC users. So you can put in, say, a 15-minute washout period. So some developers have had a participant perform the candidate device test. That usually takes—it could take 15 to 20 minutes, right? And then when they finish, you can have a health care worker swab their anterior nares, if that's the competitor swab, and then they're done. So if you just use the time of testing, that provides, we believe, a sufficient washout period between the first swabbing of the nose to the second swabbing of the nose. So it should not impact the comparator test result.

So it'd be better to understand where you are in your validation and all of those details. So I would suggest sending an email in, and so we can have a more detailed conversation about what exactly you all want to do.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Annie Wright
SPEAKER ANSWER: Kris Roth (FDA)
TOPICS: asymptomatic claims, screening claims, FDA guidance
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 8-13
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What type of interaction does the FDA recommend for discussing additional claims like asymptomatic or screening indications, and what details should test developers provide?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends interacting with them when seeking additional claims, such as for asymptomatic or screening indications. Test developers should provide details about their validation and the specifics of their test.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What type of interaction does the FDA recommend for discussing additional claims like asymptomatic or screening indications, and what details should test developers provide?

QA Block 8-14
CLARIFIED QUESTION: When should a developer use an email versus a pre-EUA submission to discuss study protocols in detail?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: An email is appropriate for short questions, but if the matter is more involved and includes study protocol review, a pre-EUA submission is recommended.
VERBATIM QUESTION: When should a developer use an email versus a pre-EUA submission to discuss study protocols in detail?
VERBATIM ANSWER: If it's a short question, then email is perfectly fine. And you can help us to understand kind of where you're at. If it's kind of more involved and we need to look at the study protocol, then a pre‐EUA is likely more appropriate.
