#### 1. Updates on FDA COVID-19 Test Submissions and Recommendations

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What steps are recommended to validate a test with the transport media identified in its intended use when changing the volume of collection medium?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends validating your test with the transport media from its intended use, specifying tested volume during LOD testing. For changing media or volume, perform a matrix equivalency study, spiking swabs with known concentrations and adjusting volumes accordingly. For tests with extraction steps, a clinical evaluation with larger volume samples can assess the worst-case scenario.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What steps are recommended to validate a test with the transport media identified in its intended use when changing the volume of collection medium?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We do recommend that you validate your test with the transport media identified in your intended use. Media is provided in a range of volumes and you should specify in your LOD testing what volume you tested and note that that's the average or expected fill volume in the VTM provided by the vendor. If you're trying to change the transport media or the volume for your test, we would recommend performing a matrix equivalency study to evaluate the LOD. And you can start with a swab spiked with known concentrations placed in different volumes of the same collection medium and follow the testing instructions for your test. That should take into account the dilution factor there. You can also, if your test uses an appropriate extraction step, you could perform a clinical evaluation with samples collected in a larger volume to test the worst case scenario.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: Validation of test for transport media, Changes in collection volume, Matrix equivalency study
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How should matrix equivalency studies be conducted to evaluate the LOD if the transport media or volume is changed?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends validating your test with the transport media specified in your intended use. For matrix equivalency studies, spike swabs with known concentrations in different medium volumes and follow testing instructions, considering dilution factors. Clinical evaluations with larger volumes can test worst-case scenarios if an extraction step is used.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How should matrix equivalency studies be conducted to evaluate the LOD if the transport media or volume is changed?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We do recommend that you validate your test with the transport media identified in your intended use.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Are pre-submissions for non-COVID projects being accepted by the FDA now?
VERBATIM ANSWER: As we've discussed previously, the volume of submissions for COVID tests has impacted our non-COVID work. And we did put out some information, I believe it was last week, about - through a Voices blog about that workload. And we, generally unless an IVD pre-submission is related to COVID-19 companion diagnostics, a breakthrough designation request, or has a significant public health impact, we have been unable to review them and we are using all of the tools at our disposal and we expect at this point, for the remainder of this year, to be declining IVD pre-submission requests that don't fall into those categories.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: Non-COVID pre-submissions, FDA workload impact, Submissions prioritization
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-5
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What categories of non-COVID IVD pre-submissions are currently being reviewed by the FDA?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Currently, FDA is reviewing non-COVID IVD pre-submissions only if they are related to COVID-19 companion diagnostics, a breakthrough designation request, or have a significant public health impact. Other requests will likely be declined for the rest of the year due to high COVID-related workloads.

QA Block 1-6
CLARIFIED QUESTION: For a serology assay developer seeking FDA clearance rather than an EUA, should the submission be de novo or via a 510(k) pathway?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA expects the first serology assay for SARS-CoV-2 seeking clearance outside the EUA provisions to use the de novo pathway. Once classified via this process, subsequent tests may use the 510(k) pathway.
VERBATIM QUESTION: For a serology assay developer seeking FDA clearance rather than an EUA, should the submission be de novo or via a 510(k) pathway?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Since we have not yet authorized a serology assay for SARS-CoV-2 outside of the EUA provisions, we would expect that the first submission would be a de novo request. After we get the first one and are able to classify them through the de novo process, so subsequent tests would be able to come through the 510k pathway.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: Serology assay clearance, de novo pathway, 510(k) pathway
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-7
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is FDA's current guidance or position about the appropriateness of S1 antigen-based serology tests in detecting immune response from COVID-19 vaccines?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA does not have formal guidance on S1 antigen-based serology tests. Current CDC guidelines do not recommend antibody testing to assess COVID-19 immunity post-vaccination, and a protective antibody threshold is not yet established. Further studies are needed to link antibody detection to infection protection.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is FDA's current guidance or position about the appropriateness of S1 antigen-based serology tests in detecting immune response from COVID-19 vaccines?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We generally don't have formal guidance on this topic. We can, you know, point out that the antibody testing guidelines from the CDC states that antibody testing is not currently recommended to assess for immunity to COVID-19 following COVID-19 vaccination. We don't yet know whether the cutoff for available serology tests would be the same as a protective antibody concentration threshold. That has not yet been established for SARS-CoV-2. And further studies would be needed to establish a relationship between the detection or measure of antibodies and protection from infection. So that continues to be a topic of conversation as more scientific and clinical information becomes available.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: S1 antigen serology tests, COVID-19 vaccine immune response, Antibody testing guidance
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-8
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Has the FDA established a cutoff for serology tests that aligns with a protective antibody concentration threshold against SARS-CoV-2?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA has not established a protective antibody concentration threshold for SARS-CoV-2 serology tests, and further studies are required to determine such a relationship.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Has the FDA established a cutoff for serology tests that aligns with a protective antibody concentration threshold against SARS-CoV-2?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We don't yet know whether the cutoff for available serology tests would be the same as a protective antibody concentration threshold. That has not yet been established for SARS-CoV-2. And further studies would be needed to establish a relationship between the detection or measure of antibodies and protection from infection.

QA Block 1-9
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What specific characteristics should a molecular comparator have to streamline test submissions?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends using a molecular comparator with high sensitivity, an extraction step, and EUA authorization. Alterations to an authorized method or using non-EUA tests can cause significant review delays. Consult FDA to ensure the comparator is appropriate.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What specific characteristics should a molecular comparator have to streamline test submissions?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We still recommend that any molecular comparator for any submission be of high sensitivity with an extraction step and that it be EUA authorized as used in the developer's, in the sponsor study. If it is not EUA authorized or if there is an alteration to the authorized method it will cause a significant delay in our review because then we'll be required to bring in a molecular review group to look at the method that you use. So if you want to streamline your submission we recommend you use an EUA authorized test. We also recommend that you check with us first to make sure it's an appropriate molecular comparator. And if there is some requirement by what - for whatever reason for your product, to make an alteration to an EUA authorized product or not use an EUA authorized product, we do recommend you reach out to the FDA and explain that and let's have a discussion, to make sure that, you know, that is the most efficient and best way to go forward. So yes, that's just going to help you, the developer group, to have an efficient review by our teams.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the FDA anticipate a shift toward requiring quantitative tests for assessing immunity in the context of COVID-19?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is actively reviewing the possibility of quantitative tests for immunity assessment but lacks sufficient data currently. It is likely that quantitative tests may eventually become the standard as they have for other infections.
VERBATIM QUESTION: IMPLICIT
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. This is definitely a very active area of review for the FDA. We simply don't have the data and we've checked with our federal government partners to support such immunity claims at this moment. As we have authorized for non-COVID, for certain non-COVID infections where monitoring antibodies and antibody levels have been authorized. So there certainly isn't necessarily any prohibition about moving in this area. We simply wait enough data to understand. It's quite likely that a quantitative test is - a truly quantitative test may be the best answer ultimately, as we have- as those have been primarily if not exclusively, the ones that we've authorized for other amenable infections and the vaccinations for them.

Sponsors should retest frozen specimens with the comparator method before testing with the candidate method, and conduct a fresh versus frozen study to ensure similar performance between sample types. FDA also advises submitting a pre-submission for clinical validation discussions.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA have any expectations on the percentage of fresh versus frozen specimens in a prospective clinical study supporting a 510k submission for SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and RSV multi-analyte molecular RT-PCR tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: To support a 510k we would recommend that your prospective clinical study not exceed 50% frozen prospective specimens. We typically recommend that sponsors retest any frozen specimens with the comparator method prior to testing with the candidate method. And a fresh versus frozen study would establish that the test has similar performance with both sample types. And we've mentioned previously in these town halls as well, that if you're intending to pursue a 510k pathway we recommend that you submit a pre- submission to discuss your clinical validation for review.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Would FDA permit labeling changes to allow authorized manufacturers to make claims about test performance against emerging variants if data is provided as an amendment to an EUA?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Thank you, Richard. Interesting question. I think we'll take that back for dialog within the FDA. We're not - unfortunately we're still staying incredibly busy and we're not looking for additional work to do. On the other hand, variants indications are extremely important. We have been updating labeling when there is a potential issue. And if there's data around a potential issue just the magnitude of that. And we've got guidance out there. we've also got a new Web site. You know, and our pledge to the community is that as soon as we know something that could be an issue of significance in the United States, we will reach out to the developer or developers and assess that. And we're also looking at - ahead to variants that are either extremely low volume in the US or are not here yet but are present in other countries. So we are looking at - in the important variants in other countries that may in fact spread to the US and become dominant enough to affect test performance if there's an issue. You know, I understand your desire here. You know, probably and I'm not - this is not a definitive answer but probably, we'll want to restrict our activities to addressing potential issues with specific tests. And, you know, part of this is we don't want to make work for developers either. You know?

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can two separate EUA request documents for non-prescription home collection combined with molecular PCR at the laboratory be submitted at once, or do they need to be combined into a single document?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Two separate EUA requests for non-prescription home collection and molecular PCR can be combined or submitted separately depending on context. If the collection is intended for one assay and under the same sponsor, one EUA can be submitted. For multiple assays or kits, two requests should be submitted, ideally in separate emails.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can two separate EUA request documents for non-prescription home collection combined with molecular PCR at the laboratory be submitted at once, or do they need to be combined into a single document?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So it can - they can be separate or together in terms of a single EUA versus two EUA requests, depending on your situation. So if you have a home collection kit that you intend to only use with one single assay and they're both under the same EUA sponsor, you can submit that as a single EUA request for the system as a whole, the home collection plus the assay. If you instead intend for the home collection kit to be used with multiple assays and/or you intend for the assay to be able to use multiple home collection kits, then we would want to see two EUA requests so that they can be labeled appropriately. And in that case you could submit them in one email or two, although it is probably a little bit cleaner if you submit them in two emails.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: For EUA submission evaluation of a point of care antigen IVD, can all aspects of patient endpoints and operations be conducted by typical point of care personnel, such as non-laboratory and medical personnel, if performed in a CLIA site but in a separate demarcated area?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends conducting evaluations in actual busy point-of-care sites (e.g., CLIA-waived labs) to ensure robust and accurate results in realistic settings. Simulated point-of-care environments are not recommended. If pursuing this route, contact the FDA staff for discussion.
VERBATIM QUESTION: For EUA submission evaluation of a point of care antigen IVD, can all aspects of patient endpoints and operations be conducted by typical point of care personnel, such as non-laboratory and medical personnel, if performed in a CLIA site but in a separate demarcated area?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We continue to recommend that you use typical point of care sites. You can also use - there's a whole lot more CLIA-waived certificate labs out there including at schools and workplaces. The reason to recommend that these types of settings be used is if they're doing this kind of work, you know, they're a busy situation and they're running a lot - they're doing lots of things all at once. In a typical point of care clinic they're seeing patients for a lot of other issues other than COVID. And they then intersperse work for you or a point of care device if it's already authorized, in all their other work. So we want to see in a busy clinic situation for example, that they still can follow the directions. It's robust enough that they can get the accurate results. So simulated situations for point of care are not something that we would recommend. And if you absolutely have to go that route and I can't dissuade you on this call, then I recommend you reach out to our FDA staff and discuss this with us.

So we want to see in a busy clinic situation for example, that they still can follow the directions. It's robust enough that they can get the accurate results. So simulated situations for point of care are not something that we would recommend. And if you absolutely have to go that route and I can't dissuade you on this call, then I recommend you reach out to our FDA staff and discuss this with us. We are allowing simulated home environments. That's a different situation. Because a home user isn't - they're dedicating their attention to running this test. And rather than require developers to use it in home now we're making it easier to get access to home testing. We're bringing those home users into a simulated home environment but they get no assistance. You know? They're handed the kit and that's it. There's not training or anything.

QA Block 8-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the FDA's reasons for recommending CLIA-waived settings instead of simulated point of care environments for testing performance?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends CLIA-waived settings because they simulate busy, real-life scenarios, testing devices in environments where operators handle multiple tasks simultaneously, ensuring robustness and accuracy. Simulated point of care studies do not replicate these challenges.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the FDA's reasons for recommending CLIA-waived settings instead of simulated point of care environments for testing performance?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We continue to recommend that you use typical point of care sites. You can also use - there's a whole lot more CLIA-waived certificate labs out there including at schools and workplaces. The reason to recommend that these types of settings be used is if they're doing this kind of work, you know, they're a busy situation and they're running a lot - they're doing lots of things all at once. In a typical point of care clinic they're seeing patients for a lot of other issues other than COVID.

#### 11. EUA Requirements for Rapid Antigen Test Submission

QA Block 11-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Would ten asymptomatic COVID-19 positive samples be sufficient to meet the total requirement of more than 30 positive samples for EUA submission?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: For an antigen EUA submission, FDA requires more symptomatic samples to ensure the test's sensitivity is well-documented over days since symptom onset. Ten asymptomatic samples may support the submission, but additional symptomatic samples are necessary to meet confidence interval standards. When both groups are strong, claims for both symptomatic and asymptomatic use may be pursued.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Would ten asymptomatic COVID-19 positive samples be sufficient to meet the total requirement of more than 30 positive samples for EUA submission?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The challenge with an antigen test is we really do want to record the days since symptom onset. So we know how many days that a test is going to be performing well. And so purchasers and users of that test know the window after symptoms for symptomatic patients in which the test performs. So if you include a non-symptomatic patient who legitimately can be COVID positive we're not going to collect that information. And with only 20 or 22 cases our confidence interval of around the sensitivity and the days after symptom onset that it is sensitive enough for authorization, are more limited. So fortunately, you know, it is easier to enroll symptomatic patients in clinical studies and identify them and get them - and get positives that way, than it is asymptomatic. The fact that you have ten asymptomatics and perhaps performance is good in them, is encouraging because it means that once you get those additional symptomatic subjects enrolled and your performance remains good in the symptomatic population, when you submit the data all looks good, you have the opportunity if you wish, to apply not only for symptomatic claims but also asymptomatic screening.

#### 13. Addressing Validation and Usability for COVID-19 Home Tests

QA Block 13-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is it acceptable to have intended users run tests on COVID-positive saliva samples collected elsewhere, given the current difficulties in recruiting positive patients?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA advises that for central lab tests, banked matched saliva samples with corresponding NP swabs and fresh positive samples are required. Due to decreasing COVID positivity rates, this remains challenging for new tests but current validation recommendations have not changed. The FDA suggests submitting a pre-EUA to discuss alternatives.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Hi. My name is Albia Lane. And I have a question about the clinical evaluation study for a molecular test we're developing. So it's been really difficult to recruit positive - COVID positive patients and we're just wondering what if we have some intended users run the tests on COVID positive saliva samples collected elsewhere? Is that a, you know, okay study design given the limitations these days?
VERBATIM ANSWER: If you have a central lab test, moderate or high complexity, you can use banked samples for a molecular test. But they do need, or matched banked saliva samples that you need a matched NP swab for that sample. And you do need to also have some fresh samples, fresh positives. This is going to be extremely challenging. We understand that viral positivity rates in the United States fortunately are going down. Hopefully they stay down. And that there's a challenge for new test developers coming into the market now. And especially challenging subtype, substrates like saliva to get positives. So, you know, I don't think our recommendations for validation are going to change yet, at this time. But do reach out to our staff, to the Templates email address or primarily I think through a pre-EUA. And if you want to suggest alternatives we will review them.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the process for submitting a pre-EUA for a take-home, over-the-counter molecular test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends submitting a pre-EUA request for a take-home, over-the-counter molecular test. This will be challenging for new test developers without prior authorizations, especially for substrates like saliva. Developers must include fresh and matched banked samples for validation. Developers should reach out to FDA staff via the Templates email for further guidance and suggest alternatives if needed.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the process for submitting a pre-EUA for a take-home, over-the-counter molecular test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Okay. So I recommend you come in with a pre-sub, pre-EUA requesting this. That's going to be really, really challenging for a new test that hasn't even received authorizations say for a point of care or for a central lab environment. If you have a central lab test, moderate or high complexity, you can use banked samples for a molecular test.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the standard process for matrix equivalency studies when altering transport media or volume?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends validating tests with identified transport media and performing matrix equivalency studies when altering the volume or type. This involves spiking swabs with known concentrations and following test instructions, accounting for dilution, or conducting a clinical evaluation with larger sample volumes if extraction steps are used.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the standard process for matrix equivalency studies when altering transport media or volume?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We do recommend that you validate your test with the transport media identified in your intended use. Media is provided in a range of volumes and you should specify in your LOD testing what volume you tested and note that that's the average or expected fill volume in the VTM provided by the vendor. If you're trying to change the transport media or the volume for your test, we would recommend performing a matrix equivalency study to evaluate the LOD. And you can start with a swab spiked with known concentrations placed in different volumes of the same collection medium and follow the testing instructions for your test. That should take into account the dilution factor there. You can also, if your test uses an appropriate extraction step, you could perform a clinical evaluation with samples collected in a larger volume to test the worst case scenario.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the brand of oral swab need to be specified on a home collection kit EUA request?
VERBATIM ANSWER: It's preferred that it be registered. If it's not, I would have a dialog with our staff. And if - and in the submission I would state all the details of the swab used in the study. Now when it comes down to it, if there are a need for a developer pre-authorization, to switch swabs, we'd want to know about it in our review. But also post authorization in order to keep supplies on market, we're going to, you know, expect that if it's otherwise the same exact swab, i.e. the same material, the same type of swab, that that validation can be done internal to the developer.
