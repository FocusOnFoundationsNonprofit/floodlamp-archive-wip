#### 1. FDA Guidance on SARS-CoV-2 Testing and Validation.

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is pooling considered screening or surveillance when collecting a ten-swab pool where all the swabs are placed into the same transport tube with media and specimens are recollected for individual results?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Pooling is considered screening if specimen collection results in determining the COVID-19 status of individual participants for actions based on those results.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is pooling considered screening or surveillance when collecting a ten-swab pool where all the swabs are placed into the same transport tube with media and specimens are recollected for individual results?
VERBATIM ANSWER: This is regarding the use of pooling and in what situations that is considered screening versus surveillance. We have gotten a number of questions about surveillance versus screening and it is a tricky topic. So we did clarify with this specific situation that was asking about collecting a ten-swab pool where all the swabs are placed into the same transport tube with media. With the assumption that you plan to recollect specimens from each of those individuals if the pool is positive, where the intent is to determine each individual's COVID-19 status for SARS-CoV-2 positive or negative status -- such that that individual could or would take action based on that result. So in that case the testing protocol that was proposed appears to be screening since it is intended for individual action.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: Pooling and screening, Surveillance testing, COVID-19 diagnostic protocols
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the recommendations for validating asymptomatic screenings when there is already an EUA for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends following the main molecular EUA template for individual asymptomatic screening claims. For serial screening claims, as per the supplemental EUA template, pre-authorization data is likely not needed. A supplemental EUA request should be submitted with the proposed serial testing interval and post-authorization validation study.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the recommendations for validating asymptomatic screenings when there is already an EUA for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Our recommendation generally for validating asymptomatic screening are included in the main molecular EUA template if you are interested in an individual screening claim. If you are interested in the serial screening claim as outlined in the supplemental EUA template, you likely don't need any additional pre-authorization data. In that case we recommend that you submit a supplemental EUA request with your requested indication including the serial testing interval and your proposed post authorization validation study.

QA Block 1-6
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is the serial testing approach acceptable for antigen assays that do not reach 80% sensitivity in symptomatic individuals?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Serial testing may be supported for antigen tests with sensitivity under 80%, but clinical evaluation in asymptomatic populations must be completed before screening claims can be authorized. Post-authorization validation shifts are not allowed for tests below 80% sensitivity.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is the serial testing approach acceptable for antigen assays that do not reach 80% sensitivity in symptomatic individuals?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We do discuss in the antigen template for test developers that strategies for serial testing with less sensitive tests such as the PPO less than 80% may be able to support authorization. But in those cases we would expect the clinical evaluation in an asymptomatic population to be completed prior to authorization of a screening claim. The shift of the validation to post authorization discussed in the supplemental template is not applicable for tests with sensitivity below 80% in symptomatic subjects.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE

#### 2. EUA Submission Process and Data Guidelines for Diagnostic Tests

QA Block 2-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the process for submitting data to OIR for an EUA?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA provides EUA templates for serology, antigen, and molecular tests on its website, and requests submission to cdrh-eua-templates@fda.hhs.gov. Submitted data is reviewed for sufficiency, and if supported, the FDA issues authorization and adds the test to its landing page.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the process for submitting data to OIR for an EUA?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We do have the EUA templates for serology, antigen and molecular test up on our Web site and ask that you submit your EUA request to cdrh-eua-templates@fda.hhs.gov. Those templates generally reflect our current thinking on the data and information that developers should submit to facilitate the EUA review process. Once we receive that we review your EUA request and determine whether it is sufficient to support an EUA authorization. And then at that point if we do believe it's sufficient, we would authorize the test then issue the sponsor letter of authorization and add that test to the FDA landing page.

QA Block 2-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: For an OTC antigen test, is it necessary for the data to show a minimum of 80% agreement with a predicate to be considered for EUA approval?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA clarified that EUA reviews do not involve predicates as substantial equivalence determinations are not applicable. For OTC antigen tests, a minimum of 90% PPA compared to a comparator test is recommended, while 80% PPA is recommended for serial testing claims in symptomatic individuals.
VERBATIM QUESTION: For an OTC antigen test, is it necessary for the data to show a minimum of 80% agreement with a predicate to be considered for EUA approval?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So just to clarify some terminology there, for an EUA review, it is different than a 510k review. So for an EUA, it is not a substantial equivalence determination so there is no predicate. But we do often, you know, ask for a comparator test to be used in your clinical evaluation so I think that's likely what this question is referring to. And we do recommend for OTC tests in the antigen the - sorry, the non-lab template, we do recommend a minimum of 90% PPA for OTC tests as compared to the comparator test.

#### 3. BioFire de Novo as Predicate for 510(k) Submissions

QA Block 3-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is the BioFire test the only one that can be used as a predicate for subsequent submissions by other manufacturers?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The BioFire test is the only legally marketed predicate for a 510(k) submission until other tests are cleared through the 510(k) pathway. For clinical evaluation comparators, BioFire or an EUA-authorized, highly sensitive RT-PCR assay can be used. FDA recommends submitting a pre-submission to discuss validation strategies and comparator methods when pursuing the 510(k) pathway.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is the BioFire test the only one that can be used as a predicate for subsequent submissions by other manufacturers?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So since BioFire was entered a de novo they are currently the only legally marketed predicate for a 510k submission until subsequent tests are also cleared through the 510k pathway. So for future 510k submissions BioFire is currently the predicate to use there. But for your comparator, for your clinical evaluation you can use BioFire but you also can use an EUA authorized highly sensitive RT-PCR assay for the clinical evaluation as well as for EUA requests. And we do recommend that if you intend to pursue the 510k pathway that you submit a pre-submission to discuss your proposed validation strategies and your comparator methods.

QA Block 4-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is FDA open to the use of archived specimens to pursue clearance of an extended respiratory panel including flu A, flu B, RSV A&B, and SARS-CoV-2?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA is open to the use of archived specimens for EUA clearance of a respiratory panel including flu A, flu B, RSV A&B, and SARS-CoV-2. However, a prospective clinical study is generally required. During the public health emergency, archived samples may be tested at one site, but post-authorization, FDA requires further prospective studies at multiple sites.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is FDA open to the use of archived specimens to pursue clearance of an extended respiratory panel including flu A, flu B, RSV A&B, and SARS-CoV-2?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So generally to evaluate the clinical performance of your multi-analyte test a prospective clinical study should be conducted. Considering the public health needs in the current emergency, a clinical performance study in support of your EUA request may be conducted at one site testing archived, positive and negative clinical samples with known specimen types. The pre-selection of archived positive samples should represent a range of viral load or CT values including low positive samples near the assay's cut off. And since this is typically for a device that has not been -- excuse me -- FDA cleared for the respiratory pathogens included in the test and it's likely that the test will be used in patients with respiratory symptoms in lieu of an FDA cleared respiratory panel, we do intend to include a condition of authorization that you conduct a post EUA the post authorization prospective clinical study that would include a minimum of three sample collection sites and three testing sites prospectively in patients with general respiratory symptoms.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: Use of archived specimens, EUA for respiratory panel, Prospective studies
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 4-5
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Will EUAs for non-identical tests to BioFire remain valid despite the transition of BioFire's test to a de novo authorization?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA confirms that the BioFire de novo authorization does not affect EUAs for non-identical tests. Only the EUA for the identical test was impacted and revoked upon granting of the de novo authorization.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Will EUAs for non-identical tests to BioFire remain valid despite the transition of BioFire's test to a de novo authorization?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The BioFire de novo does not impact any EUAs other than their own for that identical test which we revoked concurrent to granting the de novo for the same test. BioFire's other EUAs including the point of care test as well as EUAs for other - where other developers were not impacted.

REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 4-6
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What options does the FDA provide for developers if viruses like influenza and RSV are at low prevalence during clinical studies?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA allows developers to use archived specimens for evaluating clinical performance during EUA requests and for pursuing full authorizations when low virus prevalence makes prospective studies infeasible. These studies must represent various viral loads and include conditions for post-market prospective studies.
VERBATIM QUESTION: IMPLICIT
VERBATIM ANSWER: Considering the public health needs in the current emergency, a clinical performance study in support of your EUA request may be conducted at one site testing archived, positive and negative clinical samples with known specimen types. The pre-selection of archived positive samples should represent a range of viral load or CT values including low positive samples near the assay's cut off. And since this is typically for a device that has not been FDA cleared for the respiratory pathogens included in the test and it's likely that the test will be used in patients with respiratory symptoms in lieu of an FDA cleared respiratory panel, we do intend to include a condition of authorization that you conduct a post EUA the post authorization prospective clinical study that would include a minimum of three sample collection sites and three testing sites prospectively in patients with general respiratory symptoms.

#### 5. EUA Requirements for Prescription and OTC Lateral Flow Tests

QA Block 5-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the differences in EUA requirements between prescription use lateral flow antigen tests and non-prescription use lateral flow antigen tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA requires clinical evaluation to be conducted in settings corresponding to test indication. Asymptomatic screening claims require population-based validation. OTC tests for lay users also need usability and user comprehension data, while serial screening claims may rely on symptomatic validation per the supplemental template.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the differences in EUA requirements between prescription use lateral flow antigen tests and non-prescription use lateral flow antigen tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Generally the recommendation for analytical and clinical validation are included in the EUA template. And we expect that the clinical evaluation be conducted in the appropriate setting such as point of care or at home depending on the proposed indication. If you are seeking an asymptomatic screening claim you should validate in that population. Though as we have discussed in the supplemental template issued last week you may request a serial screening claim based only on symptomatic validation.

#### 9. Using RT-PCR as Standard for Comparisons

QA Block 9-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is it possible to use an EUA authorized serology test as a comparator rather than an RT-PCR test for the clinical agreement study?

#### 10. Evaluating Serology Tests for Vaccine Response Effectiveness

QA Block 10-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Would a serology assay that looks at the spike protein potentially be a candidate for vaccine response?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Serology assays targeting the spike protein might be candidates for vaccine response, but their applicability depends on the vaccine. Clinical studies are required to validate such claims, and the FDA is open to submissions that clarify test capabilities.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Would a serology assay that looks at the spike protein potentially be a candidate for vaccine response?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So I think this may be vaccine specific and if a test wants to make a claim that they can detect a specific response then a clinical study, you know, should demonstrate that. So, you know, we don't object clinicians ordering tests off- label. They do that fairly frequently. They prescribe drugs off-label. When they do that they are taking more responsibility obviously for the use of that test or possibly drug. And we just wanted to make sure that they were aware that not every serology test that we have authorized can detect an immune response to every one of the vaccines we haven't analyzed that. But clearly if there is a mis-match then you would theoretically know that an end protein management test would not be positive if the patient has only received a spike protein vaccine. And again we are open to submissions that at least want to clarify this and as this goes forward and clinicians use serology tests in this manner even though they are not authorized for this, we want to make sure that its clear, you know, that, you know, certain tests could potentially be used. So I'm not sure how we are going to do that but we are open to response to what test developers want to do in that regard and so it's probably best to come in with a pre-EUA with something you would like to do and suggest along with some sort of study design.

REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 10-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Was it just that particular issue or situation regarding serology tests that were not candidates, and not a blanket statement about all serology tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA clarified that the issue is a theoretical mismatch, not a blanket statement that serology tests are unsuitable. Compatibility depends on the antigen in the vaccine and the serology test, and data is needed to support claims of effectiveness.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Was it just that particular issue or situation regarding serology tests that were not candidates, and not a blanket statement about all serology tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, it's a theoretical mis-match. But again you can have a spike protein vaccine - not again but I would say that you could have a, you know, a spike protein vaccine that may not overlap entirely or completely or even at all perhaps with a spike protein. An antigen test depending on what's the antigen in the vaccine and what's the antigen in the serology test. So just because it…make a blank statement that a spike protein serology test, you know, works for a given spike protein vaccine. We would like certainly to make that claim and we would like to look at data that supports that.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: The BioFire de novo is a predicate for all SARS tests, applicable to full and EUA authorizations. Currently, the BioFire is the only predicate for 510k submissions until more SARS-CoV-2 tests are authorized, but other high sensitivity RT-PCR tests may be comparators for clinical evaluation.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is the BioFire de novo now the predicate for all COVID NAT tests or only for multi-plex respiratory panel type NAT tests that include COVID?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So I will let Toby fill in any gaps here but it's a predicate for all SARS tests. It can be used for full authorization comparisons and it also can be used for EUA authorization comparison. We are going to continue to be open for other comparators to be used for EUA authorizations as well as for full authorization because there may be not full availability for everybody to get a limited number of fully authorized tests until we get to that point. Once we get to that point where there is plenty of availability of fully authorized tests, you know, we will see what we do at that point. And I would just add that the - yes, until there are more 510ks authorized for SARS-CoV-2 whether as a single analyte or a multi-analyte test the BioFire is the only predicate for a 510k. But as Timothy said, we do, you know, we will consider other high sensitivity RT-PCR tests as the comparator for your clinical evaluation.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the FDA have standard criteria for PPA and NPA specifically for molecular tests in the asymptomatic post-authorization clinical study?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA does not yet have a pre-set threshold for PPA and NPA in asymptomatic screening performance for molecular tests due to insufficient data. They ideally expect PAA above 80% for serial testing programs but are not making firm recommendations now.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA have standard criteria for PPA and NPA specifically for molecular tests in the asymptomatic post-authorization clinical study?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So, you know, for molecular tests in symptomatic populations, you know, are above the 95% PPA in comparison to another EUAs authorized test. We would expect that, you know, a once weekly serial testing program with a molecular test would yield a very high PPA even in the asymptomatic population. Based on the recent data that has been a pre-print out, of a study that was sponsored by NIH and also other data that we have available. So we don't have a pre-set threshold for the asymptomatic screening performance because we just haven't seen enough data and we haven't seen other than the research study that was performed, we haven't seen to my knowledge a serial testing submission so we could see what the data looked like. So once we get experience on what tests generally are able to achieve and there may be differences between molecular and antigen tests for example because antigen tests are typically less sensitive than molecular tests it was difficult to set an expectation.

VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, because there is already FDA cleared influenza tests on the market, we are wanting to make sure that performance of EUA panel tests that are new that we haven't seen before for flu A and B that they perform at an acceptable level and we are asking for archived samples. This is sort of the first time I have heard that archived samples are not available for flu A and B. You can always send an email with a pre-EUA to our template's box. But until we know what flu A and B banks are depleted for clinical samples, we would still like to see archived samples prior to EUA authorization. And then as we discussed we would ask to see a prospective study post- authorization to be able to be considered for EUA authorization. So you explain your challenges in trying to obtain these archived samples. But again this is an area where we have already cleared flu A and B and they are available in the market and so we are being cautious.

For molecular tests, monitoring involves assessing primers, probes, and cycling parameters. For serology tests, the antigen sequence must be monitored for changes in the SARS database. Similarly, antigen test developers must map antibody-virus binding and review antigen sequences.

Molecular tests are relatively straight forward in that, you know, the sequence of the primers and probes, you can do calculations around melting temperatures and know what your cycling parameters are or your isothermal parameters are. And determine with some modeling, simple modeling, whether or not your assay potentially could be affected. Serology tests are more challenging. We are all current in serology testing in review, we are now asking for the antigen sequence that you are using and we are logging that into our database. Obviously it's an amino acid sequence and so we would be scanning the nucleic acid sequence database for SARS for any amino acid changes within the antigen portion of the serology tests and we would ask developers to do the same for antibody tests - for serology tests. For antigen tests there is a different pathway. Developers would need to understand the characteristics of the antibodies that they use in their antigen test and know the map of, you know, the antibody binding to the virus which is specific for every type of antibody that's monoclonal. Polyclonal will have, you know, different things to look for. But and there it may depend on, a polyclonal antibody, it may depend on what the antigen was used and the sequence of that antigen to raise the antibodies for that antigen test.

Developers should also monitor for amino acid changes in SARS-CoV-2 sequences corresponding to the antigen portion of their tests, using the US circulating sequence database.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the FDA's expectations for developers regarding the sequence analysis for SARS-CoV-2 in serology tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We are all current in serology testing in review, we are now asking for the antigen sequence that you are using and we are logging that into our database. Obviously it's an amino acid sequence and so we would be scanning the nucleic acid sequence database for SARS for any amino acid changes within the antigen portion of the serology tests and we would ask developers to do the same for antibody tests - for serology tests. It all starts with the specific knowledge of your own test and examination of sequences in the US circulating sequence database.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What information should antigen test developers provide about antibodies used in their tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA expects antigen test developers to understand the characteristics of the antibodies used in their tests, including binding specificity for monoclonal antibodies and antigen sequence information for polyclonal antibodies. Developers should submit a plan that includes considerations based on their test's specific attributes.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What information should antigen test developers provide about antibodies used in their tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Developers would need to understand the characteristics of the antibodies that they use in their antigen test and know the map of, you know, the antibody binding to the virus which is specific for every type of antibody that's monoclonal. Polyclonal will have, you know, different things to look for. But and there it may depend on, a polyclonal antibody, it may depend on what the antigen was used and the sequence of that antigen to raise the antibodies for that antigen test. So every test developer has some different things that they can do and we are just asking that they come in with a plan.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What recommendations does the FDA have for developers submitting supplemental EUA requests for serial testing claims?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Developers submitting supplemental EUA requests for serial testing claims do not generally need additional pre-authorization data. FDA recommends including the requested indication, serial testing interval, and proposed post-authorization validation study in the submission.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What recommendations does the FDA have for developers submitting supplemental EUA requests for serial testing claims?
VERBATIM ANSWER: If you are interested in the serial screening claim as outlined in the supplemental EUA template, you likely don't need any additional pre-authorization data. In that case we recommend that you submit a supplemental EUA request with your requested indication including the serial testing interval and your proposed post authorization validation study.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can serial testing be used for symptomatic individuals if an antigen test does not meet 80% sensitivity thresholds?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Serial testing may support authorization for antigen tests with sensitivity under 80%, but clinical evaluation in asymptomatic individuals must be completed before authorization. Validation criteria shifting to post-authorization does not apply to such tests.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can serial testing be used for symptomatic individuals if an antigen test does not meet 80% sensitivity thresholds?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Regarding serial testing we also received a question about antigen tests and whether the serial testing approach would be acceptable if the antigen assay does not reach the 80% sensitivity in symptomatic individuals. We do discuss in the antigen template for test developers that strategies for serial testing with less sensitive tests such as the PPO less than 80% may be able to support authorization. But in those cases we would expect the clinical evaluation in an asymptomatic population to be completed prior to authorization of a screening claim. The shift of the validation to post authorization discussed in the supplemental template is not applicable for tests with sensitivity below 80% in symptomatic subjects.

VERBATIM QUESTION: What PPA do you recommend for OTC antigen tests in the non-lab template compared to the comparator test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: For an EUA review, it is different than a 510k review. So for an EUA, it is not a substantial equivalence determination so there is no predicate. But we do often, you know, ask for a comparator test to be used in your clinical evaluation so I think that's likely what this question is referring to. And we do recommend for OTC tests in the antigen the - sorry, the non-lab template, we do recommend a minimum of 90% PPA for OTC tests as compared to the comparator test. And in the new supplemental template issued last week we recommend a minimum of 80% PPA for serial testing claims.

Specific thresholds for high or low volume are not defined, but inquiries can be directed to the EUA mailbox with test details.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What constitutes significant testing capacity when prioritizing EUA requests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We do prioritize review of EUA requests where authorization would significantly increase testing capacity such as tests that reduce reliance on test supplies and try to report widely distributed tests to address public health needs. We can't unfortunately provide specific numbers of what we consider to be high or low volume or throughput. But if you need help determining whether your test would be considered high testing capacity we recommend that you reach out through the EUA mailbox with information about the features of your test.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: For home collection kits, does the FDA require the review of shipping stability studies prior to EUA authorization?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA requires the review of shipping stability studies prior to EUA authorization for home collection kits. In certain cases, such as using an already authorized collection system, a right of reference may apply. Proprietary devices require repeated studies.
VERBATIM QUESTION: For home collection kits, does the FDA require the review of shipping stability studies prior to EUA authorization?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So for a home collection situation we are asking to review that shipping stability study prior to authorization. If you were already using something for which we have authorized and managed for a right of reference such as the Gates collection study. You could potentially if you use the sort of exact same things you can potentially fall under that right of reference that gates has offered and you can ask about that in the submission. But if you have a specifically proprietary unique device then those stability studies would need to be repeated.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the stability data requirements for collection kits intended for professional use or point-of-care settings?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: For professional use or point-of-care settings, kits making claims for SARS or SARS panels are treated as devices, requiring shipping stability data. Proprietary collection devices require specific data, while widely used standard devices like nasal swabs may not need additional data.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the stability data requirements for collection kits intended for professional use or point-of-care settings?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So for professional use these are collection kits. Toby, you can help me out here. But if a kit makes a claim about use of the collection kit in for SARS or SARS plus a panel we would treat that as a device and we would ask for and obviously to be shipped and so we would look at the same sort of things there. Toby, did I get that right? Right. If it's some, you know, proprietary collection device we would expect to see information on the specific collection device including some of the stability data if you are, you know, simply using previously, you know, widely marketed, you know, a standard nasal swab and things like that then we are not likely to have additional questions.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Is there an upper age limit for individuals included in the intended use population for OTC designation?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. And then above 14 to above 65, you know, we would like to see, you know, obviously there is different potential issues in some groups so I would to see a good range so, you know, include those who are 65 plus and typically, you know, those we enrolled in age 14 to 65 is in typically depending on how many enrollees you have in your study you are going to see a good range on that. But make sure you have got representatives of those below 14 and those above 65 and then probably have plenty between the two.
