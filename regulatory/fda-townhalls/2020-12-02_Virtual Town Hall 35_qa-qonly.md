CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is included in the new consolidated serology EUA template for test developers?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The new consolidated serology EUA template combines the templates for commercial manufacturers and laboratories into a single template for test developers. Additionally, a separate template for home specimen collection using finger stick dried blood spot is also available on the IVD EUA page.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is included in the new consolidated serology EUA template for test developers?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We posted two serology templates, EUA templates on our EUA page. One is the serology template for test developers and that replaced both the serology template for commercial manufacturers and the serology template for laboratories, so it's a single template for test developers now. And we also added a home specimen collection serology template for finger stick dried blood spot. So those are both available on the IVD EUA page.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: serology EUA template, test development, home specimen collection
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-5
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the requirements for home specimen collection and dried blood spot serology tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA has provided a cleared template for serology home collection by dried blood spot, available on their website. Developers should focus on the volume requirements to ensure sufficient samples for accurate results and simplify use for end-users, whether for prescription or over-the-counter contexts.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the requirements for home specimen collection and dried blood spot serology tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Toby mentioned that we made available a template now that was cleared. And we have been providing advice on a case by case basis, for serology home collection by blood spot. And so we're happy to make that that is cleared and that is on our Web site and available for developers who are interested in that. You know, there are perhaps volume requirements for home serology collection and home serology testing. So we advise developers to pay attention to what those volume requirement are. Obviously, we've got to have enough of a sample in order to get an accurate result. And how that - and how to make that as easy as possible, for end users for the patients and those who would buy an OTC test for those studies. Just a heads up to pay attention to those needs for your assay and then how you make the validation, you know, in the home use either by prescription or OTC environment in the most expeditious study manner.

QA Block 1-8
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the priority areas for diagnostic test reviews, including point of care, home, and OTC tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA prioritizes reviewing more point-of-care tests, prescription home tests, OTC tests, and flu and respiratory panels, along with increasing throughput for central lab tests.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the priority areas for diagnostic test reviews, including point of care, home, and OTC tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: I did want to reiterate our current thinking on the top, top, top priorities. And still probably mainly overall, for the office, although it doesn't functionally matter because we have separate teams for antigen, molecular and serology. So it doesn't mean that there's necessarily strong competition across those buckets for submissions. We do try to balance the review staff to the workload. Those silos or buckets, operate independently of one another, all the way through authorization and other decisions. What we're hearing and what we believe is absolutely needed, is more availability for point of care tests, more availability for prescription home collection and prescription home tests, as well as OTC collection and OTC testing. And so those basically are our top priority. Panels that include flu and other respiratory viruses also are a priority. As are truly steps forward in throughput capability for central lab tests. And so probably none of those are surprises to anyone. And we remain eager to authorize good tests in those categories as soon as possible.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Diagnostic test review priorities, Point-of-care and home testing, OTC and central lab testing
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-9
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the validation and study requirements for semi-quant assays to become authorized?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA advises developers of semi-quant assays to provide calibrators, likely at least two points, and address intended use with data that may include significant clinical studies. FDA plans to be flexible and minimally burdensome, requiring evidence to support claims but noting challenges like the lack of an international standard.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the validation and study requirements for semi-quant assays to become authorized?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We anticipate that for those that are interested that - in the molecular and antigen space for developers to come in for EUA authorization of semi-quant perhaps leading to the quant assay. Then we'll go through those who want it now before the international standard is available and we'll go through a semi-quant authorization pathway. And of course you need calibrators for that, probably at least a two point. And so there's an important development of those calibrators and it's important development of how you're going to assay the semi-quant and what sort of meaning it is. We're also potentially challenged on the science around, you know, intended use for semi-quant and quant assays, to actually show say correlations on important clinical factor. You put in there what you want. Could involve to generate the data that supports that, could involve a significant clinical study. You know, in order to authorize a semi-quant or quant assay, you know, I think we're going to be as flexible and adaptable as possible. And we're not going to be overburdensome on what those claims are at least as far as they don't claim things that aren't supported by actual data.

SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Authorization of semi-quant assays, Validation requirements, Clinical studies
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-10
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the challenges with using cycle thresholds for molecular assay quantitation?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The challenges with using cycle thresholds (CTs) for molecular assay quantitation involve sampling variability, viral stability issues, and interpretation difficulties on an individual patient basis. Comparing CTs between assays without addressing variable factors can lead to inaccurate results, and even within an assay, lot-to-lot variability can alter results. These factors make CT standardization and accuracy complex.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the challenges with using cycle thresholds for molecular assay quantitation?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Due to sampling variabilities, other issues having to do with viral stability, exactly how that precisely and accurately correlates to what's going on in the patients, maybe a different question. On a case - individual patient by individual patient basis, there are potential challenges in interpreting CT results. There are also technical hurdles with CTs. So CTs across molecular assays that aren't made semi-quant or quant, so that you're actually not really focusing on CTs but you're focusing on actual viral target levels. But if you just try to compare CTs assay to assay and you haven't controlled for variables, that's an imprecise, inaccurate, challenging correlation. And even for a given assay there could be - there absolutely is the chance and many times there is the variability around lot to lot variability. So every time you take a new lot of master mix you can upset the delicate balance a little bit and alter the readout ever so slightly. So when selecting CTs for cutoff I mean hopefully that's, you know, there's a fairly flexible within the variability range, to set that. And you're not, you know, you're not getting false positives and you're not getting unintended false negatives. And - but this is a highly technical area to move towards true quantitation probably through the process of developing a semi-quant assay.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Cycle thresholds, Molecular assay quantitation, Technical challenges
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-11
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What factors cause variability in molecular assay results, such as lot-to-lot differences?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Variability in molecular assay results can arise from sampling variabilities, viral stability issues, interpretation of CT results, and technical hurdles. Lot-to-lot differences, such as with master mix, can alter the balance and slightly modify results.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What factors cause variability in molecular assay results, such as lot-to-lot differences?

QA Block 1-12
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What does the FDA recommend as steps toward true quantitation in molecular assays without an international standard?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA suggests moving toward true quantitation in molecular assays by initially developing a semi-quant approach. Without an international standard, FDA recommends using a pathway for EUA semi-quant assay authorization, requiring at least two-point calibrators, until such a standard becomes available.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What does the FDA recommend as steps toward true quantitation in molecular assays without an international standard?
VERBATIM ANSWER: This is a highly technical area to move towards true quantitation probably through the process of developing a semi-quant assay. First, since we don't have yet a recognized international standard which is really ideal and/or necessary for a true quantitative assay, so that all assays can be harmonized around that international standard and compare results assay to assay, lot to lot, et cetera. So for the serology assays, we've been authorizing semi-quant because there isn't yet an international recognized standard for serology. We anticipate that for those that are interested that - in the molecular and antigen space for developers to come in for EUA authorization of semi-quant perhaps leading to the quant assay. Then we'll go through those who want it now before the international standard is available and we'll go through a semi-quant authorization pathway. And of course you need calibrators for that, probably at least a two point. And so there's an important development of those calibrators and it's important development of how you're going to assay the semi-quant and what sort of meaning it is.

QA Block 1-14
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What challenges exist in demonstrating clinical utility for semi-quant and quant assays?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Challenges include proving the intended use by demonstrating correlations between the assay results and clinically significant factors, which may require substantial clinical studies. The FDA aims to be flexible while ensuring claims are supported by data.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What challenges exist in demonstrating clinical utility for semi-quant and quant assays?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We're also potentially challenged on the science around, you know, intended use for semi-quant and quant assays, to actually show say correlations on important clinical factor.

QA Block 1-15
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What flexibility does the FDA offer in authorizing semi-quantitative or quantitative assays?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA has authorized some quant and semi-quant assays, including serology. There's interest in molecular and antigen assays. Without international standards, developers can pursue EUA through semi-quant pathways, which involve calibrators and focus on assay precision and variability. The FDA aims to be flexible upfront with potential post-market checks.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What flexibility does the FDA offer in authorizing semi-quantitative or quantitative assays?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We have authorized some semi-quant and quant assays. We have already authorized some serology quant assays. In non-serology quant and semi-quant submissions, there are either few or none depending on the category. There seems to be interest in having semi-quant and quant molecular assays and perhaps antigen assays, so clinicians have an additional tool to make assessments. There are no recognized international standards yet, but we anticipate developers interested in this will come forward for EUA authorization using a semi-quant pathway leading to quant assays. These pathways involve calibrators, typically at least two-point, and a focus on the assay's dynamic range, upper and lower quant limits, and lot-to-lot variability. The FDA aims to be as flexible and minimally burdensome as possible for authorization, with potential post-market commitments to ensure accuracy.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the FDA's expectations and recommendations regarding pre-EUA and EUA submission feedback?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is receiving a high volume of pre-EUA and EUA submissions and has increased reviewers to speed up decisions and reduce backlog. To streamline feedback, the FDA encourages developers to fully address questions after the first round and adhere to recommended templates. While not mandatory, following these recommendations helps expedite decisions. The FDA aims to fairly handle all applications efficiently.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the FDA's expectations and recommendations regarding pre-EUA and EUA submission feedback?
VERBATIM ANSWER: And these are having to do with submissions of pre-EUAs and EUAs. And we're obviously still getting a lot of them. We have surged our reviewers; we have a surge of effort bringing reviewers from other areas into this effort, to try to, you know, make decisions much more quickly and reduce the list of open submissions. I'm happy to report that as of the end of last week, we have turned that corner and we are reducing the overall amount of open submissions, both originals and supplements. So the surge is working. We hope that it will accelerate. We do ask for your help. You know, due to the overwhelming interest by developers still, in pre- EUAs and EUAs we want to try to limit our feedback on pre-EUAs and EUAs, to one round. I know this is challenging. We want to be fair to all developers; we want to move through applications as quickly and expeditiously as possible, to come to a decision point. And so we would ask that you work closely with us and when we have questions you completely address those after say a first round of questions, if there are some. And then we want to really close those applications out. In pre-EUAs we're going to use templates to the greatest extent possible, or prepared language to the greatest extent possible. I want to make it clear that our templates and our thoughts in these communications even on EUAs, are recommendations. If something goes a little off recommendation it is going to slow us down. So while they're not firm and fast requirements necessarily, our recommendations are well thought out, they're streamlined. We're dealing with this volume of applications and we want to be fair to all. So, you know, those that follow our recommendations, they could have a more expeditious pathway through to the decision point.

#### 2. Interpreting Serology Test Results and Associated Risks

QA Block 2-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How does FDA assess the severity of various outcomes associated with incorrect usage of COVID-19 antibody test kits, specifically regarding the presence of antibodies not conferring protective immunity?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA highlights false positives, false negatives, and the risk of overinterpreting serology results as significant issues. While serology test performance may be slightly lower than molecular or antigen tests, FDA stresses the importance of interpretation by clinicians, particularly for over-the-counter usage to avoid mismanagement of results.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How does FDA assess the severity of various outcomes associated with incorrect usage of COVID-19 antibody test kits, specifically regarding the presence of antibodies not conferring protective immunity?
VERBATIM ANSWER: False positives, false negatives and overinterpretation of the final - of the findings for serology, obviously no test is 100% specific or sensitive. Serology may be a little bit lower on the scale of the test that we authorize, being that we allow, you know, 90% for the IDG sensitivity PPA, and down to 70% for IGM sensitivity PPA. And then obviously, sometimes for some devices, the specificity may be a bit lower than what we may have seen for other devices. Typically, molecular devices, you know, are highly specific. Typically, above 99% some can fall. Depending on the size of the trial and how the chance falls out who you test and how you test might be as little as 98%. Typically molecular assays are in those high 90s. For antigen tests, what we have seen pretty consistently, is somewhere around a 98% specificity in the marketplace in real-world situations. And then for serology, we do know that it can fall down to, you know, 95% for those that we may have authorized. Obviously we're still examining data, accumulating data, trying to understand performance. So when you don't have - I think what you're asking is when you don't have a clinician involved say in the home, even though we do in our first home test and in our home collections, but primarily home tests because either by prescription, because, you know, it's difficult to enforce shall we say, that a patient will follow up with their clinician and to interpret the results. But with an OTC there is no expectation that anybody will follow up with their clinician and we want them to properly interpret potential false positives, potential false negatives and not to overinterpret the result that they receive.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the FDA expect developers of home tests to include explicit warnings about scenarios in which results may be misinterpreted?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA expects developers to clearly inform users of potential misinterpretations, particularly in over-the-counter (OTC) home tests, as these lack clinician involvement for result interpretation.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA expect developers of home tests to include explicit warnings about scenarios in which results may be misinterpreted?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Obviously, sometimes for some devices, the specificity may be a bit lower than what we may have seen for other devices. Typically, molecular devices, you know, are highly specific. Typically, above 99% some can fall. Depending on the size of the trial and how the chance falls out who you test and how you test might be as little as 98%. Typically molecular assays are in those high 90s. For antigen tests, what we have seen pretty consistently, is somewhere around a 98% specificity in the marketplace in real world situations. And then for serology, we do know that it can fall down to, you know, 95% for those that we may have authorized. Obviously we're still examining data, accumulating data, trying to understand performance. So when you don't have - I think what you're asking is when you don't have a clinician involved say in the home, even though we do in our first home test and in our home collections, but primarily home tests because either by prescription, because, you know, it's difficult to enforce shall we say, that a patient will follow up with their clinician and to interpret the results. But with an OTC there is no expectation that anybody will follow up with their clinician and we want them to properly interpret potential false positives, potential false negatives and not to overinterpret the result that they receive.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA assesses COVID-19 serology test performance by reviewing sensitivity, specificity, and real-world data, noting authorized serology tests usually show 95% specificity, though lower than molecular or antigen tests.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How is the FDA currently assessing and interpreting the performance data for COVID-19 serology tests, including in real-world scenarios?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Serology may be a little bit lower on the scale of the test that we authorize, being that we allow, you know, 90% for the IDG sensitivity PPA, and down to 70% for IGM sensitivity PPA. And then obviously, sometimes for some devices, the specificity may be a bit lower than what we may have seen for other devices. Typically, molecular devices, you know, are highly specific. Typically, above 99% some can fall. Depending on the size of the trial and how the chance falls out who you test and how you test might be as little as 98%.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Should serology tests be used for diagnostic purposes or to determine immunity, based on current FDA guidance?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Or promoting things beyond what serology can support. You know, making a determination oh, you can go back to work now because you're antibody positive with one test. Oh, you are not going to be able to get it again. You know, you're not going to be able to pass along the infection. You know, or using it for diagnostic purposes. Oh, you know you're positive, you know, you could be infectious. You know? It's not the right test for that. It's not the right test for that.

#### 4. FDA Guidelines for IVD vs RUO Validation and Authorization

QA Block 4-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the FDA's recommendation for manufacturers or developers validating a molecular lab assay on an IVD versus an RUO instrument?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is open to the use of RUO instruments but prefers IVD instruments. The RUO instrument labeling must be reviewed to ensure compliance, though these are not comprehensive reviews. Authorizations depend on the data quality, and the FDA is flexible due to the limited supply of IVD instruments.

I believe our update to serology template has the latest in our thinking about devices that would be used to say scan the results from - right off the assays, at least up to our current thinking, relatively current now, to assist developers of these devices, to enter into the market. Of course these kind of devices could be very helpful in capturing electronically, the data so that it could potentially, more easily, be transmitted to public health authorities for tracking this pandemic in a more precise way and accurately. So obviously, we're supportive. So I don't believe we're currently planning to have a specific template for these devices, but look to the individual templates for each of the different technology, serology, antigen and molecular, for information about what we're looking for in those devices.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA suggests submitting a regular application for adding features to your SAMD product, as it likely wouldn't qualify for EUA. They continue to review most non-COVID applications, including 510ks, de novos, and PMAs, despite a focus on COVID-related work.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What would FDA recommend so we can get a software update added to our current SAMD product?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. So obviously diabetes is a risk factor for a severe COVID disease and for death. So it has an important relationship and I was invited to give a keynote talk a couple of weeks ago, at a national diabetes forum. And we talked about some of this interplay between diabetes and COVID and our desire to be of assistance. It would not likely qualify under an EUA provision as we understand it. So if you - the QSUB, pre-SUB process for non-COVID applications, is - promotes non-COVID applications is challenging. It sounds like you and your company are very expert at this. So if you're looking for an assessment about whether it's SAMD, software as a medical device, or doesn't support software applications, we can probably provide some input on that. But if you already know it's a software as a medical device update I would recommend if you know what to do and you feel comfortable about it, that you just go ahead and do the work and you submit it in the normal application. We do have the surge where we moved folks including from the diabetes branch, into COVID activities. We didn't move everybody. And we're still reviewing many, in fact most, non-COVID application submissions in the office. We're not talking about QSUBs or pre-SUBs. Most of those are being rapidly closed down. But actual 510ks, de novos, PMAs, we are still accepting and reviewing most of those. If COVID activities impact your submission you will be notified relatively quickly in written form what the potential impact is. The surge is a 90-day targeted surge and - but we're not looking at - we're not anticipating pulling back from the surge until the beginning of the new year and will obviously affect us on a frequent basis.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the appropriate procedure for submitting a non-COVID software update application if the QSUB process is being closed down?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends submitting non-COVID software updates through the normal application process (e.g., 510ks, de novos, PMAs), as QSUBs and pre-SUBs are being closed down. Most non-COVID applications are still being reviewed, and any COVID-related delays will be communicated in writing.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the appropriate procedure for submitting a non-COVID software update application if the QSUB process is being closed down?
VERBATIM ANSWER: If you already know it's a software as a medical device update I would recommend if you know what to do and you feel comfortable about it, that you just go ahead and do the work and you submit it in the normal application. We do have the surge where we moved folks including from the diabetes branch, into COVID activities. We didn't move everybody. And we're still reviewing many, in fact most, non-COVID application submissions in the office. We're not talking about QSUBs or pre-SUBs. Most of those are being rapidly closed down. But actual 510ks, de novos, PMAs, we are still accepting and reviewing most of those. If COVID activities impact your submission you will be notified relatively quickly in written form what the potential impact is.

QA Block 7-6
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What sample type limitations might affect the quality assessment of serology devices at NCI?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: NCI primarily uses serum and plasma for serology device assessment since handling sufficient whole blood and fingerstick samples is challenging. Devices may perform differently on these samples, and FDA leverages available serum or plasma to evaluate performance and make informed decisions.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What sample type limitations might affect the quality assessment of serology devices at NCI?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. So the, you know, it's going to be easiest for us to assess the quality of the devices on serum and plasma. There are some devices that may not work so well on one or the other of the sample types. In those situations we typically have enough serum or plasma samples in the panels, to independently assess performance. And we'll be as flexible as possible. But I'll just speak relatively frankly, we have denied and otherwise declined to issue so many serology tests that have failed at the NCI, that we are challenged to make the best decisions on these serology devices. So to the extent that we can assess them at NCI, for those that are amenable there, that's been at NCI that, and they passed, and obviously we've seen many of those, it makes our job more straightforward and easy to make decisions.

#### 8. Guidance for Developing OTC Home Antigen Tests

QA Block 8-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Do we have to have a comparator that provides CT values if our claim is going to be OTC use for this antigen test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends a high sensitivity molecular assay as a comparator for OTC antigen tests, not direct assays like Abbott ID NOW, which present challenges for approval.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Do we have to have a comparator that provides CT values if our claim is going to be OTC use for this antigen test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Comparator assays are extremely important. I encourage every developer to check in with us about our current thinking for a molecular comparator. What we're asking is a molecular comparator to be, is a high sensitivity molecular assay with an external or a separate can be all integrated extraction, concentrating extraction procedure.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Why is it important to test a full range of viral levels (including low positive samples) during authorization studies?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA requires a full range of viral levels, including about 20% low positive samples, to be tested during studies to ensure accurate performance. High positive samples alone can misrepresent assay effectiveness, as viral levels can be low in early symptomatic cases.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Why is it important to test a full range of viral levels (including low positive samples) during authorization studies?
VERBATIM ANSWER: However, when we make authorization decisions for - particularly for antigen and for molecular assays, we want to know that a full range of viral levels have been tested. And we have a target of, you know, these sort of in the range of about 20% low positive samples to be assessed. Because if someone comes in only with very high positive samples obviously that kind of rigs the system to say oh, you have a great assay. It doesn't really test the system. And we know that there - even in the first few days of symptomatology for those who have symptoms, that some of them measured in the sample at least, that's acquired, viral levels can be very low. CTs can be very high.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Is the use of commercially available sterile containers for COVID-19 saliva testing currently allowed without specific labeling for such use?
VERBATIM ANSWER: It would be important that a collection device not be marketed as a saliva collection device for COVID testing, without being authorized for that use. But if, you know, if your test is validated for use with a, you know, sort of generic, sterile container, excuse me, and you're not labeling that generic sterile container as a COVID-19 saliva collection device, then that's not an issue. We just would - if you are looking to market a collection device that is labeled for COVID testing and you're, you know, sending that out for testing, then that's something that we would want to see as a collection device. But there are some tests that are currently authorized that do use, you know, just a sterile - available sterile container commercially available. And that's definitely something that is useful because they are more readily available.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Do you anticipate serology tests transitioning from an RX device to an OTC device?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is open to having serology tests transition from prescription (RX) to over-the-counter (OTC) use. The agency is awaiting clearance on the home serology test template to proceed with determinations and cannot provide a specific timeline. They are sharing recommendations and expectations with developers.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Do you anticipate serology tests transitioning from an RX device to an OTC device?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So we are waiting for clearance on the home - I think this is correct, Toby. We don't have clearance on the home serology test template yet. We've obviously drafted it and it's going through the clearance process. We can't predict when it will be made publicly available, but we - to developers we are providing our current thinking on that. We're not sharing the draft template but we are sharing our current thinking on the question that are asked. So just like our first home molecular test and just like what will be for our first home antigen test and our first home serology test, whether it's RX or OTC, it's, you know, do we have sufficient information to make a good decision? And does that decision support authorization for the intended use? So we're absolutely open to OTC and I would anticipate in the not too distant future, we're going to start making some OTC determinations and some that will obviously become public. And so we're well on that path I believe. So I can't tell you when. If you're interested in it, we're open to it.
