And so generally, that FAQ makes clear that FDA does not plan to take any action that would leave the American public without the tests that they need, and it also explains the difference between the public health emergency determination, which does require renewal, and expires if it's not extended, and the EUA declaration, which is what gives FDA the authority to issue EUAs. And the EUA declaration is in effect until the HHS Secretary terminates it. It is not dependent upon extension of the public health emergency declaration. So check out that FAQ and be assured that we will give notice if the EUA pathway is going to end.

#### 7. Analyzing Low Positives in Antigen Test Performance

QA Block 7-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How and when is performance data analysis with varying percentages of low positives appropriate?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends submitting data collected from clinical studies with confirmed omicron samples if they exceed 20% low positives. They provide methods to calculate performance within the 10–20% range and advise using pre-EUA to discuss study designs and comparator methods for ongoing validations.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How and when is performance data analysis with varying percentages of low positives appropriate?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Data from recent prospective clinical studies with the omicron variant have shown unusually high rates of low viral load samples. Typically we've seen 10 to 20% low positive for all previous variants. This one, which may in fact be linked to omicron, we're seeing the low positives range from about 30 to 40% with obviously poorer performance with those low positive samples versus higher positive samples. Our current performance targets are based on a target of 10 to 20% low positives in the clinical study. For data sets that have more than 20% low positives, we have additional recommendations that can be used to calculate performance within the 10 to 20% target range. There are caveats to this approach, and so far it has only been used for tests evaluated by the NIH's Independent Test Assessment Program, which utilizes study designs developed in collaboration with the FDA, as well as a calibrated RT‐PCR reference method. If you have completed a current clinical validation study with confirmed omicron positive samples, and have collected more than 20% low positives in your prospective study, then please submit all of your data, including all the low positives, and we can work with you on this new analysis approach. If you have not yet completed your clinical validation and are planning your approach, we recommend that you submit a pre‐EUA if you would like to discuss your study design, including the percent low positives and the comparator method.

#### 8. Guidance on Prospective Flu Sample Collection for Antigen Tests

QA Block 8-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is it still the case that for a multiplex OTC COVID-19 plus flu A and flu B test we can use banked samples for clinical studies if prospective samples cannot be found within two weeks?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA encourages the use of prospective samples for antigen tests as they are designed for freshly collected swabs. While frozen direct swabs not in VTM or saline may be used if available, these are rare. If finding flu patients is challenging, obtaining samples from the southern hemisphere could be an option. The FDA aims to remain flexible during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic while ensuring test accuracy.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is it still the case that for a multiplex OTC COVID-19 plus flu A and flu B test we can use banked samples for clinical studies if prospective samples cannot be found within two weeks?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Well, we do want you to get prospective samples for‐‐ you know, to see a product that's an antigen test. And the tests are designed for freshly collected direct swabs in general, and not some other sample type. If there are banks of frozen direct swabs you can access, that would be not in VTM, which is going to be‐‐ or saline, which is going to be rare, if ever. Because that's not how they usually are held. But if you are having trouble enrolling flu patients like in the U.S. right now. I mean, we're seeing flu A. It's not tremendously high, but it is present. But we're seeing almost no flu B. And so I got a question earlier today from somebody and they asked if they could go to the southern hemisphere. And I think we're going to be open to that as well to get those prospectively collected samples that are the sample type that's going to be used in the test. I'd also like to make the point that we're not in a flu pandemic. We're in a SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic. And we're trying to be as flexible as possible under the EUA statute for a multi‐analyte tests, but we're still laser‐focused on making sure that we can authorize accurate SARS‐CoV‐2 tests.

#### 10. FDA Pathway for Antigen 510(k) Submissions Explained

QA Block 10-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is there any plan for the FDA to open the pathway for antigen OTC tests for 510k?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is accepting full marketing authorization submissions for antigen tests, but the first authorization will likely be through a de novo process. The FDA will write special controls and reclassify the test to make subsequent 510k submissions possible.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is there any plan for the FDA to open the pathway for antigen OTC tests for 510k?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, we are accepting full marketing authorization submissions for antigen. However, the first one is likely to have to be a de novo since we will write special controls and down classify it to class II so that subsequent submissions would be 510k. So the first authorized product for antigen in all likelihood will be a de novo grant. Then after that, 510k.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends submitting a pre-submission (Q-Sub) to address specific questions about 510k submissions for antigen tests. Once the first antigen test is authorized as a de novo, it will be publicly announced and serve as the predicate for 510k submissions.
VERBATIM QUESTION: When could I get the information that the 510k submission pathway for antigen tests is open?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The best way to handle it is to submit a pre‐sub or a Q‐Sub‐‐ a pre‐submission, Q‐ submission to the FDA for your product‐‐ for your antigen test product‐‐ and ask any questions in that pre‐sub that you want to ask. And I would also add that it's not a matter of opening the pathway for 510ks. It's a matter of having that first de novo be granted. So if you're not interested in submitting a De novo, and you want to wait until that first antigen test is already granted, then once the first antigen test is authorized under a de novo, that will be announced publicly. That will be posted, and then that will be the available legal predicate for a 510k for an antigen COVID test.

#### 17. CLIA Complexity Categories for Point-of-Care Antigen Tests

QA Block 17-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the difference between a point-of-care antigen test authorized for use in moderate or high complexity CLIA-waived laboratories and one approved under moderate, high, or waived complexities?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA categorizes point-of-care antigen tests based on complexity, with high complexity tests requiring highly skilled technologists, moderate complexity tests utilized by medical technicians, and waived complexity tests designed for simple use by non-laboratory trained individuals like healthcare workers. Waived tests are typically suited for point-of-care or OTC settings with strict simplicity requirements.
VERBATIM QUESTION: For a point‐of‐care antigen test, what is the difference between a test that is authorized for use under moderate or high complexity CLIA‐waived laboratories versus one that is approved under moderate, high, or waived complexities?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah. So I mean‐‐ our office performs the CLIA categorization for non‐EUA, full authorization submissions. And there are suitable workflows for each of those environments. The most complicated workflows can obviously be performed in the high complexity with highly skilled and trained technologists. A moderate complexity, typically those who do not have training in, say, molecular biology but are perhaps more akin to a traditional med tech. And then CLIA‐waived deemed status for use in most of the point‐of‐care settings. But there can be point‐of‐care that use moderate complexity tests as well. It all depends on the staffing of the certificate lab. But in the CLIA certificate lab, those are non‐laboratory trained individuals‐‐ health care workers typically. So the test needs to be extremely simple. If you look on the FDA website, if you look at the tests that have a W by them for Waived, or any of the OTC tests, you'll see the level of simplicity that we're looking for in a test to be used in those settings.

TOPICS: reviewer assignment timeframe, Q-submissions process, follow-up for delays
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 19-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can we still schedule meetings regarding Q-subs or pre-subs, or is email the preferred method of communication?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA is reviewing Q-subs and pre-subs for COVID, but review times are extended due to high volume. Meetings are reserved for cases where email is insufficient, as email is the preferred method to optimize efficiency given resource limitations.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can we still schedule meetings regarding Q-subs or pre-subs, or is email the preferred method of communication?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So our current status is that we are not accepting all pre‐subs and Q‐subs across the board, except for categories that we've previously announced. But that includes pre‐subs/Q‐subs for COVID. So we are reviewing them. Our first goal overall is to get back to reviewing all pre‐subs and Q‐subs. But because we're not doing them all yet, and because of the volume of submissions that are continuing for COVID, our review times for pre‐subs and Q‐subs are extended. And I can't give you a firm time period. But if you've submitted it, you should be assigned a reviewer. That reviewer will do an assessment and should let you know when they think they can get back to you, and then keep you updated. And that should be happening. And then as far as meetings go, if‐‐ meetings take a lot of time. And since we're so busy, we are trying to handle as much work through email as possible, and reserving meetings for those times when email is not suitable to get the work done, so that we're getting to as many applications as possible, as soon as possible, given our time and resource limitations.

#### 20. EUA Transition Timeline and Technology-Specific Considerations

QA Block 20-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the FDA plan to stop accepting EUA submissions in July during the EUA to 510k transition?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA has not set a July deadline for stopping EUA submissions, and the rumor about closing EUAs on July 1st is untrue. The EUA emergency declaration is still active, and FDA will provide advance notice of any changes.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA plan to stop accepting EUA submissions in July during the EUA to 510k transition?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah, thanks. So I did mention earlier on the call during one of the prepared questions that we received ahead of time‐‐ the question was about whether the COVID EUA pathway would be ending soon. I think you mentioned something about July. And the original question we received also was noting that they had heard a rumor that the COVID EUAs would be closing on July 1st. As I mentioned earlier, that is just a rumor. As Tim said, we've issued a draft guidance about the transition. After the comments are considered for that, then a final guidance will be issued that will lay out a timeline for transition. And that all, as I mentioned earlier, is also related to the EUA emergency declaration, which is still active. We are still accepting EUAs. And we will ‐‐ [CLEARS THROAT] ‐‐ excuse me. We will provide advance notice if and when any of that is changing. But that said, as Tim has also mentioned, we do encourage developers to work on their transition to a full authorization.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Will the FDA handle the EUA transition to 510k in the same manner for all assay technologies such as molecular, antigen, combo tests, and breath tests, or will there be a different schedule for different technologies?
VERBATIM ANSWER: But we're going to be transitioning all the assay technologies at the same time when that time comes. We've only put out draft on transition guidance, and that draft guidance needs to go through finalization and published as a final before we even consider moving towards the transition process. And then there isn't a set time to make that—first of all we can't predict when that final guidance will come out. And therefore we can't even contemplate when a transition might occur. We do know it is going to occur, and there will be a transition timeline that should allow developers to come in with an application. And if they're in by the deadline, then they can stay on the market while the FDA reviews those applications.
