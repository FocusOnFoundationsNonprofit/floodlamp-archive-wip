QA Block 4-7
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What challenges might developers face when the EUA comes to an end, particularly regarding the use of RUO components?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Developers should anticipate challenges after the EUA ends, such as the potential need for full submissions (e.g., de novo, 510K) for RUO instrumentation. FDA advises engaging with them to understand post-emergency pathways.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What challenges might developers face when the EUA comes to an end, particularly regarding the use of RUO components?
VERBATIM ANSWER: I would add though that there may be challenges once the EUA might come to an end. I don't expect that the emergency declaration will end anytime soon. However there is a provision in the EUA statues and regs that allows for specific technologies once they come through for a full authorization, normal authorization whether that's usually their de novo first and a 510K that there is an option for that particular type of device to be removed from the emergency declaration and require full submission. So as developers are developing this they should keep that in mind with regard to research use instrumentation but there may be a limit beyond an emergency in which they could use that other than labs that validate RUOs. They are potential pathways, it's just that it's good to talk to the FDA about those pathways ahead of time and be prepared for them.

#### 5. CLIA Classification and Usage of Serology Tests

QA Block 5-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can serology tests be used in labs with moderate complexity and a certificate under FDA guidance?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA classifies all diagnostic tests as high complexity by default, unless authorized through the EUA process as moderately complex or CLIA-waived. While it's not intended to limit use to high-complexity labs, current regulations require this unless specific EUA authorization is granted. Developers can pursue EUA for CLIA-waived designation or participate in voluntary interagency verification programs.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can serology tests be used in labs with moderate complexity and a certificate under FDA guidance?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, that's a great question and it's a challenging question and a challenging answer. So under the EUA authorizations we are not making CLIA class CLIA classifications as far as high, moderate or waived. And also if we do not authorize through the EUA process a test we cannot deem something to be CLIA waived which is an alternate pathway under the EUA provision. So all tests are typically thought to be or assumed to be high complexity tests unless through the EUA authorization process we deem them as moderately complex or waived. This deeming is only something that's allowed under regs and statutes for tests that are authorized by the FDA. And so certainly it was not our intention to limit the use of these serology rapid serology tests that are otherwise designed to be used in a point-of-care setting. However because of the limits that we have in law it is the opinion of CMS that these can be performed in high complexity labs. If a developer wishes to come through a full EUA authorization process with their point-of-care test that is always a pathway open and at that point if the test is appropriate for a patient or a point-of-care setting we can deem that test to be that category and make that clear in the labeling and that then allows the device to be used in a near patient point-of-care setting. We are looking at potential alternate pathways to achieve the same end. I mentioned that we have an interagency effort to verify performance of these tests. We may have a pathway open through that that we're looking at. And we encourage all serology point-of-care developers to participate. It's a voluntary program but that would be most helpful I think to everyone.

For home-based serology tests, EUA authorization is required, with considerations for usability, result interpretation, and patient safety. FDA is open to telehealth, including video links, to aid in test use and result interpretation.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If we use serology tests at an appropriate site, will we be able to use telehealth for the physician consultation?
VERBATIM ANSWER: As far as telehealth or alternate sites or home use if something is within - is deemed as CLIA waived because it has been authorized by the FDA and it can be used therefore in a CLIA waived setting it that setting is going to be staffed by health care folks who are able to perform that testing. Usually telehealth would be used in more of the home situation and those as we stated before require EUA authorization for a home-based test. We are very open to a home-based serology test. The important factors are, you know, how easy for this a patient, untrained patient to perform the testing? How easy is it to them to read the test results and how easy is it for them to interpret those results? Now for a typical rapid serology test there's questions in each of those places and also we do look at safety.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the specific requirements for a home-based serology test to gain EUA authorization?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is open to authorizing home-based serology tests, but the key requirements include ease of use for untrained patients, readability of test results, interpretation accuracy, and overall safety.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the specific requirements for a home-based serology test to gain EUA authorization?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We are very open to a home-based serology test. The important factors are, you know, how easy for this a patient, untrained patient to perform the testing? How easy is it to them to read the test results and how easy is it for them to interpret those results? Now for a typical rapid serology test there's questions in each of those places and also we do look at safety.
