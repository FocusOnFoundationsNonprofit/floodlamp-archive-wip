#### 1. FDA Guidance on Laboratory Modifications to Authorized COVID-19 Tests

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Would a premarket submission for over-the-counter COVID-19 tests be submitted as a 510(k), or would this be a de novo?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA expects the first over-the-counter COVID-19 test submission to be a de novo, with subsequent similar tests submitted as 510(k)s.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Would a premarket submission for over-the-counter COVID-19 tests be submitted as a 510(k), or would this be a de novo?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So we've not yet granted a full authorization for an over-the-counter COVID-19 test. So the first one we would likely expect to be submitted as a de novo, and then once we offer as the first de novo, subsequent similar tests would be 510ks.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Joseph Tartal (FDA)
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: Over-the-counter COVID-19 tests, Premarket submission process
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can FDA clarify whether modifications made by a laboratory to an emergency use authorized COVID-19 diagnostic test prior to November 15, 2021, to add new specimen types can continue to be used without FDA authorization?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA allows laboratories to continue using modifications made to an EUA COVID-19 diagnostic test to add new specimen types before November 15, 2021, without further authorization if the new specimen type was previously authorized for a similar technology and properly validated.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can FDA clarify whether modifications made by a laboratory to an emergency use authorized COVID-19 diagnostic test prior to November 15, 2021, to add new specimen types can continue to be used without FDA authorization?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, as long as the specimen type is one that has been previously authorized for another test for the same technology. This is discussed in Section 4D2 of the updated guidance. And it notes that for modifications made as discussed in previous versions of the guidance, prior to authorized COVID-19 diagnostic test for use with a new specimen type, where the new specimen type has been previously authorized for another test of the same technology, and where the lab has validated the test for the new specimen type, FDA does not intend to object to the continued use-­ that's continued now after the November 15 guidance-- of such a modified test without notification to FDA or a new or amended EUA.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Joseph Tartal (FDA)
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: Laboratory test modifications, Specimen type validation, FDA EUA guidance
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the process for submitting validation data for laboratories developing an LDT and needing EUA authorization?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The process involves submitting a copy, scanned or photocopied, of the CLIA validation records along with a cover letter. These documents should be sent electronically to the FDA templates email box.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the process for submitting validation data for laboratories developing an LDT and needing EUA authorization?
VERBATIM ANSWER: I want to make sure that labs know - LDT developers know - just how easy it is to submit their validation data. It can simply be a copy, a scanned copy, a photocopy of their CLIA validation records. That can be your submission. Make that copy. Send it electronically to us at the template box along with a cover letter that says what we're doing. It's as easy as that. There should be really no problem with doing that for all the CLIA-validated tests out there that want to stay on the market.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Validation submission process, EUA authorization for LDTs
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-5
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the FDA require a specific test volume threshold for LDTs seeking EUA authorization?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA does not require a test volume threshold for LDTs validated before November 15, 2021. Both low-volume and high-volume labs are acceptable without volume metric recommendations.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA require a specific test volume threshold for LDTs seeking EUA authorization?
VERBATIM ANSWER: There is no test volume requirement for LDTs that are in this category. So those that have been validated prior to November 15, 2021, there is no volume metric recommendation. Small labs with low- volume tests, they're fine just as well as large labs with high-volume tests. We did this in an effort to not decrease test availability and to allow all the LDTs that have been developed and launched and validated and launched in the US as of that date, which was a long time to take to develop a test.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: test volume thresholds, LDT EUA authorization, COVID-19 diagnostics
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-6
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the acceptable methods for validating diagnostic tests for Omicron-specific performance on antigen tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends validating Omicron performance on antigen tests using live patient samples, including banked samples in saline, to confirm test performance. A new clinical study is not required.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the acceptable methods for validating diagnostic tests for Omicron-specific performance on antigen tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Testing with actual live patient samples, even if banked as long as they're probably in saline, is an option to actually including omicron patients in your clinical study. We're not asking you to do a new clinical study. We just want to know, is the test performing on omicron samples? And there are multiple ways to get to that end.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Diagnostic test validation, Omicron-specific performance, Antigen tests
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-7
CLARIFIED QUESTION: For new submissions involving omicron, what types of clinical data are recommended by the FDA to demonstrate test performance?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends providing clinical data showing test performance on omicron samples, which may include testing with live or banked patient samples. A new clinical study is not required if existing samples can demonstrate performance.
VERBATIM QUESTION: For new submissions involving omicron, what types of clinical data are recommended by the FDA to demonstrate test performance?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Any new EUA requests for antigen tests, we're recommending clinical data with omicron. This can be encompassed within the present policies or covered under the present policies for variant detection. We know that omicron is widespread right now. And if your validation was done before omicron, we really need to know how it performs with omicron, because there is the potential for a decrease in clinical sensitivity. There have been numerous preprints and anecdotal reports showing a potential loss of sensitivity here. The FDA has NIH RADx data that's suggestive of that as well. So in order to speed your process to get this data, please reach out to your FDA reviewer for ways that you can address this as soon as possible. Testing with actual live patient samples, even if banked as long as they're probably in saline, is an option to actually including omicron patients in your clinical study. We're not asking you to do a new clinical study. We just want to know, is the test performing on omicron samples? And there are multiple ways to get to that end.

REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-8
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How does the FDA view the use of oropharyngeal or throat swabs in authorized diagnostic tests, especially those used by consumers at home?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA advises the use of COVID-19 tests strictly as authorized, following the specified sample collection methods. Home antigen tests are only authorized for nasal swabs. While FDA has received unsuccessful saliva submissions and lacks data on throat swabs for at-home use, they are open to receiving more data. Saliva, throat swabs, and other oral specimens differ and may not perform equally well.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How does the FDA view the use of oropharyngeal or throat swabs in authorized diagnostic tests, especially those used by consumers at home?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Now moving to the next topic, there has been a lot of interest in the preprint data showing that saliva and/or other oral swabs or even oropharyngeal swabs may provide earlier detection of omicron than a nasal swab. And there has been discussion of use of, say, throat swabs, otherwise known as oropharyngeal swabs, for OTC tests and other tests, frankly, for which they have not been validated for. The FDA does advise that COVID-19 tests should be used as authorized, including following their instructions for use regarding obtaining the sample for testing. The home antigen tests available today are only authorized for nasal swabs. We have received some saliva submissions. So far, they've been unsuccessful due to performance issues. We do not have any data yet suggesting throat swabs are inaccurate or appropriate method for at-home tests. But we're open to receiving submissions. Of note, that saliva and throat swabs and other swabs within the oral cavity are different types of specimens. And they may not perform equally well. So just because something works, say, for oropharyngeal doesn't mean it will work for saliva or any other sample type within the oropharynx.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Oropharyngeal swabs, At-home testing, FDA guidelines
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-9
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What kind of data should accompany submissions involving saliva or throat swabs to demonstrate their effectiveness as sample types for COVID-19 tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA advises that tests be used as authorized, but is open to submissions to evaluate saliva or throat swabs. Saliva submissions have faced performance issues, and throat swab data is lacking. FDA stresses that specimen types perform differently, and validation data is crucial.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What kind of data should accompany submissions involving saliva or throat swabs to demonstrate their effectiveness as sample types for COVID-19 tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The FDA does advise that COVID-19 tests should be used as authorized, including following their instructions for use regarding obtaining the sample for testing. The home antigen tests available today are only authorized for nasal swabs. We have received some saliva submissions. So far, they've been unsuccessful due to performance issues. We do not have any data yet suggesting throat swabs are inaccurate or appropriate method for at-home tests. But we're open to receiving submissions. Of note, that saliva and throat swabs and other swabs within the oral cavity are different types of specimens. And they may not perform equally well. So just because something works, say, for oropharyngeal doesn't mean it will work for saliva or any other sample type within the oropharynx. So we have authorized many molecular tests for saliva. But we've also seen some poor performance from molecular tests. And then, as I mentioned, antigen tests so far, we've looked at some that have been unsuccessful with saliva as a sample type for reasons unknown and could be worked out. And obviously, we're interested in that saliva as a sample type even for antigen tests if the issues can be worked out. The FDA has authorized OP swabs for some molecular tests but has not authorized them, as I said, for antigen tests. A check of our records, in fact, indicates that we're not aware of any oropharyngeal submissions or throat swab submissions for antigen tests, which the FDA, as I stated, is open to receiving.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Saliva and throat swab data, COVID-19 test validation, FDA submission guidance
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-10
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are there recommended safety measures or data points to address potential risks associated with throat swab self-collection?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA has noted concerns about self-collection of throat swabs due to their complexity and potential risks, such as false results, mechanical injuries, aspiration risks, and equipment not designed for such use. The CDC recommends that throat swabs be collected by trained healthcare providers.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are there recommended safety measures or data points to address potential risks associated with throat swab self-collection?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The FDA has also noted concerns regarding self-collection of throat swabs, as they have been-- they are more complicated than nasal swab. Nasal swabs were ideal in many ways for home collection, unsupervised self-collection and, in some cases, even in some kids and, if used incorrectly, can cause harm to the patient. Some potential safety concerns may include risk of false negative, false positive results for tests that were not developed or validated for use with oropharyngeal specimens. And then, of course, oropharyngeal and/or saliva or other oral samples types may work better or worse for different variant types. There is evidence that OP swabs or saliva may have been worse for, say, delta than for nasal swab. So a performance may change. And having more options is great. We just like to see some data, including that it's an accurate way to do it and that it's safe. So mechanical injuries to the tonsils or throat from the swab, there are. Obvious patient preference is for nasal swab over getting a throat swab. Throat swabs frequently induce gagging or vomiting, which can lead to an aspiration of gastric contents or oral contents into the lungs, which could cause a pneumonia, which could complicate obviously a SARS-CoV-2 infection or other underlying lung diseases. And pieces as well could break off. They're more fragile. The current swabs aren't necessarily designed for throat swabbing. Some of them may be too short for this. And, of course, the CDC does recommend that throat swabs be collected by a trained health care provider.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Safety of throat swab collection, Self-collection risks, Recommendations for healthcare providers
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-11
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can a genotyping test for SARS-CoV-2 variants meet diagnostic validation requirements by incorporating data from archived samples or genomic sequencing?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends validating genotyping tests using archived clinical samples or inactivated virus within the clinical matrix, with sequencing-based assays serving as the best comparator to establish the accuracy of the genotyping results.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can a genotyping test for SARS-CoV-2 variants meet diagnostic validation requirements by incorporating data from archived samples or genomic sequencing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We will likely recommend establishing a performance of the genotyping test with either archives, clinical samples or inactivated virus within the clinical matrix. And, of course, a sequencing-based assay is probably the best comparator here if it's a good sequencing assay for establishing the, quote, "truth" of the genotyping result.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Genotyping tests, Validation requirements, Archived samples
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-12
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What validation plans are recommended for developers implementing a genotyping claim in sequencing-based assays?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends submitting a pre-EUA with a detailed intended use statement and validation plans for sequencing-based genotyping claims. It advises including a diagnostic test to mitigate risks of false results, using clinical validation data for performance assessment, and considering a change protocol for easier updates.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What validation plans are recommended for developers implementing a genotyping claim in sequencing-based assays?
VERBATIM ANSWER: As discussed in our February 2021 guidance on mutations, FDA believes that whole genome sequencing tests may be best suited for genotyping claims due to their ability to detect both known and emerging mutations and variants or otherwise unknown mutations, unknown variants that may come along. If you wish to pursue a genotyping claim, a detailed discussion of your validation proposal is best addressed within the context of a pre-EUA. We recommend that you submit a pre-EUA with a detailed intended use statement and validation plans for establishing performance for all mutations you find and detect. Please note that we've recommended including a diagnostic test in your genotyping test so that risk of false result with the genotyping test can be mitigated. Your genotyping test could be a reflex off of an EUA-authorized test. Or the diagnostic test can be incorporated into detection plus-minus of SARS-CoV-2 can be incorporated into your genotyping test. Without a diagnostic test performed in parallel with your genotyping test, the risk to patient, due to false results, is significant. That makes sense. Typically, this type of significant risk is mitigated by providing data from a clinical validation study using samples from patients infected with virus harboring the mutation of interest with the diagnostic test performed in parallel. The risk to patients is reduced. And therefore, we will likely recommend establishing a performance of the genotyping test with either archives, clinical samples or inactivated virus within the clinical matrix. And, of course, a sequencing-based assay is probably the best comparator here if it's a good sequencing assay for establishing the, quote, "truth" of the genotyping result. Please strongly consider, with any sort of genotyping protocol, whether it be whole genome sequencing and/or a non-sequencing-based genotyping or a limited genotyping sequencing assay, whatever, submitting a change protocol with a request with your submission so that you can more easily and quickly update your assay without FDA review prior to launching that update as long as the pre- authorized conditions for that change protocol are met.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: genotyping claims, validation plans, whole genome sequencing
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-13
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What criteria must be satisfied to make pre-authorized updates in genotyping test protocols without FDA pre-review?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Genotyping test developers can make updates without FDA pre-review if they submit a change protocol with their initial submission and meet pre-authorized conditions, sharing validation data with the FDA after implementation.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What criteria must be satisfied to make pre-authorized updates in genotyping test protocols without FDA pre-review?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Please strongly consider, with any sort of genotyping protocol, whether it be whole genome sequencing and/or a non-sequencing-based genotyping or a limited genotyping sequencing assay, whatever, submitting a change protocol with a request with your submission so that you can more easily and quickly update your assay without FDA review prior to launching that update as long as the pre-authorized conditions for that change protocol are met. We, of course, are likely to want to see that data, review it in case there's any issues. But again, if you follow the pre-authorized change protocol, with the output conditions are met, you just go ahead and make that change, launch it, letting us know and showing us the validation data. You don't have to wait on the FDA to review.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Genotyping test updates, FDA pre-review conditions
REVIEW FLAG: False


#### 2. FDA Policy on Laboratory-Test Modifications and EUA Requirements

QA Block 2-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are FDA's expectations for EUA submissions when a modification changes the indication for use of a test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA expects a new or amended EUA to be issued before offering tests with modifications that change the indication for use, such as adding a new specimen type, a new patient population, or altering analyte-specific reagents.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are FDA's expectations for EUA submissions when a modification changes the indication for use of a test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: And then changes to the indication for use such as adding a new specimen type or a new patient population, such as asymptomatic individuals, would not fall under the modifications policy and FDA would expect a new or amended EUA be issued prior to such a test being offered. Further changes to the PCR primers or probes, for example, would not fall under this policy since that would involve changing the analyte-specific reagents. And FDA similarly, would expect a new or amended EUA be issued prior to such a test being offered.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends including both symptomatic and asymptomatic data for over-the-counter tests, separately and combined. At least 20 symptomatic and 10 asymptomatic individuals should be included. Asymptomatic individuals should be symptom-free for at least 2 weeks or 2 weeks post-positive test. Those suspected of COVID-19 should be excluded as asymptomatic. FDA requires screening and documentation of patient status, and full data on exposures, symptoms, and days since onset for symptomatic individuals. Performance data should be stratified accordingly.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can FDA clarify the clinical study patient enrollment recommendations to support an over-the-counter test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah, so we recommend that you present the symptomatic and asymptomatic data for over-the-counter tests both separately and combined. We generally would expect at least 20 symptomatic individuals, and 10 asymptomatic individuals at the time of authorization. And this is discussed in the antigen and molecular home-use template. There's also information in both the molecular and antigen diagnostic test templates about the definition of asymptomatic individuals, which generally would be someone who's free of symptoms for at least two weeks prior to enrollment and testing. Or if they've previously tested positive, at least two weeks from the time of the last positive test prior to enrollment and testing. And we also would generally expect asymptomatic individuals who are suspected of COVID-19 such as with a known exposure be excluded from consideration as an asymptomatic individual for this context. And then as part of the clinical study protocol and data, we would like to see documentation of how you screened and confirmed that all enrolled individuals were asymptomatic and consistent with your proposed intended use. So in the EUA request, we'd like to see all of the elements of the clinical study provided including known exposures, symptoms, and days since symptom onset for each symptomatic individual included in the clinical validation study. And then we recommend that you stratify the performance data for symptomatic only, asymptomatic only, and then an overall combined analysis.

#### 8. Saliva vs. NP Swabs: Validity as PCR Comparator

QA Block 8-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Would the FDA consider saliva as a comparator test for COVID-19 diagnostics?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA continues to consider the NP swab the gold standard for respiratory virus diagnostics, including COVID-19, despite its challenges during the pandemic. Saliva tests have shown issues in molecular diagnostics, so NP swabs remain the comparator sample type. However, discordant analyses involving saliva can be considered with proper study design and through discussion in a Pre-EUA submission.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Would the FDA consider saliva as a comparator test for COVID-19 diagnostics?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Thanks, Wenli. Yes, I understand your question, and I understand your concern. For respiratory viruses, I think most people still recognize the NP swab as the gold standard. It has been problematic to use in this pandemic when people need to be tested so often, but for validating a new test, it does remain the gold standard. And we have seen issues with saliva for molecular tests. So that will still be the comparator sample type. You did bring up what can you do if you have discordance, particularly if the antigen test is positive and the NP swap should be negative. Those discordances can happen both directions. And there are ways to do discordant analysis up front on every sample, which can-- by using the right comparative battery of tests in order to adjudicate any discordances, if the proper concordant analysis testing is done on every sample in an unbiased fashion. That can be used to inform your PPA or NPA. Otherwise, if it's more focused on just the discordant samples done properly as well, we have the ability to annotate the 2 by 2 tables that list your performance characteristics, i.e., if the antigen test has what looks like false positives, compared to the NP swab, but you have a saliva test that is confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2, that can be a component of discordant analysis that can be placed into your instructions for use. So that is the way that we've been handling these kind of potential discordances for a long time, not just under this pandemic. It is a tried and true method of examining this in an unbiased way. So with this concern, I would discuss it with your primary reviewer, or if you are going to submit a Pre-EUA, ask it in the Pre-EUA submission, along with your study design and your discordant resolution design.

Such findings can be incorporated into performance data and instructions for use, subject to proper concordant or discordant resolution methodology.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can a saliva test confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 positive be used as evidence to address discordances observed with NP swabs?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, I understand your question, and I understand your concern. For respiratory viruses, I think most people still recognize the NP swab as the gold standard. It has been problematic to use in this pandemic when people need to be tested so often, but for validating a new test, it does remain the gold standard. And we have seen issues with saliva for molecular tests. So that will still be the comparator sample type. You did bring up what can you do if you have discordance, particularly if the antigen test is positive and the NP swap should be negative. Those discordances can happen both directions. And there are ways to do discordant analysis up front on every sample, which can-- by using the right comparative battery of tests in order to adjudicate any discordances, if the proper concordant analysis testing is done on every sample in an unbiased fashion. That can be used to inform your PPA or NPA. Otherwise, if it's more focused on just the discordant samples done properly as well, we have the ability to annotate the 2 by 2 tables that list your performance characteristics, i.e., if the antigen test has what looks like false positives, compared to the NP swab, but you have a saliva test that is confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2, that can be a component of discordant analysis that can be placed into your instructions for use. So that is the way that we've been handling these kind of potential discordances for a long time, not just under this pandemic. It is a tried and true method of examining this in an unbiased way. So with this concern, I would discuss it with your primary reviewer, or if you are going to submit a Pre-EUA, ask it in the Pre-EUA submission, along with your study design and your discordant resolution design.

#### 11. FDA Prioritization of Quantitative and Neutralizing Antibody Tests

QA Block 11-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is the FDA not planning to review any lab-based high volume, high throughput, high capacity, qualitative serology tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA prioritizes tests that can quantitate antibody levels or detect neutralizing antibodies, as these are important for assessing correlates of immunity and linking results to standardized units. Fully qualitative tests are not the current focus.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is the FDA not planning to review any lab-based high volume, high throughput, high capacity, qualitative serology tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: At this point, the priority is for high volume point-of-care or central lab tests that can quantitate the level of antibody or detect neutralizing antibody. As the science has developed here on serology, we feel that if there's going to be an expansion of use of serology, it's going to depend on whether you can have an assay that detects neutralizing antibody. Or can fully quantitate, so that if there is an immune correlate that we can put it into international units. Because many of the studies that are ongoing are not using an EUA authorized tests or in this manner that are fully quantitative. So we need to have a way to link those study results to assays without requiring the assays to go ahead and do the big clinical validation for correlates to immunity. So this is how we're trying to be least burdensome in applying any known correlates of immunity to serology tests.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA incorporates NIH omicron data into labeling differently for tests that are pre-authorization by working with RADx to include the data, while also updating labels for authorized tests. Developers can request expedited updates.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does pre-authorization status of a test affect how FDA incorporates NIH omicron data into the labeling?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So if the NIH has done their omicron testing on an antigen test, either an EUA authorized test or one that's going through one of the RADx or ITAP process, if it's pre-authorization we're working with RADx to put that into the labeling that we did for Siemens. But we will go through the antigen tests and update those labels. So if a particular developer, you, wants to come in and speed up that label update showing that you are detecting omicron, I think that's an important element due to the question about omicron performance. And we want to work with you on that. So if you have NIH data you can just make that request in a supplement, and we will work with you to get the IFU updated.
