#### 1. FDA Webinar on COVID-19 Test Guidance Updates

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the pooling and serial testing amendment only apply to RT-PCRs or can other types of nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) also fall under this amendment?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The pooling and serial testing amendment specifically applies to previously authorized molecular RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests that meet all criteria in the amendment. Other NAATs may qualify if they submit an individual supplemental EUA request. Validation approaches outlined in the amendment may be used depending on test technology.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the pooling and serial testing amendment only apply to RT-PCRs or can other types of nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) also fall under this amendment?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The amendment is specific to previously authorized molecular-based RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests that are - that meet all of the criteria outlined in the amendment. This is based on the experience we've had with SARS-CoV-2 tests over the past year and our experience with data that demonstrates that tests within the scope of the amendment are likely to maintain appropriate performance when they add pooling. Other types of NAATs may be able to add the same indication but we would expect an individual supplemental EUA request to add the same pooled serial screening indications. The validation approaches that are outlined in the appendices of the amendment may be applicable depending on the technology. But you would have to take a look and see whether those validation approaches would work for your test. For example, there are, you know, some of the validation approaches require the use of CT scores and some tests don't return CT scores. So there are two validation options for media pooling. Option 2, I believe it is, does not rely on CT scores so that would likely be the applicable validation option for a test that does not use CT scores.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: Pooling and serial testing amendment, RT-PCR applicability, Supplemental EUA for NAATs
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are the validation approaches outlined in the appendices of the amendment applicable to other types of NAATs depending on the technology?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The validation approaches in the amendment may apply to other NAATs depending on the technology, but specific tests must assess applicability. Some approaches use CT scores, but Option 2 for media pooling does not, making it suitable for tests without CT scores.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are the validation approaches outlined in the appendices of the amendment applicable to other types of NAATs depending on the technology?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The validation approaches that are outlined in the appendices of the amendment may be applicable depending on the technology.

QA Block 1-5
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What does Condition F in the recent pooling and serial testing amendment entail regarding post-authorization studies?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Condition F pertains to the screening aspect of the test's indication. Pooling must be validated beforehand and submitted as part of the request. The post-authorization studies emphasize validation with asymptomatic individuals, aligned with the serial screening supplemental template.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What does Condition F in the recent pooling and serial testing amendment entail regarding post-authorization studies?
VERBATIM ANSWER: That commitment or that condition is specific to the screening aspect of the indication. So the pooling aspect we do expect to be validated ahead of time as outlined in the amendment. And those - that validation should be submitted as part of your request to be added to the exhibit. The post-authorization condition lines up with the approach that we outlined in the serial screening supplemental template that we posted last month. March 16th I believe. That provided a path for authorization of screening claims prior to validation with asymptomatic individuals. So under this amendment we've rolled that in so that if a test did not previously have screening claims the amendment will give that test the serial screening claims and the post-authorization condition requires that validation with asymptomatic individuals. So we wanted to clarify that.

#### 12. Clinical Utility of Companion Diagnostics for Variant Identification

QA Block 12-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Will there be any clinical utility for a companion diagnostic test to identify the KLA variant or specific mutations involved with a positive specimen?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA is in discussions with test developers for sequencing-based and genotyping-based assays to detect variants and their clinical utility. They provide validation guidance for developers and distinguish between public health reporting and clinical reporting of genotypic results. Correlations to therapeutics or vaccines require further studies.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Will there be any clinical utility for a companion diagnostic test to identify the KLA variant or specific mutations involved with a positive specimen?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. So right now we are in discussion with a number of test developers both sequencing-based and genotyping-based to bring forward assays where either one of two situations can occur. The first is that the test developer may want to be able to report the genotype or variant or mutation information to the clinician and/or the patient and from the lab. And we're open to that. And we now have prepared recommendations for the validation of such sequencing or genotyping test. So developers can email our template email address and ask for those current - that current thinking. And then there is another pathway that is open. And that is that for test developers who develop a test that both detect SARS-CoV-2 and also genotype or sequence but they, you know, are not wanting to go forward with having those genotype or sequence data reported to clinicians or patients but there is a public health need to - for public health authorities to see that information. So if reporting is only to a public health authority and not to the clinician or patients where the FDA is not going to regulate that genotype or sequencing component of that SARS-CoV-2 detection test. So we would - the FDA would review SARS-CoV-2 detection. And we would make sure that the labeling is appropriate that the genotyping or variant or sequencing information is not transmitted to patients unless validated and authorized by the FDA. You're talking about an extension beyond that and any correlation with specific therapeutics or vaccine. We have not gotten that far in our thinking. I would - always interested in studies and data that show that that's - really has a clinical impact. And, you know, I'm sure at some point it definitely will. So I mean if you have data, publications that, you know, we haven't seen, you can always make sure and forward that to our template's email address and it'll be distributed. We are trying to keep an eye on everything. But we don't necessarily catch everything. And if you have a specific test in development where you would like to make certain claims, you know, submit a pre-EUA and include the information that you think is important.

Adequate performance can be established via validation studies, but this does not fully address concerns about the impact of current or future variants. The serology template includes recommendations for ongoing monitoring and assessing variant impacts.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is FDA's position on a finger stick point of care serology test that uses a full S1 protein antigen and if all performance and criteria in the serology template are included, would this address FDA's concerns on current variants?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So first, we do currently prioritize review of EUA tests where authorization would increase testing accessibility which would include serology tests intended for use at point of care settings. And that's regardless of the antigens used in the assays to capture the antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. And regarding the concerns about variants we do believe that adequate performance demonstrated in the validation studies is important to establish the performance of the test but it would not necessarily address the concerns regarding the potential impact of current or future variants on assay performance. The serology template does include recommendations to provide a plan for monitoring new and emerging SARS-CoV-2 viral mutations and variants on an ongoing basis and for assessing the impact of mutations and variants that have been identified as prevalent or clinically significant on the performance of your assay over time.

#### 13. Guidelines for Validating Breath Tests for SARS-CoV-2 Detection

QA Block 13-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Would it be acceptable to add to the validation test subjects from out of the U.S. for an asymptomatic claim?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is open to studies outside the U.S. for validation tests, but it depends on the intended use setting. For point-of-care or home tests, the FDA prefers validation with U.S. home users in a simulated or real U.S. home environment. Developers should discuss their specific validation plans with the FDA.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Would it be acceptable to add to the validation test subjects from out of the U.S. for an asymptomatic claim?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, the breath test, so we do not know the performance of this new kind of technology. We really don't - for respiratory disease. The FDA doesn't have any experience with this. And so in order for us to authorize a brand new technology like this at least in the beginning until we get and demonstrate that it performs as well as more classical tests, we really do need to see that 100 asymptomatic positives, I think is what our current thinking is. We are open to, as I mentioned earlier in addressing a similar question, we're open to enrichment technology or methods. We want to eliminate bias. So if you want to discuss that I would come in and speak and through our template's email address either as a pre-EUA or a question about whether enrichment can be used for those tests. We are open to studies outside the U.S. as well. It does depend on what setting you want this test to be validated and authorized for. But typically this would be a point of care test and/or it can be even an over-the-counter test or a home test. In those situations such as point of care and in the home, we ideally would like to see U.S. home users used. That can be either in their home or it could be in a simulated home environment that a test developer sets up in any facility they want. So some of these breath tests are not necessarily able to be used at point of care at home due to the equipment requirements, and then it may be limited to more of a moderate or high complexity lab setting. And we may be - it may be easier to show performance in the intended place of use if it's a moderately to high complexity test. So I would come in and ask those specific questions to the FDA. And we'll do our best to ease, you know, the path to demonstrate performance of your breath test.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Is it correct that with 2% prevalence and the requirement for 100 positive asymptomatic cases, approximately 50,000 test subjects would be needed?

And, you know, in the past some of these processes could be connecting up with a Serial Testing Program for schools or workplaces or convalescent centers where the catchment is rather large and you can enrich your population that way. You know one of the challenges with this technology is we're really trying to tell how sensitive and specific it is for a virus and not the actual molecules that technologies are developing - are detecting. You know the analytical detection of those molecules can be proven very easily. But, you know, the implications for clinical diagnosis or screening, you know, haven't been demonstrated.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What additional validation steps are required for the authorization of a breath-based test for respiratory disease?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA requires initial breath-based test technologies to show performance equal to classical tests, including data from 100 asymptomatic positive cases. They are open to enrichment methods and studies outside the U.S., depending on test settings. Validation may vary depending on whether the test is for point-of-care, over-the-counter, or home use settings. Developers should directly consult FDA templates for specific guidance.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What additional validation steps are required for the authorization of a breath-based test for respiratory disease?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, the breath test, so we do not know the performance of this new kind of technology. We really don't - for respiratory disease. The FDA doesn't have any experience with this. And so in order for us to authorize a brand new technology like this at least in the beginning until we get and demonstrate that it performs as well as more classical tests, we really do need to see that 100 asymptomatic positives, I think is what our current thinking is. We are open to, as I mentioned earlier in addressing a similar question, we're open to enrichment technology or methods. We want to eliminate bias. So if you want to discuss that I would come in and speak and through our template's email address either as a pre-EUA or a question about whether enrichment can be used for those tests. We are open to studies outside the U.S. as well. It does depend on what setting you want this test to be validated and authorized for. But typically this would be a point of care test and/or it can be even an over-the-counter test or a home test. In those situations such as point of care and in the home, we ideally would like to see U.S. home users used. That can be either in their home or it could be in a simulated home environment that a test developer sets up in any facility they want. So some of these breath tests are not necessarily able to be used at point of care at home due to the equipment requirements, and then it may be limited to more of a moderate or high complexity lab setting. And we may be - it may be easier to show performance in the intended place of use if it's a moderately to high complexity test. So I would come in and ask those specific questions to the FDA. And we'll do our best to ease, you know, the path to demonstrate performance of your breath test.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the appropriate comparator for an antigen lateral flow test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends using a nasal pharyngeal swab and an EUA-authorized high-sensitivity molecular test as the comparator for antigen lateral flow tests. The test should account for cycle threshold values to assess performance.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the appropriate comparator for an antigen lateral flow test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. For a comparator test and swab for saliva, that doesn't matter whether it's antigen or molecular. We are still recommending a nasal pharyngeal swab. And using a EUA authorized high-sensitivity molecular test. We do look for cycle threshold numbers that are in the lower viral load level to make sure that we know the test performs across the dynamic range. And so you can use a test that doesn't have cycle threshold follow-up. But then we really need to know another test, you know, what the cycle - using another test, what the cycle threshold is. So it's just probably easier to see a comparator test.
