#### 1. FDA Guidance on COVID-19 Diagnostic Testing Policy

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the process to validate a newly developed molecular diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends conducting validation through Limit of Detection, clinical evaluation, inclusivity testing, and cross-reactivity testing. Validation includes measuring LOD as the minimal detectable concentration with high confidence, specific testing guidelines, and ensuring the assay works on multiple specimen types. Inclusivity and cross-reactivity testing are also necessary to ensure accuracy against the target virus and related pathogens.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the process to validate a newly developed molecular diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The guidance includes recommendations regarding the minimal testing to be performed for validation. These include Limit of Detection or LOD, clinical evaluation, inclusivity, cross reactivity. And then comments on the limited viral materials that are available to the FDA, BARDA, and the CDC of prioritized and coordinated shipments to labs when ready to validate. You can address this by sending an email to the FDA email as listed later in this presentation. This is limit of detection testing under this guidance defined as the lowest concentration in which at least 19 of 20 replicates are positive. The methods include we recommend testing dilution series with three Replicates and Concentration Testing. It is recommended to perform replicates at each concentration to determine the range of the Limit of Detection LOD for the assay. After identifying the LOD, confirm the final concentration with 20 replicates. Out of these 20 replicates, at least 19 or all 20 should test positive to meet the detection criteria. Sample Types for Testing. The samples used for testing can be pooled negative clinical samples or artificial matrix. If multiple specimen types are included, prioritize evaluating the most challenging type, such as sputum. Clinical Evaluation Testing. For clinical evaluation testing, it is recommended to test at least 30 contrived reactive specimens and 30 non-reactive specimens. The contrived reactive specimens can be created by spiking viral RNA or an activated virus into leftover clinical specimens. Twenty of the contrived specimens should be spiked at a concentration between 1X and 2X of the determined LOD, with the remaining specimens covering the assay testing range. The acceptable performance criteria for this evaluation is 95% agreement at 1 to 2X LOD. Inclusivity Testing. Inclusivity testing can be conducted through in silico analysis of percent identity matches against publicly available novel coronavirus sequences detectable by the developed molecular assay. It is essential that 100% of published sequences are detectable using the primers and probes selected for the assay. Cross reactivity testing is recommended that you conduct an in silico analysis of the assay primer and probes compared to common respiratory flora and other viral pathogens. There should be greater than 80% homology between one of the primers and probes and any sequence present in the targeted microorganism. It is recommended that you follow recognized laboratory procedures for any additional cross reactivity testing in the context of the sample types intended for testing.

#### 4. Resolving Manufacturing Issues in CDC Test Kits

QA Block 4-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Which reagents were problematic in the initial CDC kits issued?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The issue with the initial CDC kits was related to manufacturing rather than design. The FDA and CDC have resolved these issues, and new kits are now being shipped.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Thank you very much. Just a quick question. I'm wondering if you can tell us, you know, anything as to which of the reagents was the problematic one in the initial kits issued by CDC. There's some report suggesting they were the primers in the N3 reaction. There's other reports suggesting it was something that was creating false positives. I'm just wondering if you can sort of elucidate some of that.
VERBATIM ANSWER: Sure this is what I can tell you that we believe that the design of the original CDC assay that was reviewed under the EUA application is solid. We have a lot of confidence in that. And that includes the N1, N2 and N3 and the control reaction – the RP control reaction. And as regard to CDC assay we have worked closely with them. And we believe we have resolved the manufacturing issues. And so now kits are again being shipped to public health labs. And as I mentioned earlier we are working with more than one manufacturer. But the one we can publicly announce today is IDT. And we have a process to qualify those lots. And as soon as lots are available our laboratories can contact IDT and purchase those kits for their uses. If you purchase those kits under IDT that have been lot qualified, you will not need to submit your own EUA. That's the beauty of this approach. You can simply do the normal verification testing upon receiving a new kit as if it's another EUA authorized kit.

VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. I mean the sensitivity you can imagine that the performance needs to be evaluated towards that concept. And except viral load we will not be able to provide you with a number. But the material that you are spiking will have a certain concentration. And we would like to assure that the assay is sensitive enough for the performance. Regarding the specimen that you said again of course nasal washes and nasal pharyngeal washes are also specimens that clearly are needed for evaluation.

And it is why we're focusing first on molecular techniques because at the moment we want very sensitive techniques to be able to detect the virus. So standard molecular detection LODs for viruses in nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimens are, you know, in the range especially if you know anything about coronavirus in general that would be another place to start.

#### 14. Impact of Breathing Treatments on Test Accuracy

QA Block 14-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Could taking a specimen after a breathing treatment lead to false negatives?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA states that breathing treatments generally do not interfere with nucleic acid-based tests due to robust extraction approaches. Laboratories can test by spiking non-reactive samples to confirm any impact on the limit of detection (LOD).
VERBATIM QUESTION: Could taking a specimen after a breathing treatment lead to false negatives?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Since these are nucleic acid-based tests that are moving forward, I mean we have a good understanding about the extraction approaches that normally these substances are not enough interfering with the assay. So I mean we need to have a compromise – enough approaches available and can be quickly validated. So that was the step that we took in order to allow a faster kind of access to the testing here in our laboratories. And to add to that you certainly can take non-reactive samples that are samples in that way and spike in and see if that affects your LOD in any way.

So we encourage that if that's possible for you.

#### 20. Primer and Probe Sequence Requirements for LDT Validation

QA Block 20-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: If we are using a manufacturer's test kit without access to the precise sequences of the primers and probes, can we use in silico LFS for use as a laboratory-developed test (LDT)?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA requires sequence information for evaluation. If the manufacturer does not provide it, contact the manufacturer to submit a master file for FDA assessment.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If we are using a manufacturer's test kit without access to the precise sequences of the primers and probes, can we use in silico LFS for use as a laboratory-developed test (LDT)?

QE 21-2: Are there published guidelines for verification, or should CLIA guidelines be used?
QE 21-3: If you are validating specimens not currently claimed on the CDC kit, such as stool, does this require an EUA notification or modification?
