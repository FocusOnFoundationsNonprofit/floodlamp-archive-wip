#### 1. Updates on SARS-CoV-2 Test Validations and Mutations

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What specific information is available on the new webpage about the impact of viral mutations on COVID-19 tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA has created a new webpage with details on the impact of viral mutations on COVID-19 tests, including an updated list of affected molecular tests and recommendations. It will serve as a central hub for new updates to supplement earlier communications.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What specific information is available on the new webpage about the impact of viral mutations on COVID-19 tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We posted a new webpage yesterday with information on the impact of viral mutation on COVID-19 tests. This is a follow-up to the letter to healthcare providers and clinical laboratory staff that we issued in January regarding the potential for false-negative results due to the impact of viral mutations on molecular SARS-CoV-2 tests. The webpage includes information about viral mutations and the potential impact as well as listing specific molecular tests that are impacted or where we have seen the potential for impact by viral mutations and specific recommendations for those tests. Right now the webpage includes the three tests that were included in the January safety alert as well as new information on three seitan tests based on new information that we have received. Going forward, we intend to include updates related to viral mutations and the potential impact on tests on this webpage and we will announce any updates through this venue as well as email blasts out to the email list and inclusion on the regular COVID update press releases.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Why are there not more at-home COVID tests currently authorized?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We do have four at-home COVID tests that are currently authorized. We do continue to encourage the development and submission of at-home tests. We previously discussed that we do continue to support innovation in testing and providing support and flexibility to test developers with the goal of increasing the availability of accurate and reliable tests. We do need to point out that FDA does not develop tests. We cannot compel test developers to develop tests for specific characteristics although we have indicated our priorities which do include tests for home use. We're also not involved in the production or distribution of tests. So we do encourage the availability of tests that we have authorized but we are not involved in that. Our role is to determine whether the tests submitted by test developers for emergency authorization meet the criteria for authorization so that we can provide a level of assurance that they produce results that American's can trust. We will continue to work with test developers to support the availability of more innovative testing options. Yes, and unfortunately today with regards to molecular and antigen tests, specifically we simply have a positive of fully validated for home use tests submitted. So we do encourage test developers to come in with home use tests and we've made it much easier now to get that OTC claim beginning without any data on any symptomatic prior to authorization. That pathway was outlined last week where if your performance meets a certain level, in-home user studies, for symptomatic patients, then you can simply agree to update your label with the serial testing claim and we will update your authorization for OTC and look forward to receiving a post market study showing adequate performance in the symptomatic population via that serial testing program.

#### 5. Limitations of SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Tests Post-Vaccination

QA Block 5-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are currently authorized SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests validated to determine protective immunity after vaccination?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA clarified that currently authorized SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests are not validated to determine protective immunity or evaluate post-vaccination immunity. The clinical significance of results post-vaccination is unknown, and these tests do not account for cellular immunity or non-spike protein antibodies.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are currently authorized SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests validated to determine protective immunity after vaccination?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We do want to clarify that the currently authorized SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are not validated or authorized to evaluate protective immunity and they're not specifically enabled for use after vaccinations. So clinical significance of a positive or negative SARS-CoV-2 antibody test results in individuals that have received a COVID-19 vaccination is currently unknown. Not all the testable antibodies are protective and for other illnesses and SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests do not directly evaluate other components of the adoptive immune response such as cellular immunity which may contribute to protection from infection after vaccination. Additionally, since vaccines induce antibodies to specific viral protein targets, post-vaccination serologic tests results will be negative in persons without history of previous natural infection if the test that was used does not detect antibodies induced anything the vaccine.

Not all the testable antibodies are protective and for other illnesses and SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests do not directly evaluate other components of the adoptive immune response such as cellular immunity which may contribute to protection from infection after vaccination. Additionally, since vaccines induce antibodies to specific viral protein targets, post-vaccination serologic tests results will be negative in persons without history of previous natural infection if the test that was used does not detect antibodies induced by the vaccine.

REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 5-5
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What implications do false-negative serology test results have following vaccination?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: False-negative serology test results after vaccination may occur if the test does not target the specific antibodies induced by the vaccine, particularly spike proteins. Such results are not reliable for assessing immune response to the vaccine.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What implications do false-negative serology test results have following vaccination?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Additionally, since vaccines induce antibodies to specific viral protein targets, post-vaccination serologic tests results will be negative in persons without history of previous natural infection if the test that was used does not detect antibodies induced anything the vaccine. Additionally, a serology test that doesn't target a spike protein will not be a good measure of whether there is an immune response to the vaccine. We have received reports of false negatives when clinicians have ordered unintelligible protein serology tests following vaccination one of the three authorized vaccines.

#### 13. Evaluating Sensitivity Differences in Symptomatic and Asymptomatic Testing

QA Block 13-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the requirement for studying asymptomatic and symptomatic populations in antigen or molecular tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA requires smaller study populations under EUA authorization than full approval, with 30 positive symptomatic cases required for symptomatic claims and 10 for asymptomatic claims. The FDA emphasizes overall test performance beyond LOD because symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals can show significant differences in viral load and test sensitivity.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the requirement for studying asymptomatic and symptomatic populations in antigen or molecular tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah, so you know, asymptomatic carriers of the, you know, the DSL3 virus is unusual. And you know, and we're still learning about the biology of the disease. The data that we've seen are mixed is whether for a given device and a given population, whether viral loads and detection of asymptomatic are equivalent to symptomatic. And in other words we have seen differences between those populations and when we see differences the viral loads are lower for asymptomatic carriers. And therefore, when you look at the whole test and how it's performed which is more - which is important and not just LOD because LOD assessment can vary from developer to developer. There aren't necessarily good ways to harmonize and also to translate that into clinical sensitivity. So we have really because there are EUA authorizations, we have the authority under the law to lower the recommendations for validation and you know instead of a couple hundred virus positive patients in a clinical study for full authorization, we have required only for symptomatic populations, 30 positive as a minimum. Then to add an asymptomatic claim premarket again, only 10 positive symptomatic patients. So, with as appropriate with an agreement to complete more asymptomatic tests studies after authorization. So the bottom line is that we look at the performance of the whole test not just in the laboratory LOD. Because that tells you how the test will perform and watch closely in the real world. And we have seen significant differences in viral load and detection, actual sensitivity or PPA between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals in the same study.

QA Block 13-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Why should we use different populations (symptomatic versus asymptomatic) instead of focusing on overall sensitivity or limit of detection (LOD)?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA evaluates the performance of the whole test, not just the LOD, because differences in viral load and detection between symptomatic and asymptomatic populations impact clinical sensitivity. Lower viral loads in asymptomatic carriers create variations, necessitating separate validations for these populations.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Why should we use different populations (symptomatic versus asymptomatic) instead of focusing on overall sensitivity or limit of detection (LOD)?

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the rationale for focusing on separate populations rather than overall CT values or safety distributions in molecular tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA focuses on separate populations because data show significant differences in viral loads and test sensitivity between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. LOD assessments are not always harmonized across developers and do not fully translate into clinical sensitivity, which is why the FDA evaluates test performance with real-world data and sets specific validation requirements for each population.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the rationale behind emphasizing sensitivity and LOD in Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs) regardless of symptoms?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA emphasizes overall test performance over LOD alone due to observed differences in viral loads and detection between symptomatic and asymptomatic populations, making LOD less consistent across developers and harder to translate into clinical sensitivity. Regulatory flexibility allows reduced validation requirements for authorization.

You can send it to the template's email address about just what the feedback you're getting from some of those are because we would like to understand the challenges faced by developers such as yourself in that and getting access to these previously authorized home collection kits. There is one situation where there that I know of and Toby may know of others where there's a global auto reference and the individual developers don't have to go and get that. That's based on, and I'm forgetting both partners here, but it was a Gate-sponsored study where they did home collection using a nasal swab in a particular media. I'm not sure if it's both VTM and saline. The details escape me. But if you were to mimic exactly what they did in their study which is totally acceptable, you know, that works and makes it easy for developers like you to them get that right to reference because you don't have to go to Gates to get it.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: How does the FDA recommend developers address potential risks related to viral mutations in molecular tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA has posted a webpage with information on the viral mutation impact on COVID-19 molecular tests and specific recommendations. Updates will be centralized here instead of issuing individual alerts, and further announcements will be made via emails and press releases.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How does the FDA recommend developers address potential risks related to viral mutations in molecular tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We posted a new webpage yesterday with information on the impact of viral mutation on COVID-19 tests. This is a follow-up to the letter to healthcare providers and clinical laboratory staff that we issued in January regarding the potential for false- negative results due to the impact of viral mutations on molecular SARS-CoV-2 tests. The webpage includes information about viral mutations and the potential impact as well as listing specific molecular tests that are impacted or where we have seen the potential for impact by viral mutations and specific recommendations for those tests. Right now the webpage includes the three tests that were included in the January safety alert as well as new information on three seitan tests based on new information that we have received. Going forward, we intend to include updates related to viral mutations and the potential impact on tests on this webpage and we will announce any updates through this venue as well as email blasts out to the email list and inclusion on the regular COVID update press releases. So we'll use that as a central location for those types of updates rather than individual safety alerts each time there are issues that we become aware of.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What factors influence the FDA's decision to prioritize certain EUA requests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA prioritizes EUA requests based on factors like increasing testing accessibility, boosting testing capacity (e.g., reducing reliance on supplies, high throughput, widely distributed tests), and addressing current public health needs. Current priorities include high volume and accurate results for lab, at-home, or point-of-care testing. Developers are encouraged to inquire directly about specific decisions.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What factors influence the FDA's decision to prioritize certain EUA requests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So we just want to clarify that there are many factors that go into our prioritization decision and some of those factors may not be publicly evident regarding the tests that are authorized. We have previously stated that we prioritize review of the A requests for tests that increase testing accessibility such as point of care, home collection and at-home tests. Tests that would significantly increase testing capacity such as tests that reduce reliance on test supplies, high throughput, widely distributed tests to address the public health needs. We do recommend that if you have questions about a decision about your particular test that you reach out to ask that specific question. I would add that at this time pandemic is very different. Our needs are very different as a nation than they were at the beginning of the pandemic and what was possible at the beginning of the pandemic. So we seek to focus review attention and prioritization. And basically call out to developers what the, to give incentive to develop tests that are really needed right now. So high volume, accurate results, whether they're in the laboratory or they're at home or home collection or in point of care are the priorities right now.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are there global rights to reference for any home collection devices?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: There is a global right to reference data from a Gate-sponsored study for nasal swab-based home collection kits, provided developers mimic their validated procedures. Developers do not need to obtain specific permission.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are there global rights to reference for any home collection devices?
VERBATIM ANSWER: There is one situation where there that I know of and Toby may know of others where there's a global auto reference and the individual developers don't have to go and get that. That's based on, and I'm forgetting both partners here, but it was a Gate-sponsored study where they did home collection using a nasal swab in a particular media. I'm not sure if it's both VTM and saline. The details escape me. But if you were to mimic exactly what they did in their study which is totally acceptable, you know, that works and makes it easy for developers like you to them get that right to reference because you don't have to go to Gates to get it. It's just global. So the best way to find out about all that is really to send a specific question into the template's email address asking about global right to reference for any home collection devices.
