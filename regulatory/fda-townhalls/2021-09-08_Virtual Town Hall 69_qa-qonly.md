#### 1. COVID-19 Test Development and Authorization Guidelines Presentation

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the considerations for starting validation studies within the US versus outside the US for SARS-CoV-2 tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends starting SARS-CoV-2 test validation studies in the US, especially for point-of-care or home tests, due to the availability of positive patient samples. If there are obstacles in obtaining enough positive samples, developers can consult FDA about conducting studies outside the US. For panel tests, testing outside the US may be an option where flu is more prevalent.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the considerations for starting validation studies within the US versus outside the US for SARS-CoV-2 tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: I do want to remind those that have been inquiring through perhaps the pre-EUA process about OUS, or outside the US, studies for SARS, since there are plenty of patients, positive patients in the US, and as I've said before-- we said before that we really want you to start your studies in the US where possible and especially for point of care and home diagnostic tests. And that only if you run into hurdles about getting enough positive patients you reach out to us and find ways that you can perhaps go outside the US. Regarding panel tests which we'll talk about a little bit more later, in the US right now there's hardly any flu circulating. And there may be parts of the world where there's more flu and obviously for panel tests, it may be easier in some cases to get positives outside the US, so that's still one caveat.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Validation study location, Point-of-care/home diagnostics, Panel tests
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What should developers do if they face challenges in obtaining sufficient positive patient samples in the US for SARS-CoV-2 test validation studies?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Developers should start validation studies for SARS-CoV-2 tests in the US, especially for point-of-care and home tests. If challenges arise in obtaining enough positive samples, they should contact the FDA to explore options, including conducting studies outside the US.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What should developers do if they face challenges in obtaining sufficient positive patient samples in the US for SARS-CoV-2 test validation studies?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We note, unfortunately, that COVID infections are very prevalent in the US today as they are in many parts of the world. I do want to remind those that have been inquiring through perhaps the pre-EUA process about OUS, or outside the US, studies for SARS, since there are plenty of patients, positive patients in the US, and as I've said before-- we said before that we really want you to start your studies in the US where possible and especially for point of care and home diagnostic tests. And that only if you run into hurdles about getting enough positive patients you reach out to us and find ways that you can perhaps go outside the US.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: SARS-CoV-2 test validation, Positive patient sample availability, FDA contact for assistance
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How should panel tests be validated when certain analytes, such as flu A/B, are not circulating widely in the US?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends using fresh samples for validation of panel tests, specifically for non-SARS viruses like flu A/B. Banked or contrived samples are not recommended. Developers can either use fully authorized existing assays to assess these analytes or consider blocking or not identifying signals for analytes lacking fresh samples.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How should panel tests be validated when certain analytes, such as flu A/B, are not circulating widely in the US?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We recommend fresh samples. Banked or even contrived samples for non-SARS viruses are going to be-- are not something that we recommend. There are, at least in the point of care in central lab, there are a number of flu AB or RSV assays that are fully authorized that can be used to assess patients for them. So if you are developing a panel assay where it's challenging because, especially for antigen, we're going to recommend that you have fresh samples. We recommend that you consider a ways of getting your SARS analytes authorized and somehow blocking the signal or not identifying the signal for any other analytes you might have on that panel for which you don't have available fresh samples to validate the assay.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Panel test validation, Flu A/B testing, Fresh sample requirement
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Why are fresh samples recommended for validating home diagnostic assays, particularly for non-SARS viruses?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends fresh samples for validating home diagnostic assays, particularly for non-SARS viruses, because banked or contrived samples are not reliable for this purpose. Fully authorized flu AB or RSV assays are available to assess patients in point of care or central labs.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Why are fresh samples recommended for validating home diagnostic assays, particularly for non-SARS viruses?
VERBATIM ANSWER: For antigen tests in particular and for all home diagnostic assays, we do recommend fresh samples. Banked or even contrived samples for non-SARS viruses are going to be-- are not something that we recommend. There are, at least in the point of care in central lab, there are a number of flu AB or RSV assays that are fully authorized that can be used to assess patients for them. So if you are developing a panel assay where it's challenging because, especially for antigen, we're going to recommend that you have fresh samples.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Validation of home diagnostic assays, Use of fresh samples, Non-SARS viruses
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-5
CLARIFIED QUESTION: In cases where fresh samples are unavailable for panel tests, what is the FDA's specific recommendation for handling the non-SARS analytes?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends using fresh samples for panel tests and does not endorse banked or contrived samples for non-SARS analytes. Developers should find ways to block or not identify non-SARS analytes lacking fresh sample validation.
VERBATIM QUESTION: In cases where fresh samples are unavailable for panel tests, what is the FDA's specific recommendation for handling the non-SARS analytes?
VERBATIM ANSWER: For antigen tests in particular and for all home diagnostic assays, we do recommend fresh samples. Banked or even contrived samples for non-SARS viruses are going to be-- are not something that we recommend. There are, at least in the point of care in central lab, there are a number of flu AB or RSV assays that are fully authorized that can be used to assess patients for them.

SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Panel tests, Fresh samples, Non-SARS analytes
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-6
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How is the FDA currently prioritizing antigen test submissions for review and authorization?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is currently prioritizing antigen submissions by reviewing tests on a first-come, first-served basis when they are of relatively equivalent priority.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How is the FDA currently prioritizing antigen test submissions for review and authorization?
VERBATIM ANSWER: As we move forward, particularly for the antigen submissions, we are moving towards-- we've noted that in many cases, the relative priorities of antigen submissions, at this time at least, is relatively equivalent. So we are moving, and I've directed the team to move, to making sure that first in for these tests that are in this category of being roughly equivalent, that generally we will review them on a first come, first serve basis, a first in, would likely get-- we endeavor to get comments back or other feedback back or potentially authorizations first.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: FDA antigen test prioritization, Review process, Diagnostic submissions
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-7
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the current high-priority areas for serology tests from the FDA's perspective?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA's high-priority areas for serology tests are quantitative tests traceable to the international WHO standard and neutralizing antibody serology tests.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the current high-priority areas for serology tests from the FDA's perspective?
VERBATIM ANSWER: For serology, the highest priority tests are quantitative tests that are traceable to the international WHO standard as well as neutralizing antibody serology tests.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: High-priority serology tests, FDA priorities, Serology test criteria
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-8
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What guidelines exist for implementing changes to EUA-authorized devices before authorization of the modification, especially concerning different testing environments (e.g., high complexity labs versus home use)?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Modifications to EUA-authorized devices can only be implemented prior to authorization in high complexity labs. Moderately complex, point-of-care, or home environments must wait for EUA authorization. The policy guidance specifies that tests are limited to labs certified for high complexity under CLIA unless expanded by an EUA.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What guidelines exist for implementing changes to EUA-authorized devices before authorization of the modification, especially concerning different testing environments (e.g., high complexity labs versus home use)?
VERBATIM ANSWER: One other item we wish to note is that for kit developers that are implementing changes to their EUA authorized devices, when you implement a change prior to EUA authorization of that change, that's only going to be relevant to high complexity labs. So other labs or home situations, whether that be moderately complex or point of care or home, are not going to be able to be implemented prior to authorization. So reading from the COVID test policy guidance as well as FAQs, "Unless and until an EUA is issued that authorizes additional testing environments for a specific test under CLIA, use of that test is limited to laboratories certified to perform high complexity testing and including testing at the point of care when the site is covered by the laboratory's CLIA certificate for high complexity testing." End quote. So again, for implementation of modifications, those can be implemented prior to EUA authorization in a high complexity environment.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: EUA changes, CLIA certifications, Testing environment limitations
REVIEW FLAG: False


#### 2. FDA Process for COVID Test Authorizations and Prioritizations

QA Block 2-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: When will COVID-19 tests begin receiving full clearance?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA granted full authorization for the first COVID-19 molecular test in March (BioFire Respiratory 2.1 Panel). EUAs remain valid and prioritized due to the need for expanded testing capabilities. Additional full authorizations will follow as submissions are reviewed.
VERBATIM QUESTION: When will COVID-19 tests begin receiving full clearance?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The FDA has granted full marketing authorization for the first COVID 19 molecular test back in March. That was the BioFire Respiratory 2.1 Panel which included the SARS-CoV-2 virus on that panel. It was granted marketing authorization using the de novo pre-market path-- review pathway. So the grant and all subsequent molecular, essentially all subsequent molecular submissions, can then be 510k. Or, serology and antigen tests we haven't yet authorized a full authorization for those, so those first authorizations will be a grant through the de novo review pathway. And further, that this authorization of the BioFire does not impact the EUAs for any other tests. We're not pulling those EUAs from the market. We have no intention of doing that. We will continue to authorize tests through the EUA pathway and tests authorized under EUAs can be used. More full authorizations will occur as developers submit them to the FDA and our team is able to grant or clear those submissions. However, since test EUAs are still being accepted, reviewed, and authorized, they will continue to receive higher priority than full authorizations, though. And this should be for obvious reasons. That we're still looking to expand testing capability and converting an EUA to a full authorization as usual and not expanding testing and pulls our reviewers away from EUA authorizations. So we are prioritizing -- still prioritizing EUA authorizations. However, some have already come in and we anticipate authorizing more.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Full test authorization, EUA prioritization, De novo pathway
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 2-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the process for obtaining full marketing authorization for a COVID-19 molecular test after receiving EUA approval?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA grants full marketing authorization for molecular tests via the de novo pre-market review pathway, followed by subsequent 510(k) submissions for similar molecular tests. Serology and antigen tests will also initially pursue the de novo route once authorized.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the process for obtaining full marketing authorization for a COVID-19 molecular test after receiving EUA approval?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The FDA has granted full marketing authorization for the first COVID 19 molecular test back in March. That was the BioFire Respiratory 2.1 Panel which included the SARS-CoV-2 virus on that panel. It was granted marketing authorization using the de novo pre-market path-- review pathway.

REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 2-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are serology and antigen tests required to go through the de novo review pathway for their first full authorization?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Serology and antigen tests will require authorization through the de novo review pathway for their first full authorization.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are serology and antigen tests required to go through the de novo review pathway for their first full authorization?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Or, serology and antigen tests we haven't yet authorized a full authorization for those, so those first authorizations will be a grant through the de novo review pathway.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: serology tests, antigen tests, de novo review pathway
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 2-5
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the FDA plan to remove previously granted EUA tests from the market once full authorizations are issued?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA does not plan to pull EUA tests from the market as full authorizations are issued. EUA-authorized tests can continue to be used.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA plan to remove previously granted EUA tests from the market once full authorizations are issued?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The FDA has granted full marketing authorization for the first COVID 19 molecular test back in March. That was the BioFire Respiratory 2.1 Panel which included the SARS-CoV-2 virus on that panel. It was granted marketing authorization using the de novo pre-market path-- review pathway.

TOPICS: EUA tests, full marketing authorizations, FDA testing policies
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 2-6
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Why are EUA authorizations being prioritized over full authorizations for COVID-19 tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is prioritizing EUA authorizations because they support the expansion of testing capacity. Converting tests from EUA to full authorization diverts resources without increasing testing availability.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Why are EUA authorizations being prioritized over full authorizations for COVID-19 tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: However, since test EUAs are still being accepted, reviewed, and authorized, they will continue to receive higher priority than full authorizations, though. And this should be for obvious reasons. That we're still looking to expand testing capability and converting an EUA to a full authorization as usual and not expanding testing and pulls our reviewers away from EUA authorizations. So we are prioritizing -- still prioritizing EUA authorizations.

TOPICS: EUA prioritization, full authorizations, COVID-19 tests
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 2-7
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What steps should a test developer follow to transition from an EUA to a full authorization?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Test developers should submit their applications for full authorization through the appropriate FDA pathways, such as the de novo review pathway for the first authorization, followed by 510(k) for subsequent molecular tests. The FDA will review and grant full authorizations as submissions are received, but EUA applications remain a priority.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What steps should a test developer follow to transition from an EUA to a full authorization?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The FDA has granted full marketing authorization for the first COVID 19 molecular test back in March. That was the BioFire Respiratory 2.1 Panel which included the SARS-CoV-2 virus on that panel. It was granted marketing authorization using the de novo pre-market review pathway.

QA Block 2-8
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Has the FDA authorized any additional full marketing approvals for COVID-19 molecular tests beyond the BioFire Respiratory Panel 2.1?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA has not authorized any additional full marketing approvals for molecular tests since the BioFire Panel. EUAs remain prioritized for testing expansions, and more full authorizations will occur as submissions are reviewed and cleared.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Has the FDA authorized any additional full marketing approvals for COVID-19 molecular tests beyond the BioFire Respiratory Panel 2.1?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The FDA has granted full marketing authorization for the first COVID 19 molecular test back in March. That was the BioFire Respiratory 2.1 Panel which included the SARS-CoV-2 virus on that panel. It was granted marketing authorization using the de novo pre-market path-- review pathway.

#### 3. Potential Diagnostic Tools for COVID-19 Long Hauler Patients

QA Block 3-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are there tests being developed to track viral loads and associate them with disease activity in COVID-19 patients, such as long haulers?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is open to submissions for viral load tests but questions their clinical usefulness for patient management since recommendations discourage their use. Research on biomarkers and serology tests is ongoing to help diagnose long hauler patients, though limited authorization exists, like IL-6 assays.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are there tests being developed to track viral loads and associate them with disease activity in COVID-19 patients, such as long haulers?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Of course. I don't believe that universally the long haulers still shed virus. And as far as viral load tests, which would be fully quantitative tests, if such test is something that the developer wishes to pursue, that would involve the use of calibrators linked to the international WHO standard. However, while we're open to considering such submissions, it does remain unclear to us what the clinical usefulness of such viral load assays would be. Certainly see lots of research potential for so many doing purely research and wanting to try to figure out if viral loads mean anything. We continue to monitor the literature. We also continue to monitor the CDC recommendations, other professional and lab associations and to date, they appear to uniformly discourage the use of viral loads in patient management. As far as long hauler patients go, there's likely a need to identify these patients upfront if possible or to assist in their diagnosis. We do know that there are publications that a patient who has -- suspected of long hauler disease and didn't have a diagnostic test performed when they may have been exposed and develop an infection because non symptomatic-- asymptomatic individuals can suffer from long hauler. Or some may have been symptomatic and simply didn't get-- and had a mild disease and simply didn't get a diagnostic test. So there are publications and clinicians can do their best to use serology tests to identify whether those patients have, in fact, been previously exposed to SARS. That may come in handy. And there are, we know, a number of developers who are looking at other biomarkers to try to assess risk and potentially diagnose a long hauler in addition to other clinical hallmarks of that disease. And so we do remain open to those submissions and discussions with developers for that. But we have not, other than for IL 6 which predicts potential for ventilation, we've authorized three IL 6 assays, other than that, we have not authorized any other sort of immune response assays for use in patients who suffer from more severe consequences of the virus and/or long hauler.

TOPICS: Viral load testing, Long haulers, Diagnostic biomarkers
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 3-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the validation requirements for developing fully quantitative viral load tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Developers of fully quantitative viral load tests need to use calibrators linked to the WHO standard. FDA is open to submissions but notes uncertainty regarding their clinical usefulness.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the validation requirements for developing fully quantitative viral load tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: As far as viral load tests, which would be fully quantitative tests, if such test is something that the developer wishes to pursue, that would involve the use of calibrators linked to the international WHO standard. However, while we're open to considering such submissions, it does remain unclear to us what the clinical usefulness of such viral load assays would be.

TOPICS: Emergency Use Authorization, viral load tests, research applications
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 3-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are there recommendations for identifying long hauler patients who were asymptomatic or did not receive diagnostic testing during their initial infection?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Publications suggest using serology tests to identify prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure in patients suspected of long hauler disease who were asymptomatic or not tested during initial infection. Developers are also exploring other biomarkers to assist diagnosis.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are there recommendations for identifying long hauler patients who were asymptomatic or did not receive diagnostic testing during their initial infection?

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can serology tests be used to assist in diagnosing long hauler patients and what specific criteria should they meet?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Clinicians can use serology tests to help identify if long hauler patients have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2, and developers are exploring other biomarkers to diagnose such patients. The FDA is open to submissions for these developments.
VERBATIM QUESTION: IMPLICIT
VERBATIM ANSWER: As far as long hauler patients go, there's likely a need to identify these patients up front if possible or to assist in their diagnosis. We do know that there are publications that a patient who has -- suspected of long hauler disease and didn't have a diagnostic test performed when they may have been exposed and develop an infection because non symptomatic-- asymptomatic individuals can suffer from long hauler.

#### 4. Limitations on Using Contrived Flu Samples for Validation

QA Block 4-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is it possible to use contrived swab samples to prepare for an EUA submission for a rapid lateral flow test for SARS-CoV-2, flu A, and flu B antigens?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA does not recommend using contrived swab samples for lateral flow tests targeting SARS-CoV-2, flu A, and flu B antigens, due to challenges with VTM and the availability of validated alternatives. Validation should use fresh samples for antigen targets where possible, ensuring results are not shared with clinicians or patients.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is it possible to use contrived swab samples to prepare for an EUA submission for a rapid lateral flow test for SARS-CoV-2, flu A, and flu B antigens?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So we do not recommend this for a number of reasons. One is we actually don't recommend VTM for lateral flow use for SARS or really any other virus.

#### 6. FDA Concerns on Saliva-Based SARS-CoV-2 Testing Validation

QA Block 6-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is the FDA considering a shift to allow highly sensitive saliva-based comparator assays to validate a point-of-care test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA does not currently consider saliva to be a better sample type than nasal swabs for validation. Saliva is considered challenging due to uncertainties in detecting other respiratory viruses, and new tests using saliva must be validated against highly sensitive molecular tests with paired NP swabs.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is the FDA considering a shift to allow highly sensitive saliva-based comparator assays to validate a point-of-care test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So, in our view, based on the data and the review of literature, we would not agree with the assessment of this person who sent in this question as far as saliva being a better sample type than nasal or one of the nasal swabs. Saliva, in our view, remains a very challenging sample type. Obviously it's challenging because we don't know whether flu A B or other respiratory viruses are able to be detected as accurately or accurately enough to be utilized in an assay. So we do currently still recommend that new tests utilize-- they want to use a live saliva sample validated in a clinical study compared to a paired NP swab using a highly sensitive molecular test as a comparative method.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA generally allows anterior nasal swab comparisons for EUA, but typically grants only a nasal swab claim in such cases. Validation for other respiratory samples and an on-label EUA test as part of the comparative method are recommended.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Would it be acceptable to establish anterior nasal swab claims by comparing nasal swab performance on the candidate test to nasal swab results with the BioFire 2.1, provided that an LOD equivalency study for nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs is conducted for the BioFire?
VERBATIM ANSWER: It is generally acceptable to perform an anterior nasal swab to anterior nasal swab comparison for EUA. However, in this case, only a nasal swab claim will be granted. We recommend further validation for other respiratory sample claims. So I believe the intended use for the BioFire perhaps does not include anterior nasal swabs so I would suggest that this person, again, write up a detailed proposal explaining exactly what they would do and the justification and we can consider that going forward.

Obviously, if our reviewers had asked for a post-market study, it was to confirm something so that the test that's currently on market is known to be functional – so - and getting accurate results. So, but I think that's a question specifically to the lead reviewer for your first authorization. And to-- if you submitted a pre EUA or you're preparing an EUA for the second test that you include the reviewer that might be assigned to that. But I think we're going to want to know a lot more details before we give you specific advice. I don't want to say no without knowing those details that we obviously want to be as flexible as possible in our determination.

#### 9. Availability and Options for At-Home COVID Testing

QA Block 9-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are there other COVID-19 tests coming soon that can get approval?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA has authorized 13 at-home COVID-19 tests, with over 60 home collection devices available. Manufacturers are struggling to meet demand amid the Delta surge, and the government is funding production increases. The FDA prioritizes home environment test submissions and works to approve accurate tests quickly.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are there other COVID-19 tests coming soon that can get approval?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So, yeah. Thank you for calling. And we in fact have authorized 13 at home tests. I believe at least seven varieties of them are cleared or authorized for over the counter. We're very well aware with the Delta surge that the manufacturers are struggling to keep up with the demand. And the US government is funding an increase in the production of those tests in order to try to alleviate this issue. On the other hand, we have authorized over 60, it might be over 70, home collection devices. So there's a variety of sources for those home collection through various entities as well as online sellers that are authorized to do that. So always double check. Make sure they're authorized. And many are over the counter collection devices. So no prescription is needed. The turnaround time is obviously a little bit longer than a test that you can perform at home and that should be taken into account. But I certainly know of individuals who have purchased those home collection devices where they're reasonably affordable and have a stash at home. So the other option that you have is to look at any of the national providers of testing services or local providers of testing services and they may have some options for you as well. So the national reference labs, the biggest among them are Labcorp and Quest. There are other excellent reference labs out there. And they each have home testing available as well. So you may want to check them out. It's a home collection device. Amazon has a home collection device and I apologize to the manufacturers on the call. I don't have a complete list, but the complete list of home collection devices and home tests is on the FDA website and we continue to highly prioritize tests that come in for submission for the home environment, whether it's a home test for the diagnosis of SARS or home collection for the diagnosis of SARS. So either in the home antigen or molecular tests, or for collection, it's usually a molecular test. And those remain our highest priority. And when we receive a submission that is complete and provides the evidence that we know the tests would be accurate. We have unfortunately had to deny authorization for tests that were clearly not accurate. Or perhaps in some cases where we had evidence that we could not trust the data that they submitted. And as soon as these home submissions come in and they look good, they are the very highest priorities for us to review. And overall, we now are approaching 410 test authorizations by the FDA. So there are various ways to get it but I certainly understand the current situation and it's unfortunate. And at least from the FDA perspective, by authorizing accurate tests as fast as we can, we are going to continue to do our part.

And having been on the other end, on the test developer side, and the ability to ramp up production is sometimes a challenge. So it does take time. You're not going to necessarily want to ramp up production until you get an EUA authorization. And also, the distributors that you might use including online and retail stores that might want to sell your test are going to want to know that your test is EUA authorized before making room on their shelves for that.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What specific factors does the FDA prioritize when reviewing COVID-19 diagnostic submissions?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA prioritizes submissions that are complete with all necessary information provided clearly. Incomplete submissions or those requiring significant follow-up are given lower priority. Developers are advised to ensure submissions align with FDA recommendations or provide clear justifications for deviations.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What specific factors does the FDA prioritize when reviewing COVID-19 diagnostic submissions?
VERBATIM ANSWER: As I mentioned earlier, and sort of the reverse of what I said, so if a submission comes in and it's complete and our reviewers don't have to ask any questions, it gets high priority. But the reverse is also true that if a test-- if a submission is not fully complete and we have questions, it is going to not be as high priority as tests that are complete and that we can-- and all the information is there and in a manner at which we can understand how the validation was done and can move forward on those authorizations. It's incredibly rare for all of this-- for any of the submissions to be fully complete. So even on the highest priority test submissions, there is a fair bit of back and forth. And we're entirely dependent, once we've asked the question, on how fast that developer gets back to us. So the recommendation that we would have is that make sure that your submissions are complete, they're well done, that they generally follow our recommendation.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Once a COVID-19 test is fully cleared, will EUA tests no longer be allowed for use?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: EUA tests will still be allowed for use even after some COVID-19 tests receive full authorization. FDA has no intention of pulling EUAs from the market and will continue authorizing tests under EUA.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Once a COVID-19 test is fully cleared, will EUA tests no longer be allowed for use?
VERBATIM ANSWER: This authorization of the BioFire does not impact the EUAs for any other tests. We're not pulling those EUAs from the market. We have no intention of doing that. We will continue to authorize tests through the EUA pathway and tests authorized under EUAs can be used.

QA Block 5-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is the FDA considering EUA submissions for saliva-based multiplexed flu and COVID molecular tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA considers saliva-based flu testing to have limited supporting data and recommends using the molecular EUA template with paired sample clinical designs for validation. Home collection is likely possible, and specific questions can be addressed through the FDA inbox or assigned reviewer.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is the FDA considering EUA submissions for saliva-based multiplexed flu and COVID molecular tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The data supporting flu testing using a saliva sample is limited. Also, there are no clear devices or EU tests -- EUA tests -- which are authorized for the detection of flu in a select sample. Our recommendations are to establish an EUA claim for flu. We recommend using the molecular EUA template which notes testing banked positive samples. Unfortunately, some of these samples are not available in saliva. So in lieu of that, we do recommend a paired sample clinical study design establishing performance of a saliva sample compared to nasopharyngeal swab samples. To support a flu claim for saliva, this should be done prospectively. Furthermore, validation using fresh, prospectively collected positive samples will likely be challenging as incidents of flu infections remain low. The second part is home collection and that is something that is likely possible. We do have a number of home collection kits and that specific question can be answered either via the inbox or if you have a reviewer for your test.

QA Block 6-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the FDA have any plans to consider saliva comparator assays for validation of new point-of-care diagnostic tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA does not consider saliva a better sample type than nasal swabs and finds saliva samples challenging due to uncertainties about their accuracy in detecting other respiratory viruses. FDA recommends validating saliva samples in clinical studies compared to nasal swabs using a highly sensitive molecular test.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA have any plans to consider saliva comparator assays for validation of new point-of-care diagnostic tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So, in our view, based on the data and the review of literature, we would not agree with the assessment of this person who sent in this question as far as saliva being a better sample type than nasal or one of the nasal swabs. Saliva, in our view, remains a very challenging sample type. Obviously it's challenging because we don't know whether flu A B or other respiratory viruses are able to be detected as accurately or accurately enough to be utilized in an assay. So we do currently still recommend that new tests utilize-- they want to use a live saliva sample validated in a clinical study compared to a paired NP swab using a highly sensitive molecular test as a comparative method.

QA Block 7-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the performance expectations when establishing performance for an anterior nasal swab by comparing it to a paired BioFire 2.1 nasopharyngeal swab result?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA expects a PTA greater than 90% and an NPA greater than 95% when comparing an anterior nasal swab performance to a paired BioFire 2.1 nasopharyngeal swab result using an FDA-cleared molecular test.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If establishing performance for an anterior nasal swab by comparing to a paired BioFire 2.1 NP swab result, what are the performance expectations?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So again, this is covered in the template. And I believe that you should definitely check with the template. But I think we're looking for a PTA of greater than 90% and an NPA of greater than 95% in comparison to an FDA cleared molecular test.

QA Block 13-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How should a developer address deviations from FDA recommendations in their submission?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends making submissions complete, well-prepared, and aligned with their guidance. If deviations occur, developers should provide justification in writing to address potential questions.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How should a developer address deviations from FDA recommendations in their submission?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The recommendation that we would have is that make sure that your submissions are complete, they're well done, that they generally follow our recommendation. That if for some reason our recommendations are not followed, that will entertain questions on our part. Some of those potentially could be mitigated if there's good written justification for their changes.
