#### 1. FDA Guidance on COVID-19 Testing Updates

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the FDA's validation recommendations for tests offered under policies and guidance as well as those submitted for EUA?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends that validation for all tests, including those under policies, guidance, and EUA submissions, adhere to the policy guidance and EUA templates provided.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the FDA's validation recommendations for tests offered under policies and guidance as well as those submitted for EUA?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Our recommendation for validation for all tests including tests offered under the policies and the guidance as well as the tests that have submitted for an EUA prior to offering the test that our recommendations for validation for all of those are included in the policy guidance as well as in the EUA templates that are referenced from the guidance.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: validation recommendations, EUA submissions, policy guidance
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How should developers validate modifications to an EUA-authorized test for a new specimen type, such as saliva?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends developers modifying an EUA-authorized test for a new specimen type, like saliva, refer to policy guidance and the molecular diagnostics template for validation recommendations.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How should developers validate modifications to an EUA-authorized test for a new specimen type, such as saliva?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We also clarified in the questions, FAQ, about the modifications policy and about bridging studies that the policy on modifications for use of a new specimen type does not reference bridging studies. So we would recommend that developers who are modifying an EUA authorized test for use of a new specimen type such as saliva, refer to the policy guidance and the molecular diagnostics template for information about our recommendations on validation for the new specimen type.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: EUA test modifications, Validation recommendations, New specimen types
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What does it mean for a test to not require a new EUA or EUA amendment for modifications under the policy?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Tests with certain modifications do not require a new EUA or amendment but are considered non-authorized tests under guidance policies, separate from the original EUA.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What does it mean for a test to not require a new EUA or EUA amendment for modifications under the policy?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We also clarified in that FAQ that for modifications to an EUA authorized test we have indicated that we don't expect a new EUA or an EUA amendment in certain situations, for modifications. But we clarified that that does mean that the test is not under the original EUA, so it is being offered as a non-authorized test under the policies in the guidance if you follow that pathway.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: EUA modifications, policy guidance clarification
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What guidance is available to distinguish between surveillance, screening, and diagnostic testing for asymptomatic individuals?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA distinguishes surveillance, screening, and diagnostic testing for asymptomatic individuals by their purpose: Surveillance aims to gather population-level information; screening is for identifying individual cases without specific suspicion of infection (e.g., workplace testing); and diagnostic testing is conducted when a specific individual is suspected to have COVID-19.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What guidance is available to distinguish between surveillance, screening, and diagnostic testing for asymptomatic individuals?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We put out the FAQs last week including the FAQ on surveillance testing. We've gotten quite a few questions about the distinction between screening and surveillance and diagnostics testing in terms of testing asymptomatic individuals and testing different populations. So we're working on getting similar information out about that and I wanted to give a quick rundown of how we look at those different terms. So for surveillance, we generally think of that as looking for information at a population of community level. Obviously you'll be testing at an individual level but the purpose of surveillance testing is to gain information at that population level rather than to make individual decisions at an individual person level. Screening on the other hand, is looking for occurrence at the individual level in situations where there might not be a specific reason for that individual to suspect that they would have COVID-19. So where you might be looking at all employees returning to a workplace or all students or faculty coming back to a school. Things like that we would consider to be screening because we are looking to make a decision at the individual level there. And then obviously diagnostic testing also looking for occurrence at the individual level, but that's done when there's a particular reason for that individual to be suspected that they may be infected. And so as we have discussed previously, the tests that we've authorized so far that are indicated for individuals suspected of COVID-19, by a healthcare provider, are generally indicated that that diagnostic testing level where there is a reason to believe that individual may be infected. And any asymptomatic testing is done at the discretion of the ordering healthcare provider.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: Testing categorizations, Asymptomatic testing guidance, Surveillance screening
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-5
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What steps should be taken if a contact is not assigned within two weeks of submitting an EUA application?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Applicants should contact FDA directly if a contact is not assigned within two weeks of submitting an EUA application.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What steps should be taken if a contact is not assigned within two weeks of submitting an EUA application?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So last week I asked folks to contact me if they had not been assigned a contact within two weeks of their EUA submission. That's EUA not a pre-EUA. And it's my understanding that as of today, all of those subject EUA submissions have a contact and still there is the opportunity to reach out to me for EUAs that have not been assigned a contact within two weeks of the date of submission.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: High-priority EUA applications include those with data for point-of-care use, high-throughput automated instruments, and home collection or home testing.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What types of EUA applications are considered high priority for expedited review?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Any applications deemed high priority and have data such as point of care, such as high throughput automated instruments such as, you know, those are - in both those - the situations at the point of care that does require EUA authorization, the high through put should be obviously and that would be a priority. And then also for any home collection where there's data or there's home testing where there is data for us to review. And obviously with home collection and home testing those activities require an EUA before authorization.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE

QA Block 1-8
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What additional information or analyses should developers provide to expedite application evaluation?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Developers should promptly provide any additional information, additional analyses, or new data requested by reviewers to prevent delays in advancing the application.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What additional information or analyses should developers provide to expedite application evaluation?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We would ask that when all reviewers ask for additional information, additional analyses of data that maybe you've already provided, or any new data that may be required to complete a review, we would ask that you please provide that as soon as possible. And this states that many times we are - will be unable to advance the application until we get that requested information. And so we would ask that, you know, that that be addressed as soon as we can, when you get those requests.

VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the FDA's process for publishing NCI test results?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We are obviously now posting all NCI results. Once a decision has been made, a regulatory decision has been made, and once we complete the QC and QA of those reports. So hopefully, soon after the decision we can post those. And as of today, there are results for 21 of the tests that have been submitted to the NCI and they are now public.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: How should developers use updated templates when submitting validation data for FDA review?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends developers use provided templates to guide the validation data submission process. If new elements arise that are not covered in the templates, FDA will focus on providing tailored feedback.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How should developers use updated templates when submitting validation data for FDA review?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We are now also focusing our attention on pre-EUA and where there are templates that we've provided under guidance with recommendations that would apply to a given pre-EUA, we would ask whenever possible, to use those templates to guide the process. If there is something in your development or in your plan that is not in the template as far as there are not recommendations because you have something that's not been covered, we want to in particular, focus our attention on providing developer's that feedback that is not present in guidance or templates. I want to re-review or review as a priority EUA submission and for our review staff, which are quite busy. These are EUAs that have data even if all the studies aren't complete we want to review priority submissions on a rolling basis.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: EUA templates, Validation data, FDA submission process
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-11
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What specific data points should be included in clinical agreement studies for serology validation submissions?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: For clinical agreement studies in serology validation, include data specific to each sample, such as specimen collection date for serology and PCR tests, sample type (e.g., plasma, serum, whole blood, finger prick), days from symptom onset to collection, PCR results, and serology results (separately for IgM and IgG results in separate columns). This helps assess the test's performance.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What specific data points should be included in clinical agreement studies for serology validation submissions?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Specifically regarding the serology template and the information that we will - that we asked for in that template, please remember to provide data that is specific to each sample that's evaluated in your validation studies. These are also called line data. And for clinical agreement study this should include the date the specimen was collected for evaluation with the serology test, the date the specimen was collected for the PCR comparative results, the sample type evaluated plasma, serum, whole blood, finger prick, whatever, and the day from symptom onset to the date the specimen was collected, for evaluation with the serology test, the result of the PCR test and obviously the serology result. If the serology test reports IGM as well as IGG, these results should be provided in separate columns in this line data format. Obviously timing of the various tests and symptom onset is obviously important to understand the true performance of the test. You know, we do look at what are the results after symptom onset; what are the results in days after PCR results? So that helps us to understand the true performance of the test and when a test might turn positive. It also informs future users of that test so that they understand those kinds of performance characteristics.

#### 3. FDA Guidance on Multiplex COVID and Flu Testing

QA Block 3-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can FDA offer insight into how a multiplex assay that detects COVID, flu A, and flu B from a single specimen fits under authorization?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA views multiplex assays detecting COVID, flu A, and flu B as multi-analyte tests and is open to submissions for these. The agency facilitates validation through streamlined processes and requires post-market commitments to move rapidly to traditional review for tests not already authorized.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Okay. It's our understanding that CDC is working on a multiplex assay to detect COVID flu A and flu B from a single specimen. Can FDA offer some insight on how this fits under authorization? What is FDA's view of a test of this type, a test that detects all three versus other tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. So we consider this panel or multi-analyst testing. We have evolved through this pandemic first, focusing on getting assays out that can detect SARS-COV-2 primarily, or antibodies to COVID. The next phase that will begin in the fall, is when we begin to see whether or not there are other respiratory viruses that will be causing symptoms other than SARS-COV-2. NWX-FDA OC And because we anticipate that there will be a really - a huge amount of SARS-COV-2 testing which may make it difficult for labs to test for other respiratory viruses, we are now very open to reviewing submissions that expand beyond SARS-COV-2 to include other respiratory viruses. We have already authorized some who added SARS-COV-2 to an existing panel. Those panels were previously cleared or granted by the agency prior to this pandemic. We now are welcoming all comers for panel and we have for analyzed other than SARS-COV-2 we are taking an efficiently streamlined approach to getting the validation done. It is not at the normal pre-market bar that we set and, you know, had set prior to the pandemic. We do add, for those tests that have not, other than SARS-COV-2 that have not been cleared previously, to the pandemic in lieu of a declaration, we are asking for post-market commitments to rapidly move that Fas soon as possible after authorization through the regular review process. So hopefully that addresses your question.

#### 7. Interpreting Discordant Results in Diagnostic Testing Methods

QA Block 7-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: If there are discordant results between two PCR methods with the same limit of detection or sensitivity, how should results be interpreted?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA advises that for discordant results between PCR methods, tests should be EUA-authorized, patient signs and symptoms considered, and laboratories should evaluate test performance. Discordant results often arise from differing test limits of detection, particularly for low positives.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If there are discordant results between two PCR methods with the same limit of detection or sensitivity, how should results be interpreted?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So there are more than one test out there that we've authorized that have the limitation that negative are presumed negative. And the language is usually conditional that, you know, basically, as clinical signs and symptoms warrant, you may want to reselect to another molecular test. And that applies to the Abbott ID Now. If that - and then, those tests should obviously be EUA authorized. And that would be on the test that I would recommend that you would rely on as far as interpreting those two individual test results. Obviously taking it into the context of the whole patient experience is NWX-FDA OC important as well. No test is perfect. Even the reflex test may have an issue. Yes we are now asking in applications that performance assessments be done relative to another EUA authorized test instead of just contrived samples against the test's own say LOG as required when there were not plentiful samples and when there weren't available other tests in which to make a comparison. So two different tests can very absolutely have different LODs and therefore, potentially for a very low positive, hopefully not commonly, it can have discordant results. And that is a challenge to interpret those results.

QA Block 7-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: With differing levels of operator interaction affecting test quality, how can one determine which test result is more reliable?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA acknowledges that multiple variables, such as operator interaction, sample collection, and test complexity, can influence test quality. Given current emergency conditions and limited data, over-reliance on a single test result is discouraged; instead, performance should be assessed across multiple factors.
VERBATIM QUESTION: With differing levels of operator interaction affecting test quality, how can one determine which test result is more reliable?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. And I just don't know that I can, you know, without knowing the specific tests which is not appropriate for this specific audience and knowing some more details about like, you know, someone might be able with knowledge of both tests, give you a little bit more guidance. The one thing to remember is, you know, for those who really don't know the details of diagnostics testing. There are a lot of variables that can play into the overall performance of the test. And the FDA does its best job to further understand the whole sort of performance, you know, from sample collections all through to at least result reporting from the tests or the instrument that's doing the testing. And that is that it can be the full review the, you know, understood - the results are understood as say positive and negative. And there are many NWX-FDA OC variables along the way. You know, if it's a very manual assay then it obviously can be highly user dependent and which is why we normally ask for precision suitability with multiple uses, multi-day to try to get at whether - but that's not what we ask for under an EUA. And, you know, because we're addressing an emergency situation, we are focused on the immediate public health and so we don't have those same sort of understanding of the data. So, you know, in an emergency situation we all try our best to get optimal results and but, you know, there are variables in sample collections - different people swabbing noses can make a difference. You know, there are these multitude of variables. And then the reaction themselves are highly complex reactions and not a simple, usually not a simple sort of reaction. So all sorts of variables can come in this test - timing, temperature, and things like that.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: For discordant test results involving pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic patients, how should laboratory results be balanced with patient history and presentation?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: For pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic testing, there is insufficient understanding of viral levels and sample types, and even symptomatic patients may yield inconsistent results due to various factors, including the biology of viral shedding. Providers must account for these variables in addition to patient history and presentation.
VERBATIM QUESTION: For discordant test results involving pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic patients, how should laboratory results be balanced with patient history and presentation?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. And, you know, unintelligible and we need to get to further questions and again, pre-symptomatic, asymptomatic testing, we don't have enough understanding of the viral course, the viral levels and all the different sample types. And even with symptomatic patients and the highest performing tests out there, even during the middle of the, you know, the most viral load we already know that even with multiple samples, perhaps even the same test in the same patients, can yield different results just because of some of the variables as I suggested.

VERBATIM QUESTION: How should laboratories approach evaluating the sensitivity and specificity of their own diagnostic tests before using them in clinical settings?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Each lab that brings up a test of their own and gets EUA authorization, or brings in a test from a manufacturer, we want to sort of kick the tires on that test to understand just what they feel is its performance characteristics. When it's EUA-authorized already we're not asking for a full validation. They just want to get their understanding of that. Most labs that do this will come to a fairly rapid assessment of if they have more than one test in their lab, which test might be a little bit more sensitive and which test might - and hopefully both tests are equally specific so they're not either coming up with any false positives.

VERBATIM ANSWER: If developers are, you know, spending a sample from their lab and are assessing some concordance issues, the FDA will look at line listing data as I mentioned, for serology, but also for molecular tests. And having a good understanding of what test was performed, if there are CT results for both, which - what are the CT results for each of the different tests for all the results that are positive for each test. And so we can readily see things, if an occasional sample might be missed in one comparison if all of NWX-FDA OC those are at the low end of the sensitivity range.

The one thing to remember is, you know, for those who really don't know the details of diagnostics testing. There are a lot of variables that can play into the overall performance of the test. And the FDA does its best job to further understand the whole sort of performance, you know, from sample collections all through to at least result reporting from the tests or the instrument that's doing the testing. And that is that it can be the full review the, you know, understood - the results are understood as say positive and negative. And there are many NWX-FDA OC variables along the way. You know, if it's a very manual assay then it obviously can be highly user dependent and which is why we normally ask for precision suitability with multiple uses, multi-day to try to get at whether - but that's not what we ask for under an EUA. And, you know, because we're addressing an emergency situation, we are focused on the immediate public health and so we don't have those same sort of understanding of the data. So, you know, in an emergency situation we all try our best to get optimal results and but, you know, there are variables in sample collections - different people swabbing noses can make a difference. You know, there are these multitude of variables. And then the reaction themselves are highly complex reactions and not a simple, usually not a simple sort of reaction. So all sorts of variables can come in this test - timing, temperature, and things like that. So we assess the overall performance of tests in this emergency. And I would urge not over reliance on any one particular result, whether it's positive or negative. And that's generally the case in normal clinical practice. Yes, we would love to always rely on a test result as being the absolute truth. That's unfortunately, you know, an objective that is really sometimes if not most of the time, hard to achieve and you could absolutely count on one single result, whether it's within this emergency, during this emergency or after this emergency.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What factors should developers consider when evaluating the user-dependent variables of a manual assay under EUA authorization?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: For EUA authorization, developers should focus on overall test performance, from sample collection to result reporting, understanding that manual assays are highly user-dependent. The FDA does not request comprehensive data under EUA due to emergency prioritization, but emphasizes optimizing test outcomes while considering variables like user handling, timing, and temperature.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: How should developers address discrepancies in low-positive samples observed during sensitivity comparisons between tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends performance assessments relative to another EUA-authorized test rather than solely relying on contrived samples. Developers and labs should evaluate comparative sensitivity and specificity to determine which test is more reliable for low-positive samples.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How should developers address discrepancies in low-positive samples observed during sensitivity comparisons between tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes we are now asking in applications that performance assessments be done relative to another EUA authorized test instead of just contrived samples against the test's own say LOG as required when there were not plentiful samples and when there weren't available other tests in which to make a comparison. So two different tests can very absolutely have different LODs and therefore, potentially for a very low positive, hopefully not commonly, it can have discordant results. And that is a challenge to interpret those results. Each lab that brings up a test of their own and gets EUA authorization, or brings in a test from a manufacturer, we want to sort of kick the tires on that test to understand just what they feel is its performance characteristics. When it's EUA-authorized already we're not asking for a full validation. They just want to get their understanding of that. Most labs that do this will come to a fairly rapid assessment of if they have more than one test in their lab, which test might be a little bit more sensitive and which test might - and hopefully both tests are equally specific so they're not either coming up with any false positives. And therefore if they have that understanding of which test might be a little bit more sensitive, they would assess that that is the test that they might rely on more readily than another one.

#### 10. Combining PCR and Antibody Testing for EUA Submissions

QA Block 10-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Would we have to have a separate submission for total antibody or could we fold that in with IGM and IGG?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: For testing involving IGM, IGG, or a total antibody, FDA requires data supporting individual or combined performance characteristics, depending on how results are reported, as outlined in serology guidance.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Would we have to have a separate submission for total antibody or could we fold that in with IGM and IGG?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So, first of all, I refer folks to the CDC guidance document on serology testing and in that I believe it says that we don't have any specific recommendation about which isotype and which type of serology test that the developer uses. It may say in there that IGM, I forget the details, may not have as much value as IGG, the total or pan. NWX-FDA OC The performance characteristic is that we expect to see in our template, and we're in the process of updating our template for serology to address anybody who is interested in IGM only, just as an aside. And if somebody wants to come in with, you know, a pan or a total then we would assess that depending on how results are reported out. So if someone has a test and it separately currently reports out IGM and IGG results, we would ask for data to support each independent parameter and look at the performance characteristics of it. We would also assess the overall performance characteristics with the combined sensitivity, the combined - and the combined specificity. If results of IGM and IGG individually, are shielded from the user and something - and it's from a different, you know, a different assessment is made about a positive and negative then we wouldn't be looking at individual data.

VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. If you want to make the statement in the instructions for use for your particular, you know, there's one device in the combining the testing and the results, then we'll look at that. If you have two different applications in an EUA authorization and you want to combine them to make and additional assessment on patient status and your claims for COVID-19, then yes, the claims about the combination of the test would be reviewed. It - potentially if there are EUA authorizations for both already for one pathway, it could simply be an amendment to both, with the data and updated labeling of both. Unless you would have package the things together and send us the list together, which may not be the most efficient. So I think any subsequent questions are probably best addressed specifically, to the EUA template email address, or one of the other reviewers or contact that you have been given for your EUAs. Okay?

Sometimes it's the only thing that's available to a developer. I've had, prior to my FDA experience, I had that very same experience and we were able to go on and get a PMA approval, using RUO instruments because it was the only thing that was available. So the FDA in all situations takes into consideration these things. And there are ways to mitigate risks, you know, to RUO labeled components and instruments.
