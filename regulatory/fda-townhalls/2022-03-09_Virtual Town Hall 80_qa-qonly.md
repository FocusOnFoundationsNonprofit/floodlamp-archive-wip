#### 1. Updates on FDA's COVID-19 Diagnostic Test Guidance

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What updates has the FDA made recently to the serology guidance for COVID-19 tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA has updated its website with serology guidance, including recommendations for traceability to an international standard for quantitative and semi-quantitative tests. Additionally, the FDA states current antibody tests should not be used to determine protection from COVID-19 due to insufficient data on immunity thresholds.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What updates has the FDA made recently to the serology guidance for COVID-19 tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So we did update the FDA's website and some of the website's updates are regarding serology, one of them is fairly straightforward and providing recommendations for traceability to an international standard. If someone is developing a quantitative test or wants to trace their semi-quants or other tests to international standard. And then also we continue to get questions about whether or not SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests should be used to assess whether a person is protected from COVID, and the current FDA thinking is still that no, the current antibody tests should not be used for this purpose. We are still awaiting sufficient data to establish thresholds for immunity and protection and should we have those, and when we have those, that will be a different situation entirely.

#### 10. CLIA Requirements for POC and OTC Device Submissions

QA Block 10-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can an investigational use device for antigen point-of-care testing be used at a site that does not have a CLIA waiver?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends testing investigational antigen point-of-care (POC) devices at CLIA-certified sites to evaluate performance in realistic, busy clinical environments. This has been their longstanding guidance.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can an investigational use device for antigen point-of-care testing be used at a site that does not have a CLIA waiver?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So that's not necessarily what we're recommending here because we're trying to look at performance within an actual CLIA site. And with the kind of personnel that you see at a CLIA site, presumably a busy clinical practice, where the staff there are juggling seeing patients, taking care of those patients, and doing any CLIA waived tests and that that's the scenario that we're trying to-- that we're recommending. So that we know, in that busy environment, can they get an accurate test result? And I'll allow a follow up question there. But that has been our recommendation for a long time now.

QA Block 10-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: For a POC site that collects swabs at a drive-thru and performs PCR testing in a laboratory nearby, should the drive-thru site have a CLIA certificate?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The drive-thru site should have a CLIA certificate if it conducts CLIA lab testing. If it only collects swabs and sends them to a central lab, it may not need one. FDA recommends submitting a pre-EUA to confirm the study setup.
VERBATIM QUESTION: For a POC site that collects swabs at a drive-thru and performs PCR testing in a laboratory nearby, should the drive-thru site have a CLIA certificate?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah so the comparator testing, that's pretty standard that you'd have to transport that somewhere else. Again we're looking for a standard POC site so, Kris, you may be able to add on to this, but I think if you're going to have multiple sites and one of those sites is such a site that's fine. But the drive-thru site should have, first of all should have a CLIA certificate if they're doing CLIA lab testing. So unless they're doing just collection and sending to a central facility but if it's going to be a nonstandard point-of-care testing site that you want to use, or at least one site that you want to use, I would recommend you submit a pre-EUA that includes your clinical study design and your method for testing, and verify with the FDA that that's acceptable.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: If submitting for an OTC antigen test and also wanting a POC claim, is an additional study needed with the intended POC user and environment?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: No additional study is needed for a POC claim if you conduct over-the-counter studies. If the test works for home users, it is expected to also work in POC settings.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If submitting for an OTC antigen test and also wanting a POC claim, is an additional study needed with the intended POC user and environment?
VERBATIM ANSWER: No. So we'd recommended a long time ago that those that are ultimately interested in going over-the-counter, they just do the over-the-counter studies. They don't have to do-- there are all the flex studies but they don't have to do-- we don't recommend doing clinical studies within a point-of- care if you're going to do the home user study. If something works well in home user hands, we expect to work well in point-of-care user hands. And that just comes with it, you don't necessarily have to have a point-of-care version of the test but you can have a professional use of the test and you don't need any additional clinical study data to support the point-of-care in that case.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: In the scenario of submitting for an OTC antigen test and a POC claim, should the intended use state 'CLIA waived' or just 'point-of-care environment'?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The intended use's wording depends on the desired application. Professional use kits generally differ from over-the-counter kits, leading to separate authorizations in most cases.
VERBATIM QUESTION: In the scenario of submitting for an OTC antigen test and a POC claim, should the intended use state 'CLIA waived' or just 'point-of-care environment'?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So it depends on you and what you want and typically a professional use kit is going to have a lot more tests than an over-to-counter kit, so you would, in all likelihood, have two separate authorizations with one submission.

#### 12. Determining Shelf Life for Emergency Use Authorization Submissions

QA Block 12-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How is the validation approach for determining the shelf life where the expiration date is being monitored?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA provides guidance through templates on their website for expiration dating experiments. Developers should plan stability tests to extend real-time expiration dates and submit updates for authorization. FDA may allow expired kits in the field to remain usable based on provided data.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How is the validation approach for determining the shelf life where the expiration date is being monitored?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So there's different expiration dating experiments that can be done. I think our templates that are on the FDA website speak to some of these. You really want to start with the target date for your unopened kits at least for ultimately where you want your expiration dating to be. Let's just say you want it to be two years for molecular and/or rapid antigen tests or a serology test, then you plan your expiration dating experiments out beyond that date. You want to go one time point beyond those dates. And then there's been a lot of interest to seeing date extension for expiration dating for COVID tests, so that especially when there's drop off in cases, perhaps only temporarily, product doesn't go bad in the intervening period, and labs have stocks and individuals that have stocks of tests.

QA Block 12-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What specific details do the FDA templates provide regarding expiration dating experiments?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA templates provide guidance on planning expiration dating experiments, including setting target dates for unopened kits and conducting tests beyond those dates. They encourage real-time and accelerated stability testing, with updates submitted for FDA review. Developers are advised to extend expiration dates and submit supplements. FDA supports using authorized kits with extended expiration dates.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What specific details do the FDA templates provide regarding expiration dating experiments?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So there's different expiration dating experiments that can be done. I think our templates that are on the FDA website speak to some of these. You really want to start with the target date for your unopened kits at least for ultimately where you want your expiration dating to be. Let's just say you want it to be two years for molecular and/or rapid antigen tests or a serology test, then you plan your expiration dating experiments out beyond that date. You want to go one time point beyond those dates. And then there's been a lot of interest to seeing date extension for expiration dating for COVID tests, so that especially when there's drop off in cases, perhaps only temporarily, product doesn't go bad in the intervening period, and labs have stocks and individuals that have stocks of tests. So we are encouraging that all developers extend their dates. And so in the early months you may want to have more time points.

#### 13. EUA Timeline and Review Process Overview

QA Block 13-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is a typical timeline for an EUA once in the active review process?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA does not provide typical timeline information for EUAs. While submissions meeting priorities with clear and complete data can be processed quickly, delays can happen due to back-and-forth if questions arise.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is a typical timeline for an EUA once in the active review process?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So that's typically not information that we give out. We're still receiving upwards of about 100 original EUAs and pre-EUAs a month, so we remain very busy. The surge has largely returned to their original spots within the Center, but we have been able to hire very well through the pandemic with additional funding provided by Congress. So the DMD Division, the Microbiology Division, is substantially larger than it was pre-pandemic. And so we do have our priorities that were listed at the November 15, 2021 guidance update. You can see what those priorities are. If you meet those priorities and your submission is excellent, meaning that the data support the test authorization and the data is presented in a way that's easily understood and complete and all the protocols are provided, that you used, and they're able to be understood, those submissions go through very quickly. Sometimes very quickly, even now. However if we have questions, that can involve a lot of back and forth. And that's going to extend. So those submissions that are well done in all aspects really benefit from that focus to making sure that it's a well-done submission.

#### 14. Over-the-Counter Antigen Test Swabbing and Comparator Protocols

QA Block 14-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: For over-the-counter rapid antigen tests, if we conduct a PCR test using anterior nasal swabs and also use anterior nasal swabs for the antigen test, would randomization between these swab types be required?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The comparator test must be EUA-authorized and highly sensitive. Developers should validate the anterior nasal swab for the comparator test and consult FDA for study design approval. Randomization involves having the user perform the OTC test first, wait 15 minutes, and then perform the comparator test.
VERBATIM QUESTION: For over-the-counter rapid antigen tests, if we conduct a PCR test using anterior nasal swabs and also use anterior nasal swabs for the antigen test, would randomization between these swab types be required?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So first of all, the sample type for the comparator test has to be authorized. It has to be an EUA-authorized test to be used as a comparator and we want it, we recommend it to be a high sensitivity. So we are recommending that the developers do check with the FDA to make sure that the particular molecular comparator test is of sufficient sensitivity for your study. That's a pretty easy direct question if you're not going to have any other questions that can probably be handled by an email rather than a pre-EUA. And then if the antigen test, if you want to go with an anterior nasal swab, then as long as the anterior nasal swab is acceptable and validated and authorized for the molecular comparator, comparing the two is just fine. It may be clear to you already but sometimes it's not clear. And then there are different approaches to this as far as you can-- oh randomize, this is an OTC test, so we don't like to have the users biased, at least immediately biased. I mean most everybody has had some sort of swab done on them but sometimes they forget. And we're really evaluating, for an OTC test, you know how does that user approach that test with just the instructions that are provided with the test without any help. And so the comparator test of swabbing could give them a little bit of education right before they do the antigen test. So the best situation here that we recommend, if you want to do something other than this, then I would recommend that you submit a pre-EUA with your clinical study design. There may be other questions you have. Is to first give the candidate test to the subject, and have them do that, and then have a short washout period of, we would recommend 15 minutes, and then you come back with the comparator test. So since most of these tests, if the user goes ahead self-swabs, runs the test, it's going to be at least 15 minutes already. So it's really as soon as they're done performing that OTC antigen test, you can then direct them into getting their comparator test swab done.

#### 15. Approaches to Enrichment in Antigen Test Clinical Trials

QA Block 15-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can you provide an example of an acceptable enrichment approach for OTC self-testing antigen tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA emphasizes the need to avoid bias in over-the-counter antigen test studies. Testing should focus on symptomatic individuals, and users should not know their results with a comparator test. An example includes seeking local IRB approval to bring participants back for results to eliminate bias; both positive and negative participants can be included in the study. Submit proposals via pre-EUA discussions.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can you provide an example of an acceptable enrichment approach for OTC self-testing antigen tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah so a lot of this has to be individualized because there's specifics that are important. What we want to do is eliminate bias, and enhancing the performance of the test through that bias, so since this is an over-the-counter antigen test it's really important that the user doesn't know the results of-- it's important that they don't know whether they're positive or negative with the test of record or comparator test. So first of all, antigen tests are directed at symptomatic people, so obviously someone has symptoms and can define those symptoms, that can help you enrich. If there's a way that you can have a quick-- I think it's probably good for you to come in with a pre-EUA and suggest some things. But those are the important elements, and it all depends on what the comparator test is, how quickly you can, or the test of record, if it's the same thing, as compared to how quickly you know that result, and then what's ethical and when you provide that result to the user, relative to when they are tested. One possibility is, if the local IRB would approve, is that you bring people back to give them their results of their testing. If they, at the time of the original testing, say they're willing to be part of a study, and you bring back both people who tested positive on the test of record, as well as tested negative so there isn't a bias there. And so they don't know whether they were positive with the comparator test or not. But that's just one idea, it's not necessarily the recommended approach, it's just to get your creativity going here on how you might do it and to lay out the importance of avoiding bias.

Approaches must consider comparator type, timing of results, ethical considerations, and seek IRB approval if needed.

VERBATIM QUESTION: What elements should be included in pre-EUA submissions proposing enrichment approaches for OTC antigen tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah so a lot of this has to be individualized because there's specifics that are important. What we want to do is eliminate bias, and enhancing the performance of the test through that bias, so since this is an over-the-counter antigen test it's really important that the user doesn't know the results of-- it's important that they don't know whether they're positive or negative with the test of record or comparator test. So first of all, antigen tests are directed at symptomatic people, so obviously someone has symptoms and can define those symptoms, that can help you enrich. If there's a way that you can have a quick-- I think it's probably good for you to come in with a pre-EUA and suggest some things. But those are the important elements, and it all depends on what the comparator test is, how quickly you can, or the test of record, if it's the same thing, as compared to how quickly you know that result, and then what's ethical and when you provide that result to the user, relative to when they are tested. One possibility is, if the local IRB would approve, is that you bring people back to give them their results of their testing. If they, at the time of the original testing, say they're willing to be part of a study, and you bring back both people who tested positive on the test of record, as well as tested negative so there isn't a bias there. And so they don't know whether they were positive with the comparator test or not. But that's just one idea, it's not necessarily the recommended approach, it's just to get your creativity going here on how you might do it and to lay out the importance of avoiding bias.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends sequencing within the United States using a well-validated method but will allow sequence data submission later if it delays your application, provided samples are collected properly.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can sequencing samples collected in the United States be processed outside the United States?
VERBATIM ANSWER: OK, well there should be plenty of opportunities to get a sequence within the United States. We do ask that it's been a well-validated method of sequence analysis. And then as long as you collect, as long as the study is conducted when omicron is essentially 100%, which it still is, in a region of the country or world where you, well in this case, the country recommended, then we don't need to see the sequence information at the submission. That can be verified later. So we don't want to hold up the submission unnecessarily if the sequence information isn't back, as long as you've collected the samples. If you haven't even started your study and you start your study now, it's mostly going to be omicron. We just want to verify that at least 10 of those pre-authorization are omicron.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Is it sufficient to have the final instructions for use for the patients to go through the testing, wait 15 minutes, have a washout, and sample one for the comparator test as a part of the usability study?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah, so first of all, collection of the comparator test you can do exactly as you described. I think I mentioned that earlier on this call. Where you give them the kit and current instructions and they run the test without help, and then as soon as they're done obviously you can collect a competitor sample and not bias that. If you don't think you have locked down instructions in your usability study creates questions about whether you should change your instruction. I mean that's really, could be material. And so its why traditionally, people do usability studies ahead of the clinical study. Because if they make any changes there's no impact on the clinical study. If developers have high confidence there doesn't need to be a change that they have their protocol and their test locked down, it's going to perform well, then there's probably low risk and you save a lot of time if you combine things. But if you really want to know, is the test easy to use and will it, with the current instructions work, it may be best to do the usability study ahead of the clinical study.

REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 22-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: If instructions for use are changed based on a questionnaire, does that warrant conducting another usability study?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends doing usability studies before clinical studies to avoid potential impacts from instruction changes. If instructions aren't finalized or require changes, conducting a usability study first is advised.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If instructions for use are changed based on a questionnaire, does that warrant conducting another usability study?
VERBATIM ANSWER: If you don't think you have locked down instructions in your usability study creates questions about whether you should change your instruction. I mean that's really, could be material. And so its why traditionally, people do usability studies ahead of the clinical study. Because if they make any changes there's no impact on the clinical study. If developers have high confidence there doesn't need to be a change that they have their protocol and their test locked down, it's going to perform well, then there's probably low risk and you save a lot of time if you combine things. But if you really want to know, is the test easy to use and will it, with the current instructions work, it may be best to do the usability study ahead of the clinical study.

QA Block 22-7
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the risks associated with not locking down instructions before conducting clinical or usability studies?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: If instructions are not finalized during a usability study and changes are needed, it could materially impact results. Therefore, usability studies are typically conducted before clinical ones to avoid such risks.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the risks associated with not locking down instructions before conducting clinical or usability studies?
VERBATIM ANSWER: If you don't think you have locked down instructions in your usability study creates questions about whether you should change your instruction. I mean that's really, could be material. And so its why traditionally, people do usability studies ahead of the clinical study. Because if they make any changes there's no impact on the clinical study.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does FDA still intend to provide feedback on the manufacturer's program for reporting and labeling modifications related to variant monitoring?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA has a backlog of files, which might delay feedback on the monitoring programs. Manufacturers should focus on reporting only if changes in reactivity are detected. If no changes are observed, no updates are necessary. FDA will also monitor and contact manufacturers if needed.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does FDA still intend to provide feedback on the manufacturer's program for reporting and labeling modifications related to variant monitoring?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah so we do have a rather large backlog of these particular files, so you may have not heard back from the review team yet on your supplement. I think we really only are interested if you detect changes in reactivity. If you continue to monitor the publicly available databases and there's no change, there's no reason to report. We will of course, be doing the same thing on our side and if there is some changes that we detect, we will likely reach out to you as well. So I would just say, keep doing your typical monitoring that you are doing and if there's no signal that things are changing then certainly we want to keep those reporting activities at a minimum.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the requirements for a molecular comparator test to be considered suitable for a study?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The molecular comparator test must be EUA-authorized, have high sensitivity, and be confirmed by developers in consultation with the FDA for sufficient sensitivity for the study.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the requirements for a molecular comparator test to be considered suitable for a study?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So first of all, the sample type for the comparator test has to be authorized. It has to be an EUA-authorized test to be used as a comparator and we want it, we recommend it to be a high sensitivity. So we are recommending that the developers do check with the FDA to make sure that the particular molecular comparator test is of sufficient sensitivity for your study. That's a pretty easy direct question if you're not going to have any other questions that can probably be handled by an email rather than a pre-EUA.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is a washout period required between administering an over-the-counter antigen test and the comparator test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: A 15-minute washout period is recommended between administering an over-the-counter antigen test and the comparator test.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is a washout period required between administering an over-the-counter antigen test and the comparator test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So the best situation here that we recommend, if you want to do something other than this, then I would recommend that you submit a pre-EUA with your clinical study design. There may be other questions you have. Is to first give the candidate test to the subject, and have them do that, and then have a short washout period of, we would recommend 15 minutes, and then you come back with the comparator test. So since most of these tests, if the user goes ahead self-swabs, runs the test, it's going to be at least 15 minutes already. So it's really as soon as they're done performing that OTC antigen test, you can then direct them into getting their comparator test swab done.
