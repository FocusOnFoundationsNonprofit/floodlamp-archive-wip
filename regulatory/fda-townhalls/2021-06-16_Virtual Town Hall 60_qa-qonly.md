#### 1. FDA Updates on SARS-CoV-2 Testing and Prioritization

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What factors are being studied to determine how serology tests measure immunity or protection?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is awaiting results from government-sponsored immunity and protection studies to identify reliable factors for determining immunity, such as specific antibody levels. Developers can perform their own studies, but large studies are usually required.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What factors are being studied to determine how serology tests measure immunity or protection?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We've had numerous inquiries about using serology to measure immunity and/or protection either from natural infection or following vaccines. This is a hot topic for our office. We are awaiting data from U.S. Government-sponsored immunity and protection studies to understand what are the factors that determine and can be relied on to make these assessments. You know, sponsors, test developers are free to generate that kind of information, although, it seems like it would take fairly large studies to see what a certain level of antibodies, for example, offers in the way of immunity because you are looking at outcomes. So, you know, as soon as we have definitive information about how to measure immunity and protection, we will be able to provide some more help to developers as far as what our recommendations are for validation of serology tests for this purpose.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Serology testing, Immunity measurements, Study requirements
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How can test developers independently generate data on the effectiveness of antibody levels in providing immunity?

CLARIFIED ANSWER: The pre-EUA process is optional and intended to align FDA's advice with developers' efforts, focusing on unique elements not covered by existing templates or prior public decisions.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the FDA's recommendation for developers using the pre-EUA process?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So we - you know, the pre-EUA process is not a required process. And it's designed to try to be helpful and make sure that we're aligned on what the recommendations are from the FDA. So test developers can, you know, not do something and find out it doesn't quite work. Developers are always able to go ahead and submit and do the work and submit their EUAs. However, there are certain things that, you know, that may not be known. So we really are hoping only to advise your pre-EUAs, those things that are unique and different from what are present in the template. So, you know, look at our prior decisions. Look at - that are public. And look at, you know, our templates. And hopefully, that meets the lion's share of pre-EUA requests.

QA Block 1-6
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How does the FDA plan to address the significant backlog in the pre-EUA process?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is addressing the pre-EUA backlog by maintaining efficiency despite reduced staffing, prioritizing cases aligned with its templates, and advising developers to align submissions with public prior decisions and existing guidance. The pre-EUA process is optional and meant to help clarify unique submissions.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How does the FDA plan to address the significant backlog in the pre-EUA process?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We are still receiving a high volume of submissions for COVID. And however, we are keeping up with the volume even with reducing the surge, mainly to pre-surge, almost to pre-surge level as far as staffing goes. But we are staying ahead of it. We are closing out our files more quickly than we are receiving them. But there is still a bit of a backlog. In particular, the pre-EUA backlog is not insignificant. And Toby and I have been making recommendations on recent calls for certain callers to check-in through the pre-EUA process. So we - you know, the pre-EUA process is not a required process. And it's designed to try to be helpful and make sure that we're aligned on what the recommendations are from the FDA.

QA Block 2-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is it true that an over-the-counter molecular test should not include a hazardous substance?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA prefers that no hazardous materials are used in at-home tests, but recognizes that developers may need to include such substances in diluted forms. The FDA conducts toxicology reviews and encourages submission of documentation confirming whether chemicals used are hazardous at the concentrations in question. Mitigations like labeling and safety measures are considered when necessary.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is it true that an over-the-counter molecular test should not include a hazardous substance?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Oh yes. So we have seen the use of hazardous chemicals in the development of certain tests. These typically fall into three different categories or uses. One is preservatives to prevent microbial growth in buffers. There are materials that are used to lyse cells or virus. And then there are materials to stabilize RNA. And as we began authorizing at-home tests and at-home collection devices, it became clear to us that this was an important review for the FDA to do. We would prefer that no hazardous materials enter the home. And if there are potential hazardous materials that they're of the type, that a dilute version of them as is the case in many examples, for example, detergents are usually in very low percent. It's only in high concentrations of detergent that, you know, say it splashes into the eye or could potentially cause harm to the patient. Others, some preservatives such that are being used, you know, are potentially hazardous substances. So we, in an effort to make testing as widely available, we know that developers sometimes cannot avoid some of these components. So we do a Hazardous Chemical Substance Toxicology Review. We encourage developers to, you know, to submit documentation that says, you know, whether or not the chemicals that are in their test are hazardous, especially at the concentrations that are being used in the test. So a number of these reviews have happened. And we look at. And some of them have turned out to be safe to use without special considerations, mainly because they're fairly dilute. But we continue this review. And we ask that developers send MSDS sheets, literature studies. You know, in particular, the literature studies look at lower concentrations of some of these chemicals. MSDS largely looks at the undiluted forms and in many cases, the MSDS's are not appropriate for full hazard analysis. We look at, you know, if there is something that still remains in a range where it may not be entirely safe, we look at other mitigation, such as wearing gloves or eye protection. We prefer not to have to go that route. We also look at labeling, very strong labeling. So, yes, we would prefer that non-toxic materials are used. We know that in the effort to get tests out there that it may not be possible to move away from them at this time. So we just look for mitigations. And we look at the available data to make the best decisions.

QA Block 4-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the FDA have a preference on the type of banked samples to use to supplement prospectively collected positive samples for molecular diagnostic tests, particularly for point of care tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA prefers samples, whether banked or fresh, to match the type intended for use with the device. For example, anterior nasal swabs should be used if anterior nasal swabs are claimed. Nasopharyngeal swabs, considered the most challenging matrix, can also serve as a comparator and may support claims for other upper respiratory specimen types.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA have a preference on the type of banked samples to use to supplement prospectively collected positive samples for molecular diagnostic tests, particularly for point of care tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So generally, we do want to see samples, whether banked or fresh tested that match the sample type that you intend to claim for your device.

#### 5. Understanding Antibody Tests for Immunity and Vaccine Effectiveness

QA Block 5-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is expected from the antibody test regarding information about immunity to a vaccine?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA agrees with CDC that serology tests should not be used for routine diagnosis. Regarding immunity testing, future advancements might help determine specific antibody levels or types that correlate with protection, such as preventing reinfection or severe outcomes. Vaccine studies are helpful for tracking immune responses over time to correlate with outcomes like illness prevention.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is expected from the antibody test regarding information about immunity to a vaccine?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. So first, to clarify the first point. Yes, the FDA agrees with what you represented from the CDC that the serology test should not be used for - routinely for diagnosis. There are some situations, of course, lingering infection where virus may be negative. And clinicians want to know, particularly in long COVID situations, and you want to know if they've ever been exposed. And clinicians can order those for their purposes. Regarding immunity and protection, of course, this isn't a diagnostic test. This isn't saying you are currently infected with SARS. What it's more designed to do, should we get there with this virus and there's every belief that we will get there. Our science will advance to the point where we understand what it means to be immune to SARS. That is, what level perhaps of antibody or what presence of different types of antibodies like neutralizing antibodies correlate with outcomes that's showing that folks with a certain level of antibody or type of antibody do not get re-infected or if they get infected, it's asymptomatic. So those just - those studies require close observation of patients. And oftentimes, you know, it might be the best study conditions to monitor patients who have received the different types of vaccines and then monitoring antibody production after the vaccines and the levels. You know, the obvious reason to use vaccine studies is that we know exactly when these patients have been vaccinated. So we know the time course of the immune response and antibody levels and we can track those over time and correlate them with outcomes. That is, do they avoid getting sick? Do they avoid hospitalization? Is death from COVID prevented? Those are the important questions to ask. And until we know the correlation or say, the quantitative level of antibodies with outcomes, we - it's really hard just, you know, to say what a given antibody response means.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Do we have any tests for other infectious diseases that are approved by the FDA that work similarly?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA has fully authorized serology tests for infectious diseases like rubella, measles, and mumps, which are quantitative tests that help determine immunity based on standards of correlative protection.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Do we have any tests for other infectious diseases that are approved by the FDA that work similarly?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. We have fully authorized some such serology tests for a number of vaccines and authorized, you know, them in a way that these are usually quantitative tests that can help clinicians make the determination on whether a person has, you know, achieved and/or maintains immunity for them. So, let's see, it looks like rubella, measle, mumps are examples traceable to a standard that is established as a correlative protection.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: Lower priority applications are being reviewed now as backlog clears, but the standards and priorities remain the same as for higher priority applications.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are low priority applications being reviewed with a different standard than applications considered high priority last year?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So there were definitely some lower priority applications that were put on pause and were assigned to some of our support staff to communicate with developers. As our reviewers have completed the work on the higher priority applications, there has been an opportunity to go back to some of the lower priority applications. The standards are still the same. The priorities are still the same. It's just as we've been able to work through the backlog, we are working in some cases into lower priority submissions now. Now many of these were able to be marketed through the notification pathways. And since that pathway was open to them and they were deemed to be a lower priority, that's why they were paused. But we're going back to them now. There really is no different standard. We, you know, we do - when the applications come in, we do a quick assessment. And we look and see what it is in order to prioritize it. Then we also look at whether there are any obvious concerns about the application. But we are not doing a complete review of those applications until it is assigned to a reviewer. And at that point, they do a complete review. And if there are issues, they will reach out to the developer and state those issues clearly.

VERBATIM ANSWER: And so yes, our thinking sometimes evolves here. And this just reflects an ongoing evolution. And we - you know, in the case of panel tests that we've not reviewed before for EUA, we do have flexibility. So, for example, banked samples can be used for - you know, and we know that there's very little flu circulating right now. And so we've made good use of bank samples. And those bank samples may not - they may not have, you know, a good distribution, say, of positivity and that's something that we had hoped to see. So but, so we haven't in prior situations asked about that. So but we do have the flexibility to put in some commitments post-market.

#### 12. FDA Reference Panel and Inclusivity for Testing

QA Block 12-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is the FDA reference panel required only for molecular tests or is there also a panel for antigen tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA does not have a reference panel for antigen tests, only for molecular tests, due to the challenges in producing a universal panel for antigens.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is the FDA reference panel required only for molecular tests or is there also a panel for antigen tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So for - first of all, for the Reference Panel, so we do not have a Reference Panel for antigen test. We have one for molecular. And there were various reasons for that, largely because producing something that will work uniformly for antigen test is a little bit more difficult. And, you know, so there are thoughts about what we need to do there.

REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 12-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is the inclusivity analytical sensitivity performance study required only for molecular tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Inclusivity analytical sensitivity studies are primarily done for molecular tests using in silico methods. However, FDA expects antigen test developers to monitor potential impacts of mutations and test those impacts using wet lab methods instead of in silico analysis.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is the inclusivity analytical sensitivity performance study required only for molecular tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: As far as inclusivity goes so, you know, we largely have relied on in silico inclusivity testing for molecular tests. And that's fairly straightforward for molecular tests because, you know, you have primers and your probes and you can do homology analysis to the known mutations and variants out there and detect if there's anything of significance that would lead to a false negative. That sort of in silico analysis is at best very challenging for antigen tests. You know, we are asking all developers, serology, antigen, and molecular to - through guidance that we issued on this to be monitoring indications and determine whether - when a situation exists where there may be an impact and they need to do more work. And more work can involve getting a hold of through various means and be able to test for mutations and variants that might impact the test performance. For developers who are still developing their tests, we ask them to do the same thing. And antigen tests would fall into that category. So antigen tests should know, you know, which antigen was used to generate their antibody or antibodies and epitope mapping information as well for those antibodies so that they can look at the sequence data. Translate it to amino acid and see were there are any potential impacts. And if there are potential impacts, there are various ways to test in vitro the impact of those mutations on antigen tests. And we would ask the developers for those mutations or variants that may impact their test to be able to do that testing. That would be wet testing, rather than in silico testing.
