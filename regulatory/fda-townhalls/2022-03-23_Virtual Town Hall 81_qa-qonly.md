#### 2. Conversion of EUAs to Full FDA Authorizations

QA Block 2-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the specific steps required to transition a COVID-19 test from an EUA to a full 510k authorization?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Molecular tests can follow a 510k process for point-of-care use, while others may require the de novo pathway. Recommendations for submitting full authorization packages are consistent, and sponsors are encouraged to use the FDA's Pre-Sub and Q-Sub pathways for support during the transition process.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the specific steps required to transition a COVID-19 test from an EUA to a full 510k authorization?
VERBATIM ANSWER: All molecular test follow-ons will, for point of care laboratory use, can be handled through the 510k process. Where that's not available, then de novo pathway is the process. And for the first successful submitter, all subsequent submitters will then be authorized under the 510k pathway. ... The first one in for antigen will use molecular comparators, and the second one that's a 510k will also use molecular comparators. So we are able to provide recommendations, at least through the Pre-Sub and Q-Sub process for COVID test full authorization conversions.

REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 2-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: When should developers begin considering the conversion from an EUA to a full authorization for their tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends that developers begin considering the conversion from an EUA to full authorization during their EUA studies, as it is more efficient to continue studies for full authorization once EUA data is collected. It is not required, but now is an opportune time given the stage of the pandemic.
VERBATIM QUESTION: When should developers begin considering the conversion from an EUA to a full authorization for their tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: I would say also that, especially those that are planning to do EUA studies now, whether it be antigen, molecular, or serology-- well into the third year of the pandemic, if you're doing that now, presumably you want to stay on the market for a long time. And therefore, I would recommend that you, while you're doing your EUA studies, consider continuing those studies after you get enough data to submit for an EUA and collect for the full authorization. It just seems relatively efficient for you to do that, rather than start something, stop it, and then have to restart later. So something to consider-- it's something that I would recommend, but it's certainly not a requirement. It just seems to make sense at this time in the pandemic on when we're encouraging all EUAs to go ahead and perform their conversion studies. Alright, and there's no time like the present to get that started.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: EUA to full authorization, COVID-19 diagnostic tests, FDA study recommendations
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 2-5
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the reasons for recommending developers to continue EUA studies into full authorization studies without interruption?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends continuing EUA studies into full authorization studies to maintain market presence efficiently, avoiding the need to stop and restart studies. This approach aligns with the current stage of the pandemic.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the reasons for recommending developers to continue EUA studies into full authorization studies without interruption?
VERBATIM ANSWER: I would say also that, especially those that are planning to do EUA studies now, whether it be antigen, molecular, or serology-- well into the third year of the pandemic, if you're doing that now, presumably you want to stay on the market for a long time.

VERBATIM QUESTION: How might a potential resurgence in COVID-19 cases impact the data collection process for EUA or full authorization submissions?
VERBATIM ANSWER: In all likelihood, we may see a slight resurgence in COVID in the coming weeks and months, so the number of positives should increase. If old patterns hold, we're seeing resurgent omicron BA.2 in Europe. And we're just anticipating, because of past historical patterns, that we'll see that here too.

#### 7. Evaluating COVID-19 Tests for Stealth Omicron Variant

QA Block 7-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Do test developers need to evaluate the stealth omicron variant?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Yes, FDA expects test developers to evaluate all relevant variants, including BA.2 (also referred to as the stealth omicron variant), as it accounted for about 23% of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. during early March. Developers should assess the prevalence of viral mutations using databases like GISAID, focusing on mutations at a significant frequency (greater than 5%). For specific test-related inquiries, FDA recommends consulting with their reviewer.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Do test developers need to evaluate the stealth omicron variant?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. We expect developers to evaluate the impact of all relevant variants. The BA.2 variant-- which some have referred to as the stealth omicron, since it does not have an S-gene dropout-- has accounted for about 23% of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. from March 6 through 12, according to the CDC. We recommend assessing the prevalence of viral mutations in sequence databases, such as the GISAID database, as mutations observed in these databases at a significant frequency may signify that the mutation is present in an increasing proportion of infected individuals in the U.S. And we currently consider a significant frequency to be greater than 5% when considered-- when considering at least 2,000 sequences over a recent period of time, such as the past week, month, or quarter. And additional discussion about that can be seen in the viral mutations guidance. And if you have specific questions about your test or about evaluation of specific variants, we recommend that you discuss that with your reviewer.

#### 10. Requirements for Test Result Reporting in 510k Authorization

QA Block 10-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is there a necessity that results reporting will be required when companies convert to a full 510k authorization?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA encourages reporting mechanisms for home tests due to their public health benefit, but there is no requirement for result reporting in full 510k authorizations, including for molecular 510ks under de novo classifications.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is there a necessity that results reporting will be required when companies convert to a full 510k authorization?
VERBATIM ANSWER: It's not something that I know right now we would advise. I know what we would want is that, because we are asking for connectivity, at least result reporting options for point of care and for at-home tests, that we would hope that those would be carried out into the full authorizations as well, given the public health importance of seeing that. We haven't authorized under full marketing authorization a home test for COVID yet. And lab-based tests-- the lab is recorded-- is required to report. So the reporting for the labs is required under provisions that FDA is not responsible for. And we do encourage for home tests that reporting be built in. It is not required reporting under the same provisions as lab-based reporting, but it is very beneficial for public health, and we would continue to encourage that reporting mechanisms be built in for home tests. If you take a look at the special controls for the molecular 510k from BioFire that was granted last year, there is no mention of reporting in those special controls. So at least for that-- for 510ks under that de novo, there's no requirement placed by FDA, at least.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Could we use a completed clinical study from a home test submission for a point of care EUA submission?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. In short, yes. And in fact, we do recommend that those developers who are willing to take a risk-- we encourage the risk to go right to OTC studies, because if we issue an EUA for an OTC test, it automatically qualifies for a point of care without having to do any point of care studies-- specific studies. All the studies that would-- that are important for point of care, are down there right with-- for the OTC version. It does save effort to do that.

VERBATIM ANSWER: So the main risk, Jim, is that you find out in usability study that you have to modify something. Right? Workload instructions that are significant that would invalidate the clinical study. Thank you for appreciating the potential for bias and doing the clinical study first, and then the usability- - to show the usability of the test seems fine. I know of no issues why you can't take that risk if you're willing to, because it obviously does save time and resources to do that.

#### 13. Guidance on Omicron Sequencing for EUA Resubmissions

QA Block 13-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: If we resubmit using data from a previous submission, can we use 10 positive sequences for sequencing, or do we need to provide more than 10, such as 30 plus additional positives?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: For resubmission using preexisting omicron data, the FDA requires a minimum of 10 samples to assess performance. If starting anew, sequencing the first 30 positives may be necessary. Discuss specific sequencing requirements with your FDA reviewer.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If we resubmit using data from a previous submission, can we use 10 positive sequences for sequencing, or do we need to provide more than 10, such as 30 plus additional positives?
VERBATIM ANSWER: As far as the sequencing that we have requested, this specifically has to do with omicron and performing-- and assessing performance in omicron, since-- because of some of the challenges that we've seen with omicron. So typically, if a submission has already been in-- and this time period is a little bit past now, because omicron is now obviously on the downswing, they may come up a little bit with BA.2. For submissions that were already in, we were-- in order to speed them through the system, we were asking for a minimum of 10 samples that were from the omicron period to be able to assess performance. We weren't necessarily requesting a sequence analysis on those 10 pre-authorization, but the sequences could be potentially provided after if it was important to timely make the decision on the test. And now, if you're doing the study anew, during the omicron period, we would ask that the positives be sequenced. It may be that you can discuss it with the reviewer, whether it's maybe the first 30 positives, and-- if there's challenges with getting sequencing back in a timely manner, and we have a subset, that's something else you can discuss with your reviewer as well.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Is there any indication presently that the public health emergency (PHE), last signed on January 14 and good for 90 days, is going to be extended or renewed?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So this is what I was mentioning a little bit during one of the questions that came in by email. The issuance of EUA and the EUAs being in effect is based on a declaration by the Secretary of HHS that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use of in vitro diagnostics for detection and/or diagnosis of COVID-19. That declaration is different from the public health emergency that you're referring to. So the declaration by the secretary does not expire. It has to be proactively terminated. And as I mentioned before, the declarations-- the similar declarations for previous public health emergencies, such as Zika and Ebola, have not-- have still not been terminated. So we do not have any information on the timeline of when the declaration that circumstances exist may be terminated, or on the 90-day public health emergency and whether or not that will be extended. But we don't have any reason to believe right now that the secretary's declaration would be terminated any time soon.

#### 19. Guidance on Asymptomatic Testing and EUA Applications

QA Block 19-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Should we continue the clinical study to supplement our EUA application for our antigen home test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA advises that this depends. If there is adequate performance in symptomatic cases (80% sensitivity and 70% lower confidence bound), the test may qualify for a serial testing claim with a post-market asymptomatic study commitment. Insufficient asymptomatic data pre-market won't support a single-test screening claim. Submit further details to the FDA inbox as needed.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Should we continue the clinical study to supplement our EUA application for our antigen home test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So it depends. Just to give some high level-- and if you were one to have submitted a question beforehand, we are planning on responding by-- in detail by email. But just as a reminder, we still have the serial testing pathway for asymptomatic. So as long as there's adequate performance on symptomatics-- at least 80% sensitivity to high sensitivity molecular test and a lower 95% confidence lower bound of at least 70%-- you qualify for the serial testing claim for asymptomatics, with a post- market commitment to do an asymptomatic study. If you don't have sufficient numbers of asymptomatics pre-market, and are seeking a single test asymptomatic screening, then that's not going to be sufficient for that claim. So just at a high level, that's what I can respond to today. But again, if you have or-- already asked this question specifically of our inbox, we're planning on responding to that in the next day or two. Or if you haven't and you need the details, then you can submit an email to our templates email.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What does the FDA consider the main challenges from a validation standpoint for a combined usability and clinical agreement study?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The main challenge is discovering during the usability study that modifications are needed, such as workload instruction changes, which could invalidate the clinical study. Conducting the clinical portion first could mitigate bias, and while the approach saves time, it carries some risks.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What does the FDA consider the main challenges from a validation standpoint for a combined usability and clinical agreement study?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So the main risk, Jim, is that you find out in usability study that you have to modify something. Right? Workload instructions that are significant that would invalidate the clinical study. Thank you for appreciating the potential for bias and doing the clinical study first, and then the usability-- to show the usability of the test seems fine. I know of no issues why you can't take that risk if you're willing to, because it obviously does save time and resources to do that. But Kris and/or Toby may have some additional comments to make on this.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does launching a test outside the U.S. lower the risk of challenges during combined usability and clinical agreement studies?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Launching a test outside the U.S. and gaining prior experience with it can lower risks for combined usability and clinical agreement studies. Brand new tests entering the U.S. may benefit from mini studies to verify performance, though this is not required or always recommended.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does launching a test outside the U.S. lower the risk of challenges during combined usability and clinical agreement studies?
VERBATIM ANSWER: First of all, if the test has been launched outside the U.S. and you have a lot of experience already with it, and it works fine, the risks may be lower. But if this is a brand new test-- you're coming first to the U.S., say-- and you don't have as much experience, then you may want to do some mini usability, mini clinical study to make sure that performance with those instructions is decent on a very small subset of users, even company personnel, just to verify that everything's-- that would mitigate some of the risk, obviously, if you did something that.

QA Block 16-5
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What factors should test developers consider when deciding between conducting usability validation before or during a clinical study?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends conducting usability validation before the clinical study to address usability concerns, reduce risks, and avoid stopping or restarting the study. Developers can opt for simultaneous usability and clinical testing to save time and costs, but this approach carries risks.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What factors should test developers consider when deciding between conducting usability validation before or during a clinical study?
VERBATIM ANSWER: To do usability first, and then the clinical study second if everything looks good in the usability. Otherwise, you can make changes to your instructions or device that address any of the potential usability concerns. What the FDA has done for this is to provide flexibility to compress timelines and shorten all of this down, and also potentially limit cost. But it does come with a risk, as I mentioned before. It could be unsafe in some way, and you have to stop the study. Or the usability test done at the same time, or essentially the same time, but after the clinical study testing and the session is done, that then you may spot something that needs to be changed, and you have to restart the clinical study too. We're just providing that flexibility. It's up to the developer to decide which path they want to take, the traditional or the shortened.

QE 16-2: Would incorporating a usability survey with pointed questions during the clinical study help demonstrate that the usability and comprehension of the device reflect the same success as the usability validation?
QE 16-3: Is it acceptable, in FDA's opinion, to show that the usability perception of the user and the performance in the clinical study reflect the same results from the usability study, especially if there are minor changes that don't require supplemental usability studies?
QE 16-4: Can data from usability surveys conducted during clinical studies be used as supplemental data to support a statement of safe and effective use?

##### Implicit Questions Extraction
QI 16-1: What factors should test developers consider when deciding between conducting usability validation before or during a clinical study?
QI 16-2: What are potential risks for usability testing and clinical studies if conducted simultaneously rather than sequentially?
QI 16-3: Does the FDA recommend timeline compression for usability validation and clinical studies if it reduces costs despite associated risks?
QI 16-4: In cases where usability testing identifies issues after clinical studies begin, how should developers address these problems without restarting the entire study?
QI 16-5: What is the FDA's stance on using real-time clinical usability surveys to account for minor post-validation design changes that do not trigger supplemental usability studies?
QI 16-6: For devices with novel features or significant differences from existing products, what additional usability or validation considerations may be required?
