#### 1. FDA Updates on SARS-CoV-2 Testing Approvals and Procedures

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the specific validation steps required for using Q-tip style cotton swabs in COVID-19 testing?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA requires extensive quality control testing for each lot of kits using Q-tip style cotton swabs and advises developers to assess performance impacts such as sensitivity effects near the limit of detection.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the specific validation steps required for using Q-tip style cotton swabs in COVID-19 testing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We also because of the particular swap type they use - it's a Q-tip style cotton swab - that we asked them to do a fairly extensive quality control testing of each lot of kits. So while the cotton Q-tip style swab is now authorized for one entity, we would urge anyone who wants to consider a Q-tip style cotton swab that they carefully look at whether that affects their testing performance at all. Does it impact the sensitivity near LOD? Does it impact the sensitivity? And that is perhaps not an ideal swap type to use but obviously we felt under the conditions of authorization for LabCorp that we're appropriately protecting patients and ensuring accurate testing.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: COVID-19 testing validation, Q-tip style cotton swabs, Testing sensitivity
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does a developer need to validate changes to their swab media if using a new manufacturer's alternative product?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Developers must validate changes to swab media according to their CLIA SOPs but do not need an EUA update. Sharing the data with FDA is voluntary and encouraged.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does a developer need to validate changes to their swab media if using a new manufacturer's alternative product?
VERBATIM ANSWER: In regards to that, I did want to briefly remind everyone of some of the details of our March 16th updated guidance for labs who want to make certain modifications such as a change in swab media, extraction reagents, and PCR instruments. I simply do an unintelligible other bridging study that's appropriate under their own CLIA SOPs and compliant with CLIA. They can implement those changes without a EUA update. And we would love to see that on a voluntary basis so that we can perhaps make it more well-known. If you are adopting any swab, for a new manufacturer say, we would love to see that information but it's not required.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)

TOPICS: voluntary submission, validation of cotton swabs
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-8
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What considerations must be evaluated for saliva as a sample type to gain regulatory approval for COVID-19 testing?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is evaluating saliva as a sample type for COVID-19 testing and notes that a suitable preservative may be needed to maintain RNA integrity and eliminate RNases. However, some preservatives may be toxic, making safety and accuracy critical considerations. Developers should engage with the FDA to assess these factors, as existing data is variable and has not yet supported authorization.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What considerations must be evaluated for saliva as a sample type to gain regulatory approval for COVID-19 testing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We are continuing to take a look at saliva as a sample type. We believe that a preservative may be necessary that preserve the integrity of the RNA. It may destroy RNases. Some of the preservatives that are capable of doing that are potentially toxic, so that is an important consideration in addition to the accuracy. And we would ask that developers who are considering saliva as a sample type, that they come in and to discuss those opportunities with the FDA. And that we together can assess the accuracy and the safety of such a sample type. Some of the data we have seen today has been variable and we have not been able to authorize based on existing data. And we are still trying to assess what the variables are around an adequate saliva sample that ensures accurate and safe testing.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Saliva as sample type, Regulatory considerations, COVID-19 testing
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-9
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the FDA's expectations regarding home collection kits before launching them under EUA?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA requires home collection and testing kits to receive authorization before launching under EUA to ensure patient safety and testing accuracy.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the FDA's expectations regarding home collection kits before launching them under EUA?
VERBATIM ANSWER: I would still remind all that home collection and/or home testing requires an FDA authorization before launching the EUA authorization. And this is to ensure that patients in the home, that safety is considered and that testing is accurate.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Home collection kits, FDA expectations, EUA requirements
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-10
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can two serology tests be combined to improve positive predictive value, and what performance results would be acceptable for this setup?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Combining two serology tests back-to-back can improve positive predictive value significantly. For instance, two highly specific tests (99%) can yield a positive predictive value of 98.9% in a 1% prevalent population. Using a 95% specific test followed by a 99% specific test achieves a value of 94.5%.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can two serology tests be combined to improve positive predictive value, and what performance results would be acceptable for this setup?
VERBATIM ANSWER: One thing that we're examining is if you combine two serology tests back-to-back and you require a positive for both serology tests, how does that impact the positive predictive value. If you take two highly specific tests and that FDA same lower and bound of the confidence interval is 99% and you have the same 1% population, the positive predictive value rises to 98.9% -- a pretty decent number. Even if you start out with the lower serology test that has a specificity of 95% but follow it up with a more specific test such as 99% specific in a 1% prevalent population, your positive predictive value rises to 94.5%. So just under 95% -- also a fairly decent number. So I thought it was important to go over their performance characteristics of tests and how they're applied to populations and what a positive result can really mean and perhaps the importance of doing a confirmation serology test if the information from a serology test is important to you.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Serology testing, Positive predictive value, Combining diagnostics
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-12
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How does the FDA prioritize complaints about tests and address incidents leading to concerns about product performance or fraud?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA addresses complaints about inappropriate marketing or fraud via a dedicated fraud email and through their active MedWatch system, where reported issues are reviewed, and appropriate decisions are made.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How does the FDA prioritize complaints about tests and address incidents leading to concerns about product performance or fraud?
VERBATIM ANSWER: I want to just move on quickly to one other thing and that is they continue to hear complaints about inappropriate marketing or perhaps fraud. We do have a fraud email. We appreciate all submissions to that email. And also I would also remind you that we have an active MedWatch going. You can go to the MedWatch FDA site and report any problems you see. We do review those complaints and those data and make appropriate decisions based on it.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Complaints about tests, Fraud in marketing, FDA MedWatch system
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-13
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What's the role of 95% confidence interval lower bounds in the performance evaluation of serology tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA requires 95% confidence interval calculations to evaluate sensitivity and specificity. The lower bound is closely examined because small sample sizes can result in wider intervals, potentially lowering the lower bound. Larger studies help narrow these intervals, providing more reliable data. The lower bound is critical for assessing the full range of possible results.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What's the role of 95% confidence interval lower bounds in the performance evaluation of serology tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: When we measure sensitivity and specificity, we do require calculations of the 95% confidence interval. And we do look closely at the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval because for any given sample size involved in testing, the smaller the sample size the greater potentially the spread of the 95% confidence interval. So for example, you may actually measure a fairly high specificity but if the sample size is low, the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval can be quite low. That is why we always favor larger studies over smaller studies. Some of the high volume, high-throughput serology central lab tests that we've seen the data on -- one of which we've already authorized -- tests more than a thousand patients for specificity determination. Obviously when you test that many patients, your 95% confidence interval is going to be even more narrow. FDA However, even though it's narrower, the lower end of the 95th percentile confidence interval is important for looking at the full range of possible results.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: serology test evaluation, 95% confidence interval, test performance
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-14
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How is the public-private partnership led by the FDA improving terminology consistency for diagnostic test reporting (such as SARS-CoV-2)?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA's public-private partnership is addressing inconsistent reporting by standardizing how diagnostic tests, including SARS-CoV-2 and serological tests, are described from laboratories. Terminology codes are being developed for uniform test descriptions, enabling better aggregation, analysis, and validation of data in real-time.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How is the public-private partnership led by the FDA improving terminology consistency for diagnostic test reporting (such as SARS-CoV-2)?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Great. Thank you, Tim. I'll give a brief update on the topic of laboratory data harmonization. In this context, it's sometimes an overlooked but really essential aspect of understanding how many infections we have in the country at any given time. The detection of the emergence, prevalence, and spread of FDA infectious diseases is essential to inform efforts to protect and preserve public health from the local, state, and national levels. So currently surveillance efforts are hindered due to inabilities to pool and compare data derived from laboratory diagnostics unless consistent reporting practices have been adopted electronically. At the core of this problem is a fundamental inconsistency and how tests are described where we're seeing with SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics, for example, the same test or a test meant to give the same type of answer is often described in different ways, which leads to ambiguities in the meaning of that information as well as an inability to roll it up or aggregate that data and understand it and analyze it collectively. So as part of a public-private partnership, the FDA and APHL manufacturers, labs standards developers, CDC, and other agencies across HHS are working to ensure that molecular diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 as well as serological testing can be described the same way from the get-go right out of the lab. The terminology codes are currently being developed and assigned to each test to represent the question that the test asks of each specimen and the range of answers that can be generated from that test. This information will be extremely important in terms of addressing shortages for testing, ensuring that tests are working the way that they're intended to, and better understanding their performance in the field moving forward and expediting ways to validate and interpret how therapeutic or clinical interventions are actually working in terms of health outcomes as we move forward. So simply by describing our diagnostic tests the same way from the get-go, the data generated from those tests can be used to gather more detailed information in real-time that will help us protect the nation and get back on FDA our feet. We have email address that inquiries can be sent to. The email address that you can reach out to us at is SHIELD-LabCodes@fda.hhs.gov. That will be able to receive emails tomorrow, so hold off on emailing us until tomorrow if you're interested in this information and would like to participate in this effort. Thank you.

QA Block 1-15
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What standardization steps are required to describe SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic and serology tests for interoperability across laboratories?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA, in partnership with various organizations, is addressing inconsistent reporting of SARS-CoV-2 test data by developing standardized terminology codes. These codes ensure all diagnostic and serological tests are described uniformly, enabling better data aggregation, analysis, and interoperability.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What standardization steps are required to describe SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic and serology tests for interoperability across laboratories?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Currently surveillance efforts are hindered due to inabilities to pool and compare data derived from laboratory diagnostics unless consistent reporting practices have been adopted electronically. At the core of this problem is a fundamental inconsistency and how tests are described where we're seeing with SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics, for example, the same test or a test meant to give the same type of answer is often described in different ways, which leads to ambiguities in the meaning of that information as well as an inability to roll it up or aggregate that data and understand it and analyze it collectively.

REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-16
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the expected performance levels of specificity and sensitivity in serology tests for lower prevalence populations, according to the FDA?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: For serology tests, specificity and sensitivity are critical, especially in low-prevalence populations. A test with 99% specificity in a 1% prevalence population has a positive predictive value (PPV) of 49%. For tests with 95% specificity, PPV drops to 15.4%. By combining a 95% specific test with a more specific 99% test, the PPV can improve to 94.5%, demonstrating the value of confirmatory testing.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the expected performance levels of specificity and sensitivity in serology tests for lower prevalence populations, according to the FDA?
VERBATIM ANSWER: When we talk about performance, we talk about what is the sensitivity of the assay, what is the specificity of the assay. And at times, depending on what the comparative is, we call sensitivity percent positive agreement and sometimes they call a specificity negative percent agreement. Those are just an initial look at what performance is. It's also important -- and I believe especially for serology tests -- to understand what the prevalence of disease is as far as the impact on the actual clinical testing performance and what the clinical testing results mean. We look at things such as positive predictive value and negative predictive value to tell us in certain populations what is the impact of testing and in fact what is the impact of actual sensitivity and specificity. When we measure sensitivity and specificity, we do require calculations of the 95% confidence interval. And we do look closely at the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval because for any given sample size involved in testing, the smaller the sample size the greater potentially the spread of the 95% confidence interval. So for example, you may actually measure a fairly high specificity but if the sample size is low, the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval can be quite low. That is why we always favor larger studies over smaller studies. Some of the high volume, high-throughput serology central lab tests that we've seen the data on -- one of which we've already authorized -- tests more than a thousand patients for specificity determination. Obviously when you test that many patients, your 95% confidence interval is going to be even more narrow. However, even though it's narrower, the lower end of the 95th percentile confidence interval is important for looking at the full range of possible results. And I would say that you know, some of the specificities are quite high, you know, in the mid-99 percentile-- so 99.5, 99.6 -- in the lower bound is around 99%. If you look at positive predictive value in a population that has a prevalence of 1% we don't yet know what the actual prevalence of COVID-19 is across all of our communities in the United States and as an overall measure. Those efforts are underway and those efforts are very important for us to understand how to apply a given test sensitivity and specificity to your specific situation. But I just wanted to give a couple of performance numbers so that you understand the impact of prevalence and specificity on actual positive predictive values. Positive predictive value is a measure of how many times out of a hundred is a positive result, a true positive. So if you take a test that is 99% specific -- and I'm using the lower end of the 95% confidence interval here -- and you measure it in a population that has a 1% prevalence of disease, your positive predictive value is 49%. That means only 49 times out of 100 is that positive result a true positive. The rest of the time it is a false-positive result. You might falsely assume a patient developed an immune response to SARS-CoV-2. If you reduce the specificity of 95% -- that same prevalence of 1% -- the positive predictive value falls to 15.4%. Only 15 times out of 100 is that positive result a true positive. One thing that we're examining is if you combine two serology tests back-to- back and you require a positive for both serology tests, how does that impact the positive predictive value. If you take two highly specific tests and that same lower and bound of the confidence interval is 99% and you have the same 1% population, the positive predictive value rises to 98.9% -- a pretty decent number. Even if you start out with the lower serology test that has a specificity of 95% but follow it up with a more specific test such as 99% specific in a 1% prevalent population, your positive predictive value rises to 94.5%. So just under 95% -- also a fairly decent number.

#### 3. Capillary Blood Versus Venipuncture in Serology Testing Debate

QA Block 3-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are you still taking the position that there is no scientific evidence that capillary blood is equal to venipuncture blood for rapid serology test kits?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA encourages developers to submit data for evaluating equivalency of fingerstick and venipuncture for serology tests. Templates will provide guidance on the minimum data needed, and one test has been authorized with post-market studies to assess performance.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are you still taking the position that there is no scientific evidence that capillary blood is equal to venipuncture blood for rapid serology test kits?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, that's a great question. So we welcome all developers to come forward and show us their data for point-of-care testing. Fingerstick may not be required for point-of-care testing if there is the ability to do a venipuncture. We're open to fingerstick as a sample type. And our serology templates, once they're published, will describe publicly what we think the minimum number of patients are to demonstrate the equivalency, the matrix equivalency between venipuncture and fingerstick or serum and plasma and fingerstick. So that hopefully will be posted very soon for all to see. So we are a data-driven organization that requires submission of data for us to review. We have given the opportunity for one authorized test to do fingerstick. They have actually agreed to do follow-on post-market study for the minimum number of fingersticks required for us to assess the performance there. We also have invited them and others to do the usability study from the point- of-care to show that lay users, non-laboratorians, can perform accurate testing. So we do welcome submissions for those uses and are fully willing to authorize them.

#### 4. FDA's Focus on Point-of-Care Test Authorization

QA Block 4-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Where will there be prioritization of serology tests that can perform high-specificity and high-sensitivity point-of-care testing in the coming weeks and this year?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is prioritizing authorization of point-of-care serology tests, including ensuring they can provide accurate results in settings without trained laboratory professionals. They require data proving test performance (e.g., sensitivity, specificity) and equivalency between sample types. FDA stresses the need for confirmatory testing to address any uncertainties in clinical decisions.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Where will there be prioritization of serology tests that can perform high-specificity and high-sensitivity point-of-care testing in the coming weeks and this year?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So we are very interested in authorizing point-of-care tests -- both molecular and serology. As I said in response to the last question, we want to see the data that accurate testing can be performed in the point of care testing site in a wave setting with users that are not trained laboratory professionals. And if fingerstick is an important element of that point of care setting, to be able to see data show the equivalency for that particular test between point of care - I mean fingerstick and another sample type that's also been evaluated. So we think this is possible. Our template will describe some minimum performance characteristics that we need to be able to see such as sensitivity and specificity. And an example is if specificity is not high enough, we would want to understand why that is. And perhaps more cross-reactivity testing with known potential cross-reacting respiratory pathogens may be required to understand the performance of that test. As I said in my introductory remarks though, even if you have a very highly specific test - one of these very high-quality, high-throughput central lab tests which have studied over 1000 patients - the lower end of the confidence interval at 99% in certain populations may not be alone high enough to make important clinical decisions for that patient. And confirmatory serology testing may the important element serology testing -- making a decision based on even a high-performing test may not be sufficient to ensure that you know what really happened with that patient. Hopefully, that addresses your FDA question. I would also add that performance at the point of care potentially could be a little bit lower as long as it's reflexed for confirmation to a higher-performing central lab test.

VERBATIM QUESTION: How can labs verify the Abbott ID Now test if they can only use a direct swab method, given that instructions for this are not in the package insert?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. So you could contrive samples in the lab to verify testing. So take a known positive patient sample from VTM, understand, you know, where the range of positivity is if you have a molecular test that gives you cycle thresholds. Find something near, you know, a low positive or dilute it down to a low positive. You can then pipe that on to swabs in replicates and test that in the Abbott ID Now.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are you going to conduct plaque studies during serology studies to evaluate whether true neutralizing antibodies are detected?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is in early discussions with developers regarding neutralizing antibody tests, which are challenging to perform. Such tests could help determine adaptive immune responses but don't always link antibodies to immunity or infection-fighting ability.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are you going to conduct plaque studies during serology studies to evaluate whether true neutralizing antibodies are detected?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. I mean if you're really wanting to understand is the adaptive immune response producing antibodies that can fight the infection, you would want to know whether or not neutralizing antibodies are present. And for those clinicians who are looking at potentially using convalescent plasma to treat patients, you would also want to know are neutralizing antibodies present. So we are in early dialogue with some developers of neutralizing antibody test. That is not something that's usually performed. And it would be, you know, and sort of uneasy to perform tests. So we hope to see more developers of assays that can measure neutralizing antibodies. And that would be very informative. We do have the ability in some cases with some developers to try to correlate detection of antibodies and also in the same samples realize whether or not those samples have neutralizing antibodies. But unfortunately, it's not always clear that all the antibodies in the adaptive immune response are going to be neutralizing. So it's a bit of a challenge for the tests that aren't designed to measure specifically neutralizing antibodies to be able to make any sort of determination. So we believe it's important that it's clear that although some of these serology tests can accurately measure the presence of antibodies that arise to the infection, that it doesn't equate with immunity or the ability to fight off an infection.

#### 8. Guidelines for Antibody Test Validation and Approvals

QA Block 8-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is it acceptable to use only five out of the recommended seven samples for cross-reactivity testing for an IgM and IgG antibody test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA suggests alternate methods for cross-reactivity assessment if you can't obtain all recommended samples. Using a variety of negative samples, including recent pre-COVID-19 exposures, is an acceptable surrogate approach. More final guidance will be available in the FDA template.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is it acceptable to use only five out of the recommended seven samples for cross-reactivity testing for an IgM and IgG antibody test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So our template -- which hopefully will come out very soon -- explain the number of these situations. In the interim, you can engage with our expert FDA staff through the template email. But in general, there are alternate ways to achieve adequate assessment of cross-reactivity. For example, obviously the more known samples with known convalescent plasma or serum that you have that's specific to certain respiratory viruses is helpful in our assessment. However, you can test a minimum number of negatives -- a variety of negatives -- some of which, many of which can be pre-COVID-19 but not too old. We want to see folks that have been exposed recently to a variety of respiratory pathogens. And so by simply assessing you know, enough negative patients you can get a surrogate assessment of potential cross-reactivity -- especially as it relates to the general population. So that is an alternate way to do that. And the template will layout minimum numbers which I don't want to speak FDA to right now because they haven't been totally cleared for representing that publicly. But we will post it on our website as soon as it is cleared. And in the interim, you can get those numbers from our staff. So there are two alternate ways of going at that.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Can you explain more on how we can demonstrate that our test can detect IgG and IgM both?
VERBATIM ANSWER: And as far as class specificity goes, our template will also outline multiple methods to achieve it. One is you may have well-characterized anti-IgG, anti-IgM antibodies for the detection. And so if those antibodies are well characterized for other potential uses that you have used them for, those previous studies can be used does evidence.

#### 9. CLIA Complexity Determination Process Under Emergency Use Authorization

QA Block 9-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: If you have an EUA, would you be cleared for non-CLIA laboratories to use?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Tests authorized under EUA are generally categorized as high complexity, but in emergencies, the FDA can deem them as moderately complex or waived. Such designations are communicated in authorization letters and on the FDA website.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If you have an EUA, would you be cleared for non-CLIA laboratories to use?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. So first of all, those developers that notify us through pathway C or D are automatically put into a high complexity category. And that should be those that we have listed already, those should be designated on our FAQ page now in such a manner as H for high complexity. As soon as we're able to authorize them and if we authorize them for moderate complexity situations and/or waved situations, the website authorization will be updated with that information and the website will be updated as well. So we take a traditional approach on assessing whether a technology is acceptable for other than a high-complexity environment -- whether it can be moderately complex or a wave setting. We do not do a formal complexity determination as we could do outside of an emergency situation. Our office at the FDA is legally responsible for making those assessments for CLIA categorization. That task has been assigned to our office and we have staff who are experienced in that. FDA In the emergency use situation, we are allowed under law to deem a test as moderately complex and/or waved. It is not a formal classification. We make that deemed status clear in our authorization letter and in a language that's allowed in the developer's instructions for use.

QA Block 10-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the FDA require a EUA submission if a high-complexity lab using a FDA-approved EUA molecular test for respiratory specimens wants to validate and use saliva as a sample type?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA requests developers validating saliva as a sample type to discuss their design and data sufficiency with the FDA. Saliva presents challenges, and data from its use has often been inadequate. This process ensures validation safety until its performance can be better defined.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Okay. So if you're a high-complexity lab using an FDA approved EUA molecular test that's authorized for respiratory specimens, does FDA require a EUA submission if that lab wants to validate and use saliva as a sample type?

VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. So that frequently involves a collection device that is not formally covered under you know, the COVID-19 diagnostic situation. We have also seen data from saliva that is not really good enough for clinical use. So we are currently asking developers who want to utilize saliva -- and we do encourage it because we obviously already authorized one such test -- to come in and discuss their design with us and make sure that whatever data is generated it's FDA going to be sufficient for us to say yes, that looks good. And, you know, until such a time that we can define the true performance of saliva and we can predict the performance, we think this is the safest way to go right now. And there is - some of the data is just not good enough to support it and we don't know all the variables such as how do you need to preserve it, how do you store it, how do you transport it, and how do you extract it.

VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the FDA's expectations for saliva sample extraction methods?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So we are currently asking developers who want to utilize saliva -- and we do encourage it because we obviously already authorized one such test -- to come in and discuss their design with us and make sure that whatever data is generated it's FDA going to be sufficient for us to say yes, that looks good. And, you know, until such a time that we can define the true performance of saliva and we can predict the performance, we think this is the safest way to go right now. And there is - some of the data is just not good enough to support it and we don't know all the variables such as how do you need to preserve it, how do you store it, how do you transport it, and how do you extract it. And then what particular tests perform well on saliva-based samples.

#### 11. Assessing Serological Test Performance and Population Prevalence Accuracy

QA Block 11-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How do we gauge the true positive rate of a test in the population?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA suggests using serological tests with different antigens, particularly high-performing IgG tests, to gauge the true positive rate of a test. This approach provides a more accurate estimate of prevalence in the population. Leveraging statistics, applying a 95% confidence interval, and using the lower bound of sensitivity and specificity calculations ensures conservative accuracy.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How do we gauge the true positive rate of a test in the population?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Extensive molecular tests could help but that only tells you a snapshot of time for when patients are shedding detectable virus and the assay performs well enough. Serological means are probably the better means of assessing what the true prevalence is in a given population. Some of the studies I've seen may be limited to the performance of just one FDA maybe point-of-care test for which the true performance characteristics, the true specificity may not be entirely known. And so when you do an assessment you may say we just did a hundred samples. They were all negative. Therefore, our specificity is 100%. But that may or may not be the case. Using statistics, the application of a 95% confidence interval to the data set is important. And so the more data that you have, the more assurance you know what the performance is. I would postulate though that the best way to assess prevalence through serological testing means is to take two very high-performing but different tests that utilize different antigens -- not the same antigen -- to detect these antibodies. You may limit yourself to IgG, which is probably the most important antibody. IgM presents some difficulties maybe even in specificity sometimes. So if you look at two high-performing IgG tests -- and it might be just the IgG component of a combined test -- and if they are both positive, your certainty around whether the assessment of prevalence in the population is going to be much greater. If you choose tests that have relatively high sensitivity, you're not going to lose a lot of sensitivity in requiring the due positive. For example, even if the sensitivity for the two tests is only 90% your overall sensitivity for requiring the combined positive results only falls to about 81%. So obviously the higher the sensitivity for each of those two serological tests, the lower your sensitivity falls. But knowing the true performance on a lot of samples for these serological tests will give you a better estimate of what the range of performance characteristics are and you can take that into account. But again FDA thinks to be conservative you ought to take the lower bound of the 95% confidence level and not go any higher than that for both sensitivity and specificity calculations.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What level of sensitivity and specificity does the FDA recommend for serology tests aiming for lay user use in point of care settings?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA has not yet authorized any serology tests for point-of-care settings due to insufficient data showing their accuracy in lay-user hands.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What level of sensitivity and specificity does the FDA recommend for serology tests aiming for lay user use in point of care settings?
VERBATIM ANSWER: To date we have authorized four serology tests. None of them yet are point of care even though some of them are designed to be performed in the near-patient point of care setting. And this is because data has not yet been submitted for anything that we could authorize yet that shows accurate testing in the lay user hands. That is usually the point of care patient setting. These lay user studies are important as outside of trained laboratory professionals performing testing, we want to ensure that accurate test results are obtained.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are manufacturers required to combine serology tests to achieve higher positive predictive values in low prevalence scenarios?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is examining the impact of combining two serology tests to improve positive predictive values in low prevalence populations. This approach is not mandatory but demonstrates that using two highly specific tests sequentially can significantly enhance positive predictive values.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are manufacturers required to combine serology tests to achieve higher positive predictive values in low prevalence scenarios?
VERBATIM ANSWER: One thing that we're examining is if you combine two serology tests back-to-back and you require a positive for both serology tests, how does that impact the positive predictive value. If you take two highly specific tests and that FDA same lower and bound of the confidence interval is 99% and you have the same 1% population, the positive predictive value rises to 98.9% -- a pretty decent number. Even if you start out with the lower serology test that has a specificity of 95% but follow it up with a more specific test such as 99% specific in a 1% prevalent population, your positive predictive value rises to 94.5%.

VERBATIM QUESTION: What steps can labs take to verify the Abbott ID Now test in the absence of patient samples?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. So you could contrive samples in the lab to verify testing. So take a known positive patient sample from VTM...understand, you know, where the range of positivity is if you have a molecular test that gives you cycle thresholds. Find something near, you know, a low positive or dilute it down to a low positive. You can then pipe that on to swabs in replicates and test that in the Abbott ID Now.
