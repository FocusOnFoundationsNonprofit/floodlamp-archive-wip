QA Block 1-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the key differences between the 319 public health emergency declaration and the 564 declaration in terms of FDA's capabilities?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The 319 public health emergency declaration, under the Public Health Service Act, lasts 90 days and does not enable FDA to issue EUAs. In contrast, the 564 declaration, under the FD&C Act, allows FDA to issue EUAs, is not time limited, and continues until terminated by the HHS Secretary.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the key differences between the 319 public health emergency declaration and the 564 declaration in terms of FDA's capabilities?
VERBATIM ANSWER: There are different public health emergency determinations. There's the 319 public health declaration, public health emergency declaration rather, which is under the Public Health Service Act, and that is a 90-day declaration that has been renewed many times since 2020, and it is set to expire on May 11. The 319 does not enable FDA to issue EUAs. The determination and declaration that do enable FDA to issue EUAs is under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act or, the FD&C Act, and that's the determination under Section 564 of the FD&C Act. So you'll hear us talk about the 564 declaration a lot. That is not time limited and it continues until the HHS secretary terminates it.

QA Block 1-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What aspects of enforcement policies are most relevant to IVD manufacturing during the transition?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The guidance emphasizes preparation for the transition period by complying with adverse event reporting, corrections and removals reporting, and registration/listing requirements. Manufacturers intending to continue distribution must prepare marketing submissions to continue beyond transition phases.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What aspects of enforcement policies are most relevant to IVD manufacturing during the transition?
VERBATIM ANSWER: This guidance has an implementation date of May 11 of this year, and that's because that is when the 319 public health emergency declaration will expire, and this transition for these enforcement policies is tied to that public health emergency, the 319. We're not going to go into many details for this guidance because there aren't many IVD-specific considerations, but here's a quick overview. Basically the guidance goes into enforcement policies that are for manufacturers that intend to continue distribution of their devices after the transition period, as well as manufacturers who do not intend to continue distribution, but may have some distributed devices still in use. So we recommend that manufacturers begin preparation now before the implementation date to begin preparing any required marketing submission if you intend to continue distribution of your device beyond Phase 2. Starting on May 11th, which is coming up real soon, you should start following adverse event reporting requirements if you're not already. And then by August 9th, which is 90 days in, you should begin to follow the requirements under the regulation 21 CFR Part 806 for reports of corrections and removals, and you should have registered and listed by that date if you intend to continue distribution. And then you should make sure to submit your marketing submission early enough to have it accepted before the start of Phase 3 if you intend to continue distribution. Then November 7th is 180 days after the implementation date, and that is when the guidances in List 1 will no longer be in effect. So the enforcement policies in the enforcement policy transition guidance, will be in place to address any remaining devices that may still be in distribution at that point.

QA Block 1-7
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How should manufacturers prepare their post-EUA regulatory strategy in advance?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Manufacturers should plan their post-EUA regulatory strategy early by complying with current EUA terms, preparing required marketing submissions, engaging with the FDA via pre-submissions, and implementing quality system requirements. Exemptions or variances for compliance must be requested within the first 90 days of the transition period.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How should manufacturers prepare their post-EUA regulatory strategy in advance?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So we recommend that as soon as possible prior to the advance notice of termination that you begin to plan for your post-EUA regulatory strategy. You should already be complying with the terms of your devices' EUAs and you should begin preparing any required marketing submissions if you do intend to continue distribution. We've talked a lot on here about using pre-submissions. We do encourage you to begin those discussions with the agency as early as possible. There are quality system requirements that will kick in after the transition period, and so we do recommend that you start thinking about putting those QS systems in place if you don't already have them. If you intend to continue distribution and you have concerns about that or you have unique compliance considerations, there is a step in the transition where you may request an exemption or a variance from a device QS requirement. If you do intend to do that, you should get that in before the 90-day period, so that first 90 days of the transition period, whenever that starts.

QA Block 1-8
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What steps can manufacturers take to use real-world data to support regulatory submissions?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA encourages manufacturers to use real-world data for regulatory decision-making through the NEST Implementation Cases project, which analyzes data from COVID diagnostic tests. Manufacturers can engage with NEST or reach out to the FDA via the COVID mailbox or through a pre-submission.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What steps can manufacturers take to use real-world data to support regulatory submissions?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We have talked also on the previous town halls about leveraging real-world data. We are committed to the use of real-world evidence for regulatory decision making as much as possible. There is a national evaluation system for health technologies, or NEST Implementation Cases project that is starting up for analyzing data from COVID diagnostic tests, including lateral flow assays and lab tests. And interested manufacturers can reach out to get more information about that and to engage with NEST on how to leverage that data. If you are interested in using real-world data and real-world evidence to help in the transition, you can reach out to us through the COVID mailbox, COVID19dx@fda.hhs.gov , or submit a pre-submission.

QA Block 1-9
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the FDA's recommendations for submitting a CLIA waiver request tied to a marketing submission under the EUA transition?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends submitting marketing submissions needing CLIA categorization as early as possible to provide time for review and avoid disruptions after EUA termination.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the FDA's recommendations for submitting a CLIA waiver request tied to a marketing submission under the EUA transition?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We recommend that any marketing submission that may need a CLIA categorization decision, such as tests intended for use in moderate complexity labs or in CLIA certificate of waiver settings, be submitted as soon as possible so that we have as much time as possible to review the marketing submission and the CLIA categorization request for a CLIA waiver by application prior to the termination of the EUA declaration. We want to reduce the potential for any disruption in distribution and use.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: CLIA waiver request, EUA transition, Marketing submission timing
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-10
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the FDA's policy on the distribution and use of IVDs where the manufacturer does not plan to continue post-EUA?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA does not intend to request market removal of single-use, non life-sustaining IVD devices distributed prior to the EUA termination date, provided they are used before their expiration dates. Manufacturers must comply with applicable requirements like adverse event reporting during the applicable periods.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the FDA's policy on the distribution and use of IVDs where the manufacturer does not plan to continue post-EUA?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We don't intend to request a market removal where those are single-use, non life supporting/non life sustaining devices, which includes IVDs or the COVID tests that we've been focused on here, that were distributed before the EUA termination date and are used before the product expiration date. You should also make sure that you're aware of any applicable requirements that would go along with the use of those devices, such as the adverse event reporting under 21 CFR Part 803, and you will be expected to comply with those requirements for the duration that they're applicable, which may extend beyond the EUA termination date and when you stop distributing.

REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-11
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the expected approach to enforcement discretion for laboratory-developed tests (LDTs) following the termination of the 564 EUA declaration?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA intends to apply the same enforcement discretion approach to COVID-19 laboratory-developed tests (LDTs) as it does to other LDTs following termination of the 564 EUA declaration.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the expected approach to enforcement discretion for laboratory-developed tests (LDTs) following the termination of the 564 EUA declaration?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Generally for LDTs we have exercised enforcement discretion, so we have not generally exercised our authority to enforce regulatory requirements for LDTs, although we do maintain that authority. We have not applied this general enforcement discretion approach to certain LDTs, including those used for declared emergencies under a 564 declaration. So following termination of the 564 EUA declaration for COVID IVDs, we intend to have the same enforcement approach for COVID-19 LDTs as we do for other LDTs.

#### 2. COVID-19 Test Regulations Post-Public Health Emergency

QA Block 2-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the FDA's plan regarding devices currently under EUA submission review post May 11th?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The expiration of the 319 declaration won't affect the 564 EUA declarations, which remain active until terminated by HHS with 180 days' notice. FDA will continue reviewing EUA requests until the 564 declaration ends, but will stop once it's terminated.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the FDA's plan regarding devices currently under EUA submission review post May 11th?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The 319 and 564 declarations are independent. The 319 public health emergency expiration does not impact the 564 declarations. The EUA declarations related to COVID-19 under Section 564 of the FD&C Act will continue until the Secretary of HHS ends them. Additionally, as we've discussed and is in the transition plan guidance, we expect 180 day notice before the 564 EUA declarations are terminated. So while the 564 declaration for COVID-19 IVDs is in place, manufacturers may submit EUA requests, including supplemental EUA requests, and FDA will continue to consider them based on our previously communicated prioritization and considering the public health needs. Once the 564 declaration is terminated, we will no longer be authorized to issue EUAs, and therefore we will not continue review of any EUA requests that are under review at that time.

QA Block 2-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: During the transition period for the EUA transition guidances, will supplements or amendments be allowed for modifications to emergency use authorization devices?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: During the transition period, manufacturers may submit supplemental EUA requests for modifications to EUA devices, which FDA will review based on public health priorities. However, after the 564 declaration is terminated, FDA will no longer review EUA requests.
VERBATIM QUESTION: During the transition period for the EUA transition guidances, will supplements or amendments be allowed for modifications to emergency use authorization devices?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So while the 564 declaration for COVID-19 IVDs is in place, manufacturers may submit EUA requests, including supplemental EUA requests, and FDA will continue to consider them based on our previously communicated prioritization and considering the public health needs. Once the 564 declaration is terminated, we will no longer be authorized to issue EUAs, and therefore we will not continue review of any EUA requests that are under review at that time.

QA Block 2-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How do the COVID-19 transition guidances impact manufacturers with ongoing clinical studies for future EUA submissions?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends that manufacturers with ongoing clinical studies for future EUA requests consider how these efforts may align with traditional marketing submissions, as traditional marketing submissions are now encouraged.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How do the COVID-19 transition guidances impact manufacturers with ongoing clinical studies for future EUA submissions?
VERBATIM ANSWER: If you have an ongoing clinical study or you're otherwise planning for a future EUA request for a COVID-19 test, we recommend that you consider how your clinical study and other validation efforts may also support a traditional marketing submission, since we are encouraging all manufacturers to pursue traditional marketing submissions.

TOPICS: COVID-19 transition guidances, EUA submissions, clinical studies
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 2-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: In light of FDA's COVID transition guidances, does the FDA prioritize pre-market submissions?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA does not prioritize traditional marketing submissions like 510ks and de novos in the same way as EUA requests. They aim to review them within MDUFA timelines: 15 days for acceptance decisions, 60 for substantive reviews, and 90 for final decisions, excluding hold times.
VERBATIM QUESTION: In light of FDA's COVID transition guidances, does the FDA prioritize pre-market submissions?
VERBATIM ANSWER: That said, marketing submissions, including 510ks and de novos, are not prioritized in the same way that EUA requests have been. We do aim to review marketing submissions according to the timelines established under the Medical Device User Fee Amendment or MDUFA program. Generally 510k applicants can expect submission acceptance review decisions within 15 calendar days, substantive review decisions within 60 days, and final decisions within 90 days. And those days are calculated as what we refer to as FDA days, so days under FDA review, not including any days where the submission might be placed on hold due to a request for additional information from the applicant.

TOPICS: COVID-19 EUA transition, Pre-market submissions prioritization
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 2-5
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How does the public health emergency termination on May 11th impact laboratory developed tests (LDTs)?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The public health emergency termination on May 11 does not impact LDT requirements as the EUA declaration for COVID-19 under Section 564 remains in effect. FDA exercises enforcement discretion for most LDTs but enforces requirements for those used in declared emergencies. Once the EUA declaration ends, the FDA will treat COVID-19 LDTs as it does other LDTs.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How does the public health emergency termination on May 11th impact laboratory developed tests (LDTs)?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Thanks, Joe. I'm not sure why we had point of care in that question. I'll just clarify that most LDTs are not point of care. But for LDTs in general, FDA has generally exercised enforcement discretion, as we've talked about, meaning that we don't exercise our authority to enforce regulatory requirements for LDTs, although we do have that authority. We don't apply the general enforcement discretion approach to certain LDTs, as I mentioned in the slides, including those used for declared emergencies under 564. As we've mentioned, the 319 and 564 are independent. The EUA declaration under 564 is continuing, and we expect that 180-day notice before it is terminated. Therefore, even after the PHE, the Public Health Emergency, termination on May 11th, the EUA declaration for COVID-19 IVDs is still in effect, including the EUA requirements for COVID-19 tests, and that does apply for LDTs. This will continue to help assure that COVID-19 tests remain appropriately accurate and reliable, including in the setting of new variants and sub-variants that we continue to see with COVID-19. Following termination of the EUA declaration, that's the 564 declaration, which we don't have a date yet for that termination, so that 564 declaration for COVID-19 IVDs, once that is terminated, we do intend to have the same enforcement approach for COVID-19 LDTs as we do for other LDTs.

QA Block 2-6
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can a laboratory developed test (LDT) point of care COVID-19 test be offered after May 11th in alignment with the general enforcement discretion policy for LDTs outside of an EUA declaration?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA confirms that enforcement discretion for LDTs generally continues, but certain LDTs, including those for declared emergencies under 564, remain subject to EUA requirements. The EUA declaration for COVID-19 IVDs will persist post-May 11th until terminated, with a 180-day notice expected before termination. Afterwards, COVID-19 LDTs will follow the same enforcement approach as other LDTs.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can a laboratory developed test (LDT) point of care COVID-19 test be offered after May 11th in alignment with the general enforcement discretion policy for LDTs outside of an EUA declaration?

QA Block 2-7
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can a low positive analysis, stratifying the positive percent agreement (PPA) by percentages of low positive samples, be used to support a traditional marketing submission such as a 510k?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA does not currently intend to use low positive analysis to support traditional marketing authorizations like 510ks for COVID-19 antigen tests. Robust performance in a prospective clinical study is expected, meeting specific performance criteria. Low positive analysis was unique to the pandemic due to high case prevalence and widespread testing, conditions that no longer apply.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can a low positive analysis, stratifying the positive percent agreement (PPA) by percentages of low positive samples, be used to support a traditional marketing submission such as a 510k?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So our recommendations to support a traditional marketing submission are different from our recommendations to support an EUA. And at this time, we don't intend to use this type of low positive analysis to support traditional marketing authorizations. Generally, we would expect robust overall performance observed in a prospective clinical study for COVID-19 antigen tests seeking traditional marketing authorization, with a minimum PPA of 80% and a lower bounds of the 95%, confidence interval of 70%. The special controls that such tests must meet are outlined in the FDA's recently granted de novo, and that's de novo number DEN220039. And this de novo was from the Quidel Corporation for the Sofia 2 SARS Antigen plus FIA. The low positive analysis used during the EUA authorization for some tests was based on a variety of factors that were kind of unique to the pandemic. This included high prevalence of reported COVID-19 cases, the viral load of the circulating variants at that time, and the frequent use of serial testing or otherwise repeated regular testing, such as workplace or school testing programs. This all led to a determination that the benefits of wide availability of OTC COVID-19 tests outweighed the potential risks of lower sensitivity. As these factors have now largely shifted with lower prevalence of reported COVID-19 cases, as well as reduced testing, FDA's recommendations for traditional marketing authorization do not include the use of a low positive analysis.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the implications of the 564 EUA declarations continuing beyond the expiration of the 319 public health emergency?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The expiration of the 319 public health emergency does not affect the 564 EUA declarations, which remain in effect until terminated by HHS with a 180-day notice. While the 564 EUA is active, manufacturers can submit EUA requests, but once terminated, the FDA cannot issue or review EUAs.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the implications of the 564 EUA declarations continuing beyond the expiration of the 319 public health emergency?

QA Block 2-10
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Should manufacturers prioritize preparing for traditional marketing submissions even if their EUA is still valid?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA encourages manufacturers to prioritize preparing for traditional marketing submissions, such as 510ks or de novos, over EUAs, even if their EUA is still valid. Manufacturers should align their clinical studies and validation to support traditional submissions. However, these submissions are reviewed under standard MDUFA timelines and are not given EUA-level priority.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Should manufacturers prioritize preparing for traditional marketing submissions even if their EUA is still valid?
VERBATIM ANSWER: At this point, however, rather than pursuing an EUA or a modification to an EUA, the FDA is encouraging all manufacturers to submit traditional marketing submissions, such as 510ks, de novos, and possibly PMAs, in some cases. If you have an ongoing clinical study or you're otherwise planning for a future EUA request for a COVID-19 test, we recommend that you consider how your clinical study and other validation efforts may also support a traditional marketing submission, since we are encouraging all manufacturers to pursue traditional marketing submissions. That said, marketing submissions, including 510ks and de novos, are not prioritized in the same way that EUA requests have been. We do aim to review marketing submissions according to the timelines established under the Medical Device User Fee Amendment or MDUFA program.

QA Block 2-14
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How will the FDA ensure COVID-19 tests under EUA continue to meet accuracy and reliability standards if the 564 declaration persists?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA states that the EUA declaration for COVID-19 tests under Section 564 is still in effect, even after the May 11th PHE termination. This ensures the tests continue to meet accuracy and reliability standards, including addressing new variants.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How will the FDA ensure COVID-19 tests under EUA continue to meet accuracy and reliability standards if the 564 declaration persists?
VERBATIM ANSWER: As we've mentioned, the 319 and 564 are independent. The EUA declaration under 564 is continuing, and we expect that 180-day notice before it is terminated. Therefore, even after the PHE, the Public Health Emergency, termination on May 11th, the EUA declaration for COVID-19 IVDs is still in effect, including the EUA requirements for COVID-19 tests, and that does apply for LDTs. This will continue to help assure that COVID-19 tests remain appropriately accurate and reliable, including in the setting of new variants and sub-variants that we continue to see with COVID-19.

REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 2-15
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the specific requirements or criteria for LDTs to remain in compliance after termination of the EUA declaration?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA will continue EUA requirements for COVID-19 LDTs as long as the 564 declaration remains active, which helps ensure accuracy and reliability amidst evolving variants. After the EUA declaration ends, FDA plans to exercise the same enforcement approach for COVID-19 LDTs as it does for other LDTs.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the specific requirements or criteria for LDTs to remain in compliance after termination of the EUA declaration?
VERBATIM ANSWER: For LDTs in general, FDA has generally exercised enforcement discretion, as we've talked about, meaning that we don't exercise our authority to enforce regulatory requirements for LDTs, although we do have that authority. We don't apply the general enforcement discretion approach to certain LDTs, as I mentioned in the slides, including those used for declared emergencies under 564. As we've mentioned, the 319 and 564 are independent. The EUA declaration under 564 is continuing, and we expect that 180-day notice before it is terminated. Therefore, even after the PHE, the Public Health Emergency, termination on May 11th, the EUA declaration for COVID-19 IVDs is still in effect, including the EUA requirements for COVID-19 tests, and that does apply for LDTs. This will continue to help assure that COVID-19 tests remain appropriately accurate and reliable, including in the setting of new variants and sub-variants that we continue to see with COVID-19. Following termination of the EUA declaration, that's the 564 declaration, which we don't have a date yet for that termination, so that 564 declaration for COVID-19 IVDs, once that is terminated, we do intend to have the same enforcement approach for COVID-19 LDTs as we do for other LDTs.

QA Block 2-16
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is the use of low positive analysis for PPA evaluation during EUA submissions fundamentally incompatible with traditional marketing submissions?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA does not intend to use low positive analysis for traditional marketing authorizations. Traditional authorizations require robust overall performance, including a minimum PPA of 80% with lower confidence bounds of 70%. The use of low positive analysis during EUA authorization was based on unique pandemic factors, which have largely shifted.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is the use of low positive analysis for PPA evaluation during EUA submissions fundamentally incompatible with traditional marketing submissions?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So our recommendations to support a traditional marketing submission are different from our recommendations to support an EUA. And at this time, we don't intend to use this type of low positive analysis to support traditional marketing authorizations. Generally, we would expect robust overall performance observed in a prospective clinical study for COVID-19 antigen tests seeking traditional marketing authorization, with a minimum PPA of 80% and a lower bounds of the 95%, confidence interval of 70%. The special controls that such tests must meet are outlined in the FDA's recently granted de novo, and that's de novo number DEN220039. And this de novo was from the Quidel Corporation for the Sofia 2 SARS Antigen plus FIA. The low positive analysis used during the EUA authorization for some tests was based on a variety of factors that were kind of unique to the pandemic. This included high prevalence of reported COVID-19 cases, the viral load of the circulating variants at that time, and the frequent use of serial testing or otherwise repeated regular testing, such as workplace or school testing programs. This all led to a determination that the benefits of wide availability of OTC COVID-19 tests outweighed the potential risks of lower sensitivity. As these factors have now largely shifted with lower prevalence of reported COVID-19 cases, as well as reduced testing, FDA's recommendations for traditional marketing authorization do not include the use of a low positive analysis.

#### 3. Guidance on Serial Testing After Emergency Declaration Ends

QA Block 3-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the FDA have any recommendations on how clinicians can adhere to serial testing requirements for SARS-COV-2 antigen tests once the public health emergency ends?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends following the EUA-authorized instructions for use, allowing the mixing and matching of SARS-COV-2 antigen tests for serial testing. Follow-up tests do not need to match the initial test, and patients can perform follow-up tests at home if initially negative in a clinical setting.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA have any recommendations on how clinicians can adhere to serial testing requirements for SARS-COV-2 antigen tests once the public health emergency ends?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So it's important for all users, including health care providers and laboratories, to follow the EUA authorized instructions for use. However, when the instructions for these antigen tests say to include serial testing, the antigen tests can be mixed and matched. So the follow on of the serial COVID-19 tests, do not have to be the same as the first test. Additionally, if the patient is negative in the clinic, they can be instructed to perform the follow on tests at home.

#### 4. Post-EUA Compliance for COVID-19 Test Manufacturers

QA Block 4-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How should an IVD manufacturer approach meeting the design control requirements after the emergency use authorization termination date with an emergency use authorized test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA expects manufacturers to comply with 21 CFR Part 820 for EUA-authorized tests after the EUA termination date if a marketing submission is under review. Manufacturers should consult the FDA about possible compliance considerations and may request exemptions outlined in 21 CFR 820.1e and section 520 f2 of the FD&C Act, ideally within 90 days of the termination notice publication.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How should an IVD manufacturer approach meeting the design control requirements after the emergency use authorization termination date with an emergency use authorized test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Sure. Thanks, Joe. So for this question, as outlined in the EUA transition guidance, the FDA does not intend to object to continued distribution of devices that fall within the scope of the guidance if the manufacturer has submitted a marketing submission and it has been accepted by the FDA before the EUA termination date and where FDA has not taken a final action on the marketing submission. After the EUA termination date and while a marketing submission is under FDA review, FDA expects manufacturers to comply with the quality systems regulations under 21 CFR Part 820 for their EUA- authorized test. As discussed in the EUA transition guidance, FDA recognizes that there may be situations that raise unique compliance considerations, particularly regarding quality system requirements. FDA intends to take such considerations into account when making case-by-case compliance and enforcement decisions. Because these situations are nuanced and fact specific, some manufacturers who intend to continue distributing their devices after the EUA termination date may wish to have specific discussions with the agency, and we suggest initiating those discussions as soon as possible. In certain circumstances, some manufacturers who intend to continue distributing their devices after the EUA termination date may choose to request an exemption or variance from a device quality system requirement, and this is outlined in 21 CFR 820.1e and section 520 f2 of the FD&C Act.

#### 7. EUA vs. Full Marketing Submission for Diagnostics

QA Block 7-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: If a multiplex flow assay test is currently under clinical studies, should it gather sufficient data to meet a marketing submission directly, or go through an EUA first before a marketing submission?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Developers are encouraged to pursue full marketing submissions while preparing EUAs as needed. Developers should use the FDA's q-sub pre-sub process to align validation for both pathways. While COVID is still circulating, it is important to work toward full validation, though challenges exist for diseases with declining cases like MPOX.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If a multiplex flow assay test is currently under clinical studies, should it gather sufficient data to meet a marketing submission directly, or go through an EUA first before a marketing submission?
VERBATIM ANSWER: As Toby mentioned, as long as the 564 is open for IVDs and it meets our priority, we will review them. But we are encouraging developers to move to full marketing applications, so that's up to you. What I would do is if you're planning on still submitting an EUA that you reach out to us through the q-sub pre-sub process, free to developers. And in parallel, discuss what we're going to recommend for your full validation, so that you're working towards both. At this point, we're encouraging full market authorization submissions. We have a lot of tests on the market right now. There is still COVID circulating. We do want, while it's still circulating, which probably won't end, but who knows, we want to make sure that developers have a chance to fully validate their tests for marketing submissions. It is one of the reasons why some of the previous 564s have remained open, and that is that it's difficult to convert to marketing application if cases have decreased. For example, MPOX right now. There's nearly 0 in the US on a daily basis, not quite. And worldwide, actually. So it would really be hard to do full marketing submission. So those 564 authorities for the FDA are really valuable in making sure that there's tests on the market and they stay on the market as long as needed. Thanks.

QA Block 7-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Why does the FDA encourage developers to move to full marketing authorization submissions instead of relying only on EUAs?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA encourages developers to move to full marketing submissions to ensure validated tests remain available long-term, especially as COVID cases decline. EUAs are still an option, but the FDA prefers developers to focus on both EUA and market authorization pathways.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Why does the FDA encourage developers to move to full marketing authorization submissions instead of relying only on EUAs?
VERBATIM ANSWER: As Toby mentioned, as long as the 564 is open for IVDs and it meets our priority, we will review them. But we are encouraging developers to move to full marketing applications, so that's up to you. What I would do is if you're planning on still submitting an EUA that you reach out to us through the q-sub pre-sub process, free to developers. And in parallel, discuss what we're going to recommend for your full validation, so that you're working towards both. At this point, we're encouraging full market authorization submissions. We have a lot of tests on the market right now. There is still COVID circulating. We do want, while it's still circulating, which probably won't end, but who knows, we want to make sure that developers have a chance to fully validate their tests for marketing submissions. It is one of the reasons why some of the previous 564s have remained open, and that is that it's difficult to convert to marketing application if cases have decreased. For example, MPOX right now. There's nearly 0 in the US on a daily basis, not quite. And worldwide, actually. So it would really be hard to do full marketing submission. So those 564 authorities for the FDA are really valuable in making sure that there's tests on the market and they stay on the market as long as needed. Thanks.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does FDA have general guidance on whether real-world data, without comparator data, would be permitted to support a molecular test submission?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recognizes challenges with using real-world evidence (RWE) for IVD submissions and follows CDRH guidance to support its use. The FDA encourages systems to improve RWE collection and suggests using the Q-submission process to provide details for feedback.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does FDA have general guidance on whether real-world data, without comparator data, would be permitted to support a molecular test submission?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So we're aware of some of the challenges that exist for IVDs for using real-world evidence in data to support submissions. We abide by the CDRH guidance in this area and we encourage its use whenever possible because we do believe it can reduce the amount of work that a developer might do. There are situations out there that we're aware of, for some devices at least, where comparative testing with an adequate comparator might be available. It might not happen exactly on the same day and the same time. It might be within one day, for example. So we are encouraging data systems can be developed and deployed in the US so that going forward the real-world evidence can be more easily obtained by developers. And there's a whole project being led by Dr. Sara Brenner in our office on SHIELD project and on point-of-care devices and this issue of connectivity and data reporting with specific devices.
