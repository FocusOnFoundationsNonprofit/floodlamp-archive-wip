#### 1. FDA Updates on COVID-19 Testing and Submissions Priorities

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Do saliva collection devices or specimens added to VTM prior to testing need an EUA?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Yes, saliva collection devices or specimens added to VTM prior to testing require FDA authorization through EUA or full premarket review, as no FDA-cleared saliva collection devices exist for viral RNA. The FDA has issued three EUAs for such devices, and developers should review these authorizations and related templates for guidance.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Do saliva collection devices or specimens added to VTM prior to testing need an EUA?
VERBATIM ANSWER: There currently are no FDA cleared or approved saliva collection devices intended for use with viral RNA. Since these are not 510k exempt devices FDA authorization either through full premarket review or through EUA is required for these saliva collection devices. We have to date issued three EUA as I believe for saliva collection devices for use with SARS CoV-2 tests. And we recommend that you look at the authorization documents for those three EUAs as a reference point. Additionally, the home specimen collection molecular diagnostic template includes some recommendations including four analytical and clinical studies that may be applicable even if the selection - or sorry a unintelligible saliva collection device is not intended to be used for home specimen collection specifically.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: Saliva collection devices, EUA requirements, FDA guidance
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the FDA's current priorities for COVID-19 diagnostic testing?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA's current priorities for COVID-19 diagnostic testing include amendments for pooling and screening asymptomatic individuals to increase testing access, focusing on point-of-care, at-home collection, and central lab high-throughput diagnostic tests to expand testing capacity, reduce turnaround times, and manage the virus effectively, particularly in work and school environments.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the FDA's current priorities for COVID-19 diagnostic testing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: First I want to go over our current priorities. They remained largely obvious and unchanged. Of course we've issued new amendments recently pooling and screening asymptomatics. And for those tests that qualify for those amendments those are obviously priorities for us because they're both designed to increase access substantially for testing. And of course our continued focus on particularly on diagnostic tests for point of care in home and home collection of diagnostic tests remains top priority and as well central lab tests that are extremely high throughput tests. All of these again are designed to increase access to testing and hopefully decrease turnaround time and better and folks are better able to manage this virus and in particular as they go to work and go to school and as we prepare going back to school in the fall.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA encourages developers aiming for long-term market presence with SARS CoV-2 molecular tests to pursue submissions under the 510k pathway after the authorized de novo. They should prepare for full authorization by acquiring or banking necessary samples for analytical and clinical validation.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What options are available for developers interested in long-term market presence of SARS CoV-2 molecular tests under the 510k pathway?
VERBATIM ANSWER: For molecular, for the lion's share of molecular tests we've already authorized one de novo and that means all subsequent molecular submissions for SARS CoV-2 whether they be single analyte for SARS CoV-2 or a multi-analyte panel, they all, you know, they meet the other criteria, fall under that, the new pathway, continue with the 510k. For serology and for antigen tests, the first submissions will be de novo. Thereafter the lion's share of those will then also be 510ks. So we do actually urge folks developers who want to be in the market long term with the SARS CoV-2 test to begin turning their attention to this and preparing for full authorization and in particular making sure that they have the samples needed or banking of samples is allowed to do all the analytical work as well as the clinical validation that we expect for those full authorizations.

QA Block 1-9
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How does the FDA recommend developers address potential difficulties in obtaining positive samples for validation as infection rates decline?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA advises developers to prioritize securing necessary samples for full validation now, as infection rates may decline further, making positive samples harder to obtain.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How does the FDA recommend developers address potential difficulties in obtaining positive samples for validation as infection rates decline?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We hope that the, you know, there's what of about 40,000 new infections a day in the US right now, it's still substantial. We do hope that that continues to fall and it falls greatly. So we have seen following prior emergencies where developers when they turn attention to moving towards a full authorization, the positive samples fell off and they struggled at times at forgetting positive samples. So I just bring that up because I think, you know, the FDA is obviously interested in full authorizations and I think developers are too and I wanted to bring this up.

However it may be easier for some developers who want to monitor performance with respect to certain mutations and variants to use engineered antigens, you know, recombinant antigens in particular because they can engineer in the mutation. I'm not sure if that's going to be sufficient only in assessing change and potential performance with mutations, but certainly it's a good thought and we're open to that just, you know, for verifying performance on mutations. So that's one area where recombinant antigen production may be entirely useful in addressing concerns. And we look forward to having conversations with developers on this to make sure that's addressed in any potential concerns the FDA may have.

#### 5. Monitoring Antibody Tests Against SARS-CoV-2 Variants

QA Block 5-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How many samples of each SARS-CoV-2 variant are required to be evaluated for monitoring the performance of a lateral flow antibody test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA does not currently have specific recommendations for the number of SARS-CoV-2 variant-related serology samples required for evaluating test performance. However, EUA requests should include plans for monitoring variants, assessing impacts of prevalent or significant mutations, and mitigating risks from test performance uncertainties. Variant data should include how samples were selected, characterized, and validated.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How many samples of each SARS-CoV-2 variant are required to be evaluated for monitoring the performance of a lateral flow antibody test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: At this time we don't have specific recommendations for the number of SARS CoV-2 variant related serology samples that should be evaluated by wet testing to monitor the performance of SARS CoV-2 serology test. In your EUA request we would like to see your plan for monitoring for a new and emerging SARS CoV-2 viral mutations and variants. And we would expect your plan to include assessing the potential impact of mutations and variance that have been identified as prevalent or clinically significant on the performance of your test. Testing is not expected for every variant that you monitor, but for mutations, the variance that has been identified as prevalent or clinically significant, you should provide information on the potential impact on your test performance considering your specific captured antigen and test technology or explain how the risk associated with the unknown performance of your device in samples from individuals with the variant can be adequately mitigated. And then when variant data is provided we would expect you to describe how the serology samples were selected and characterized and described the sequencing map is used to cross specific variants.

#### 7. Challenges in Validating Saliva Antigen Tests

QA Block 7-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can artificial saliva, fresh saliva, or commercially sourced saliva be used as the clinical matrix for a saliva antigen test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA advises submitting a pre-EUA for saliva antigen tests and does not currently permit completely artificial samples. Banked or contrived samples are generally acceptable for analytical studies, but saliva as a sample type for antigen tests is challenging. No saliva-based antigen test has been authorized yet.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can artificial saliva, fresh saliva, or commercially sourced saliva be used as the clinical matrix for a saliva antigen test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: You know, I recommend submitting a pre-EUA for your saliva antigen test and your plans.

And it's an artificial increase in assay sensitivity that is hard to control and understand. And we really want to understand real-world performance. So, you know, anything that doesn't follow sort of, you know, an, you know, our sort of standard recommendations for antigen tests, again I do recommend that you submit a pre-EUA and ask for any, you know, flexibility that you need to develop your test. But molecular is a little bit different because they typically have an extraction step and, you know, for those essays that - although we do examine about whether freeze-thaw does impact molecular as well so we do ask for freestyle studies.

#### 8. Delays in COVID Test Decision Summary Publication

QA Block 8-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Will the decision summary for the BioFire de novo assay definitely be made available?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA cannot predict when the decision summary for the BioFire de novo assay will be available. It must first go through a process to assess proprietary information, which is beyond FDA's control.
VERBATIM QUESTION: You mentioned in several of the meetings of the desire to move towards full approval for COVID tests. And the only one that you've approved is the de novo from BioFire. And it would be most helpful I would think for developers to see the decision summary for that assay which is still not available according to the database. So I'm wondering if you could shed any light on when and if that decision summary will be made available?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes I mean Toby will know the exact protocol for these to get posted, but it goes through a process of looking for any proprietary information that about the assay that we authorized that shouldn't be disclosed publicly. So it leaves our office and it's go through this process and we're not entirely in control of it and we can't, just like guidance, we can't predict when it's going to come out. However for those developers for molecular serology and antigen tests that want to pursue full authorization, as I said we're accepting Pre-Subs for COVID related applications.

#### 9. Standards for Bio-Specimens in Diagnostic Test Validation

QA Block 9-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can you restate the CDRH position on what is acceptable for a bio-repository test versus a live specimen for molecular and antibody tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: For central lab and high complexity tests, frozen samples are largely acceptable if freeze-thaw studies show no adverse effects. For point-of-care or home tests, using banked samples poses challenges and should go through processes like pre-EUA to address potential biases.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can you restate the CDRH position on what is acceptable for a bio-repository test versus a live specimen for molecular and antibody tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: I think we for central lab tests and moderate and high complexity labs test authorization, frozen samples are largely acceptable for that. We'll want to see freeze-thaw studies to make sure that they behave the same, you know, seeing in paired samples. When you move into point-of-care or home situations that's where it gets a little bit more tricky. I don't know if our current templates spell out the use of banked samples, but we always do recommend that if you're going to use bank samples for your analytical and/or clinical studies that you do check through the pre-EUA process and if you're going for full authorization through the precept process to make sure that your design of studies using bank samples, you know, mitigates completely or to the extent it can be any sort of bias.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Would the sensitivity minimum limits be different for a home use or point-of-care test versus a centralized laboratory test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Yes, sensitivity minimum limits differ for home use or point-of-care tests versus centralized lab tests. For molecular and serology tests, templates specify requirements. For point-of-care and home molecular tests, 80% PPA is the recommended minimum. FDA evaluates thresholds based on specific applications and templates outline these details.
VERBATIM QUESTION: With regard to a home use test would the sensitivity minimum limits be different in for the home use or point-of-care test versus a centralized laboratory test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes clinical sensitivity or positive percent agreement to a comparator or to the, you know, the test of record, you know, for molecular and serology they would be different answers for that. I think we have - well I know that the home template for antigen molecular spells this out. And then I think we have a home collection template for serology. So you should be able to get a good idea. Basically for serology testing we're really sort of have set levels of sensitivity or PPA recommendations as well as specificity or MPA. For - and for home - and for point of care molecular it's 80% is the floor that we recommend. We really like to see good concordance to central and molecular tests for all molecular tests whether they be in-home or point-of-care. But we will authorize molecular tests between 80% and 95% PPA compared to a high sensitivity central molecular tests. And the same thing for home molecular tests. And then there are various thresholds for different applications such as if you want OTC and there's different pathways for the OTC. And those are all laid out fairly clearly in our templates so I'm not going to go over those again right now.

#### 10. Prioritizing High Throughput Tests for Asymptomatic Screening

QA Block 10-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the FDA priority for asymptomatic amendments also extend to new submissions for asymptomatic testing?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA prioritizes high-throughput asymptomatic screening tests. New submissions that do not meet prioritization criteria, such as high throughput and point-of-care access, will not be prioritized but can pursue the regular authorization pathway.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA priority for asymptomatic amendments also extend to new submissions for asymptomatic testing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes with the central lab test we are also asking for, you know, it be a high throughput test. So a low-throughput test isn't really going to advance our capability as a country to address the huge numbers of tests that are needed for asymptomatically screening our population. And we're really driving development priorities towards those extremely high throughput tests. And those are the ones that we're prioritizing so simply a new submission, you know, adding asymptomatic screening that doesn't also meet our access. Our access is point-of-care in-home. But if it's a central - if it's moderate to high complexity test and it doesn't have - and it doesn't meet the throughput template it's not going to be prioritized right now and it probably won't be going forward. The regular full authorization pathway it is open to test developers who don't meet our pandemic priorities, you know, which are probably going to be, you know, pretty similar going forward.

VERBATIM QUESTION: What does it mean for a test to be 'deemed waived' under an EUA?
VERBATIM ANSWER: And just for clarity under law, under federal law it's our office that is the office that under normal circumstances categorizes tests as high, moderate or waived. Under EUA, we are not making formal categorizations, but it is still falls to our office to do this. And so we're calling it deeming a test for categorization. This most - mostly applies to those tests that we're deeming as waived and we're not currently till those tests come for full authorization we are not doing a formal categorization.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What role does FDA play in test categorization when CMS changes payment policies or coding?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA determines test settings under EUA, parallel to CLIA categorization under full marketing. Under law, FDA categorizes tests (high, moderate, or waived). CMS handles lab certification and payment policies. Issues appear to stem from payment coding misunderstandings.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What role does FDA play in test categorization when CMS changes payment policies or coding?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So again they have not re-categorized. Their - what they point out is specific to payment and is a coding issue. The FDA is responsible for, you know, outside of an emergency, we do a CLIA categorization. Under the EUA we don't do a formal categorization but we authorize for specific settings which is sort of parallel to that CLIA categorization that we would do on a full marketing submission. But their - that does fall under FDA, the determining what settings a test can be used in under that authorization. The CLIA and CMS side is, you know, authorized on the CLIA side authorizing or certifying the labs for a specific level of testing and on the reimbursement and payment side of things determining what gets paid for. And I think that this really is a misunderstanding based on possibly the way that they worded their document, I'm not sure, and they'll be able to resolve that.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: How does the communication between FDA and CMS affect diagnostic test developers?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA works with CMS to address communication issues related to diagnostic tests. For specific inquiries such as coding and payment, developers are encouraged to contact CMS directly since any misunderstandings likely stem from their documentation or coding guidelines.
VERBATIM QUESTION: IMPLICIT
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. This has come up - I'm not going to be able to give you full information because it really is out of CMS and so we'll recommend that you reach out to CMS. If you email the CLIA program they'll be able to address your question. There is what I understand from talking to our CMS colleagues is that there's a misunderstanding and there's not - they're - they haven't re-categorized anything. The Quidel Sofia is authorized under their EUA for point of care which is CLIA certificate of waiver setting. And if your reach out to CMS they'll be able to clarify the payment side of things for you.

#### 12. Defining Point-of-Care Settings for Clinical Research Sites

QA Block 12-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Do clinical research organization sites qualify as a point of care setting?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: It depends. FDA generally sees typical busy primary care clinics as point-of-care settings. Other settings may qualify but need to be discussed with FDA through a pre-EUA submission.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Do clinical research organization sites qualify as a point of care setting?
VERBATIM ANSWER: I think so. I mean it depends. We're really looking in the point-of-care studies the typical setting is a typical busy, you know, primary care sort of facility. And we're looking for the ability of folks and, you know, healthcare workers who are not trained in laboratory and in the midst of their busy daily schedules to be able to use the test and get accurate results because in the real world that's what's happening. And if you've ever been to a busy point of care clinic these folks, they're juggling a lot of balls. And want to make sure that the device is robust enough, the instructions are robust enough that they still get accurate results. So that is the ideal. If you're contemplating settings other than what I just described I would recommend submitting a pre-EUA and describing it and getting and having a discussion with our staff on whether that's appropriate or not.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What type of comparator does the FDA recommend for a lateral flow rapid antigen test clinical study with nasal samples?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends using a high-sensitivity PCR test with a nasal specimen as the comparator for clinical studies of lateral flow rapid antigen tests. Saliva specimens and antigen tests are not acceptable as comparators.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What type of comparator does the FDA recommend for a lateral flow rapid antigen test clinical study with nasal samples?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We do recommend a high-sensitivity PCR using a nasal specimen as a comparator. Neither saliva specimens nor antigen tests are acceptable comparators. You should select a high-sensitivity PCR that is authorized for home collection and use the home collection kit with which that selected comparator test is authorized.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What would be acceptable to use as the clinical matrix for a saliva antigen test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA suggests submitting a pre-EUA for saliva antigen tests. Artificial samples are not allowed, but banked or contrived samples (e.g., pooled saliva spiked with inactivated virus) can be used for analytical studies. Saliva is considered a challenging sample type for antigen tests.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What would be acceptable to use as the clinical matrix for a saliva antigen test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: You know, I recommend submitting a pre-EUA for your saliva antigen test and your plans. Typically we won't allow, you know, completely artificial samples for anything right now including saliva. And the use of banked samples especially for analytical study is fine. The use of contrived samples is generally okay for analytical studies meaning you take a negative patient saliva or pooled saliva and you spike in virus, whole virus inactivated will work. Or you can dilute a positive patient saliva sample into a negative pool in order to get the dilutions that you, you know, would want for your analytical studies. But again we don't have recommendations out there on validation of saliva antigen tests. We do think that's a particularly challenging sample type for antigen tests.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Why are freeze-thaw studies required for molecular testing and how do they differ from the requirements for antigen testing?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Freeze-thaw studies are required for molecular testing to assess any potential impacts, as molecular tests typically include an extraction step. Antigen tests, on the other hand, show a consistent sensitivity increase with the freeze-thaw cycle, which could lead to artificial results and does not reflect real-world performance.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Why are freeze-thaw studies required for molecular testing and how do they differ from the requirements for antigen testing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Antigen tests are more challenging because we've observed that the freeze-thaw process seems to increase access shall we say to the antigen. And it's an artificial increase in assay sensitivity that is hard to control and understand. And we really want to understand real-world performance. So, you know, anything that doesn't follow sort of, you know, an, you know, our sort of standard recommendations for antigen tests, again I do recommend that you submit a pre-EUA and ask for any, you know, flexibility that you need to develop your test. But molecular is a little bit different because they typically have an extraction step and, you know, for those essays that - although we do examine about whether freeze-thaw does impact molecular as well so we do ask for freestyle studies. But with antigen it's been pretty consistent that the sensitivity increases with the freeze-thaw cycle.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: When will the decision summary for the BioFire de novo assay be made available?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA cannot predict when the decision summary for the BioFire de novo assay will be available as it must undergo a review process to check for proprietary information. The FDA will post it as soon as possible.
VERBATIM QUESTION: When will the decision summary for the BioFire de novo assay be made available?
VERBATIM ANSWER: It goes through a process of looking for any proprietary information that about the assay that we authorized that shouldn't be disclosed publicly. So it leaves our office and it's go through this process and we're not entirely in control of it and we can't, just like guidance, we can't predict when it's going to come out. However for those developers for molecular serology and antigen tests that want to pursue full authorization, as I said we're accepting Pre-Subs for COVID related applications. And as soon as we can post that that decision, we will.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the sensitivity limit requirements for a centralized laboratory test versus a home use or point-of-care test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA stated that the minimum sensitivity (PPA) for home or point-of-care molecular tests is 80%, with authorization granted for results between 80% and 95% PPA when compared to high-sensitivity centralized molecular tests. Specific thresholds for serology and other applications are provided in templates.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the sensitivity limit requirements for a centralized laboratory test versus a home use or point-of-care test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes clinical sensitivity or positive percent agreement to a comparator or to the, you know, the test of record, you know, for molecular and serology they would be different answers for that. I think we have - well I know that the home template for antigen molecular spells this out. And then I think we have a home collection template for serology. So you should be able to get a good idea. Basically for serology testing we're really sort of have set levels of sensitivity or PPA recommendations as well as specificity or MPA. For - and for home - and for point of care molecular it's 80% is the floor that we recommend. We really like to see good concordance to central and molecular tests for all molecular tests whether they be in-home or point-of-care. But we will authorize molecular tests between 80% and 95% PPA compared to a high sensitivity central molecular tests. And the same thing for home molecular tests. And then there are various thresholds for different applications such as if you want OTC and there's different pathways for the OTC. And those are all laid out fairly clearly in our templates so I'm not going to go over those again right now.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can CLIA re-categorize testing devices?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: CLIA does not re-categorize testing devices; this responsibility falls under the FDA, which categorizes tests into high, moderate, or waived. Under EUA, tests are deemed for categorization rather than formally categorized. CLIA focuses on lab certifications.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can CLIA re-categorize testing devices?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So again they have not re-categorized. Their - what they point out is specific to payment and is a coding issue. The FDA is responsible for, you know, outside of an emergency, we do a CLIA categorization. Under the EUA we don't do a formal categorization but we authorize for specific settings which is sort of parallel to that CLIA categorization that we would do on a full marketing submission. But their - that does fall under FDA, the determining what settings a test can be used in under that authorization. The CLIA and CMS side is, you know, authorized on the CLIA side authorizing or certifying the labs for a specific level of testing and on the reimbursement and payment side of things determining what gets paid for. And I think that this really is a misunderstanding based on possibly the way that they worded their document, I'm not sure, and they'll be able to resolve that.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the FDA policy for receiving EUA submissions for antibody tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA continues to review EUA submissions for serology tests, including point-of-care, home collection, and high-throughput central lab tests if they are complete. However, lateral flow assays validated only for high-complexity labs are not currently prioritized.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the FDA policy for receiving EUA submissions for antibody tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: That's incorrect on serology tests but we are on - if a test is not high throughput we are declining to review as part of a prioritization process. So if someone say has a lateral flow assay and they're only validating it for a high complexity lab that's not currently meeting our priority. Serology tests that are point of care home collection we're still reviewing if they are complete applications. And if they are high throughput tests, central lab tests as we've authorized a number of them, we are continuing to review those. So I'm not sure where you get your information but it's not correct.
