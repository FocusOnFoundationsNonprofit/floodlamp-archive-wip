#### 1. FDA Updates on COVID-19 Testing Policies and Guidance

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the lab need to validate each transport media for the CDC EUA test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Labs can make changes to an EUA device, including transport media, independently and should validate these changes with a bridging study. The FDA does not require submission of these studies, but labs can share their data voluntarily to aid others.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the lab need to validate each transport media for the CDC EUA test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So labs under our updated guidance are able to make such changes on their own to an EUA device. That could include their own EUA that they've attained if they're laboratory developed test or if they obtain an EUA kit from a manufacturing source. They are - we expect that they will do the appropriate validation before they implement those changes under a so-called bridging study. You can reach out to the FDA if you have any questions about that. We do not ask for those bridging studies to be submitted to the FDA although if you do them and you think it might be useful to other labs and you wish to share that data and that information if you send that voluntarily to the FDA we will review that data and if we can put that on to our Frequently Asked Questions page based on the data that you generated we will in order to help all labs and perhaps only one lab really needs to do this. But if it is something that is already on our Frequently Asked Questions page we view those as mix and match. And we thank CMS and CLIA who have updated through an announcement that they are allowing lab directors to make the decision about whether additional validation is needed in the case where the FDA has already listed these options on our Frequently Asked Questions page. So hopefully that addresses that question appropriately. Thank you.

QA Block 1-6
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Which serology assays are currently being offered under Policy D?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Policy D serology tests include rapid IgG and IgM antibody finger stick tests, which are not FDA authorized but can be used with proper labeling and healthcare provider guidance. At-home serology tests need FDA authorization.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Which serology assays are currently being offered under Policy D?
VERBATIM ANSWER: These are typically the serology tests that are listed under Policy D on our Frequently Asked Question page. These are typically rapid finger stick tests for IgG and IgM and IgM antibodies. The FDA we recognize that these types of devices have a critical place in the fight against coronavirus. These tests results should not be used alone to make a diagnosis but are helpful in identifying who may have already been infected and their immune status response. The FDA's diagnostics policy allows these tests to be used, and I have a quote, without FDA authorization as long as these tests are labeled appropriately, including a statement that they cannot be used as the sole basis for diagnosis or exclusion of infection. Results should be obtained and used in complication with the healthcare provider. No at-home serology test are exempt meaning they need authorization from the FDA for the setting. To date we have not in fact authorized a serology assay.

TOPICS: Policy B notification process, Manufacturer compliance, EUA number clarification
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 3-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the minimum study design requirements for evaluating the validity and accuracy of foreign diagnostic tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA expects a minimum of 30 positive patients, including IgM alone and IgG cases, for evaluating foreign diagnostic tests. They recommend panels of immune serum to test cross-reactivity with non-SARS coronaviruses. In their absence, a panel of at least 75 non-SARS patients with negative SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is acceptable. Variety in negatives is also important.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the minimum study design requirements for evaluating the validity and accuracy of foreign diagnostic tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: I would just say in general that we would expect to see a minimum for good testing of these devices a minimum of say 30 positive patients, positive with some obviously IgM alone some that are going to have IgM and IgG. The number of patients in the US now with only IgG is probably limited and we understand that and we wouldn't necessarily expect to see that. You know, that's a bare minimum. It would be nice if possible to get 30 IgMs and 30 IgGs and some of them can be overlapping. The other general advice that we're giving for the validation of these kinds of devices is that it may be very difficult to get panels of immune serum. In particular we want to know if there's cross-reactivity with any non-SARS coronaviruses that normally circulate during respiratory season than perhaps other times of the year. There are four main types that we - I think we have listed in our - in one of our - in our templates and we would of course love to see immune serum against those in more than single isolates. That would be the best test to know if the SARS COVID-2 rapid tests are specific for Com SARS CV2. But in the absence of that we are allowing developers to test a panel of at least 75 non-SARS CV patients who should be negative for antibodies against SARS CV2. We would expect to see as much variety in those negatives as possible and where possible know the immune status for some of the common respiratory viruses.

#### 12. Serology Test Validation and Positive Material Sourcing Challenges

QA Block 12-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the FDA have a source or can it recommend a source of positive material for validation of serology tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA does not currently have a source of positive material for serology test validation, but foreign suppliers might have panels, which necessitate quality checks. The FDA and other agencies are working on developing resources in the U.S. Updates will be posted on the FAQ page.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA have a source or can it recommend a source of positive material for validation of serology tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So obviously negatives in the United States should still be easily obtained especially if they are banked from prior to the epidemic. We are aware that our - there are foreign suppliers of panels of serologies that would be appropriate for this however we don't necessarily know the quality of that. So we would certainly look to you to ensure that the quality of these panels is good and accurate for what you intend for it to do. If you were to have any trouble importing those do let us know at our cdrh- eua-templates address and we will work with you on any potential import issues so that you can do this validation. We are reaching out to a number of entities in the United States in order to facilitate the collection and development of panels of immune serum for SARS COV-2. This is actually an interagency effort now involving CDC, BARDA, ASPR and the FDA. And we are in the beginning stages of this work and so I can't report any success at the moment but we will be updating our Frequently Asked Questions page with regard to resources that could be used. In the interim I know that there is at least one lab in New York that has begun offering a test probably because New York is one of the states that can authorize their own SARS CV tests. So there may be others in New York that are under this or when we are able to authorize the serology test whether that's an LDT or a manufactured test that could - anybody who utilizes that test or that testing service could potentially identify such immune serum.

While these tests can be marketed, verification of performance is recommended. Efforts are underway to establish a federal third-party validation program with plans to make validation data public.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How thoroughly is the FDA evaluating the validation data submitted by manufacturers under the part D Pathway?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, no that's a very excellent question. We came up with this pathway to expedite tests that were not for sole diagnosis to get onto the market. We have a parallel path where there is a full EUA authorization review that's open to these developers. And we would encourage them to come through that pathway. But for the time being they cannot claim FDA authorization. We are solely allowing them to be marketed. So I would urge those that buy these tests is to do some sort of verification of the performance. That's not required but I think it's only wise. We are aware of the Spanish situation and particularly the business insider article. And it's why we are currently standing up this federal effort. We hope and we have already begun inviting these serology test providers to come in voluntarily to undergo a third party validation program. We are just in the beginning stages of that.

#### 14. Saliva and Nasopharyngeal Sampling for SARS-CoV-2 Detection

QA Block 14-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the FDA have any data on the acceptability of a saliva sample for detecting SARS-CoV-2 using nucleic acid methods?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA has some data on saliva as a sample type for nucleic acid diagnostics, including studies showing poor correlation for tongue swabs compared to nasopharyngeal samples. More research is needed to evaluate saliva's acceptability, and FDA would require EUA amendments to review data for authorization before widespread adoption.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA have any data on the acceptability of a saliva sample for detecting SARS-CoV-2 using nucleic acid methods?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Okay. So we have developers both for serology. You can, you know, do things like IgA in saliva but we have quite a bit of interest in other sample types for nucleic acid-based testing. We in the United healthcare group study which I still don't know if it's been published yet we looked at what was it tongue swab which may simulate somewhat saliva or it may not because there's not a whole lot of volume there and more volume of saliva make a difference. But anyways in that comparison there was not good correlation between the cycle thresholds of the tongue sampling and a swab and the nasopharyngeal comparator. There was actually no correlation to CT. So we became a little bit concerned at least with the tongue swab. I do not know if a higher volume of saliva would work better. We do have parties who are interested in going forward with saliva tests. Because it is a new anatomical site we would want to do for any LDTs or any manufactured tests we would want to have an EUA amendment to review that data before we authorize it. And then obviously once we make saliva available as a reliable sample type from an anatomical site then we can make that widely known. Hopefully that addresses your question.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: If the FDA were to approve nasopharyngeal sample collection in a home setting, would it need to be observed via telemedicine?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA has concerns about performing nasopharyngeal sample collection at home due to risks like self-harm or improper methods. The agency is more focused on simpler and safer options like anterior nasal swab collection, which has shown promise in studies.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If the FDA were to approve nasopharyngeal sample collection in a home setting, would it need to be observed via telemedicine?
VERBATIM ANSWER: It's not the - I mean of course if someone comes in with data and says that patients can do this and they have no on results but I don't I would advise against it. There - I think there is - there's danger of self-harm or from someone else doing it improperly. Also it tends to make patients sneeze and cough which could…make, you know, infectivity increase. So we have already seen data that says the interior nasal swab particularly the only swab that has been validated in that in a unintelligible site right now is the round foam swab. We know of others who are validating other swabs that could be used for interior nasal but I think in the home care setting if someone wants to pursue that, an interior nasal swab in both nostrils need to be sampled. And then, you know, if it's a simple safe device, that's something that in the home setting that we want to take a look at. But the United Health study already demonstrated that interior nasal swab could be self-collected. So that's not approved. What we are looking for is on home collection at this point for something like that because that is the media that's used, is it safe for the home environment? And is a sample that is returned from a home setting through a shipping is it intact so that you have no false negatives from that transport of that. And if it uses - happens to use media that's already been FDA cleared for such transport then maybe that isn't needed but it's usually typically a simple in lab bench study to demonstrate that the temperatures that the sample may be exposed to near the LOD of the assay with a sufficient replicates that you can demonstrate adequate performance from a shipment from the home setting.

QA Block 14-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the FDA's position on nasopharyngeal sample collection in a remote setting?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA advises against self-collection of nasopharyngeal samples due to potential risks like self-harm, improper technique, and increased infectivity from sneezing and coughing. The FDA prefers validated alternatives, such as interior nasal swabs, which may be safe for home collection with appropriate studies to ensure reliable transport and performance.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the FDA's position on nasopharyngeal sample collection in a remote setting?
VERBATIM ANSWER: It's not the - I mean of course if someone comes in with data and says that patients can do this and they have no on results but I don't I would advise against it. There - I think there is - there's danger of self-harm or from someone else doing it improperly. Also it tends to make patients sneeze and cough which could…make, you know, infectivity increase. So we have already seen data that says the interior nasal swab particularly the only swab that has been validated in that in a unintelligible site right now is the round foam swab. We know of others who are validating other swabs that could be used for interior nasal but I think in the home care setting if someone wants to pursue that, an interior nasal swab in both nostrils need to be sampled. And then, you know, if it's a simple safe device, that's something that in the home setting that we want to take a look at. But the United Health study already demonstrated that interior nasal swab could be self-collected. So that's not approved. What we are looking for is on home collection at this point for something like that because that is the media that's used, is it safe for the home environment? And is a sample that is returned from a home setting through a shipping is it intact so that you have no false negatives from that transport of that. And if it uses - happens to use media that's already been FDA cleared for such transport then maybe that isn't needed but it's usually typically a simple in lab bench study to demonstrate that the temperatures that the sample may be exposed to near the LOD of the assay with a sufficient replicates that you can demonstrate adequate performance from a shipment from the home setting.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the significance of saliva collection volume in testing for SARS-CoV-2?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA observed in a study that tongue swabs, which might simulate saliva, showed no significant correlation in cycle thresholds compared to nasopharyngeal samples, possibly due to limited volume. It is unclear if a larger saliva volume would improve results.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the significance of saliva collection volume in testing for SARS-CoV-2?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We in the United healthcare group study which I still don't know if it's been published yet we looked at what was it tongue swab which may simulate somewhat saliva or it may not because there's not a whole lot of volume there and more volume of saliva make a difference. But anyways in that comparison there was not good correlation between the cycle thresholds of the tongue sampling and a swab and the nasopharyngeal comparator. There was actually no correlation to CT. So we became a little bit concerned at least with the tongue swab. I do not know if a higher volume of saliva would work better.

VERBATIM QUESTION: What data or validation is FDA seeking to authorize saliva as a reliable sample type under EUA?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We've been - I presume you mean by nucleic acid methods? Okay. So we have developers both for serology. You can, you know, do things like IgA in saliva but we have quite a bit of interest in other sample types for nucleic acid-based testing. We in the United healthcare group study which I still don't know if it's been published yet we looked at what was it tongue swab which may simulate somewhat saliva or it may not because there's not a whole lot of volume there and more volume of saliva make a difference.

There was actually no correlation to CT. So we became a little bit concerned at least with the tongue swab. I do not know if a higher volume of saliva would work better.

VERBATIM ANSWER: In particular we want to know if there's cross-reactivity with any non-SARS coronaviruses that normally circulate during respiratory season than perhaps other times of the year. There are four main types that we - I think we have listed in our - in one of our - in our templates and we would of course love to see immune serum against those in more than single isolates. That would be the best test to know if the SARS COVID-2 rapid tests are specific for Com SARS CV2. But in the absence of that we are allowing developers to test a panel of at least 75 non-SARS CV patients who should be negative for antibodies against SARS CV2. We would expect to see as much variety in those negatives as possible and where possible know the immune status for some of the common respiratory viruses.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What identifier does the FDA issue after reviewing marketing materials under Policy B, and how is it used to track a device?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: After reviewing marketing materials under Policy B, the FDA issues a number to the manufacturer to identify and track the device in the future. This number is not an EUA authorization number.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What identifier does the FDA issue after reviewing marketing materials under Policy B, and how is it used to track a device?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, so what we're doing is we're taking a look at their marketing materials and making sure that they fall appropriately under this policy and that they be following this policy and we try to turn that around quickly. And once we have made that decision and informed them we will issue them a number. That is not an EUA number as some have confused that. That is not EUA authorization number, but that is a number so that we can identify that device going forward in the future.

QA Block 10-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the FDA's guidelines for defining 'near patient testing' or 'point of care testing'?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA defines 'near patient testing' or 'point of care testing' as testing conducted in patient care settings outside of clinical laboratories, performed by appropriately trained individuals in locations such as hospitals, physician offices, urgent care, outreach clinics, and temporary care sites. This does not include home or specimen collection unless specified.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the FDA's guidelines for defining 'near patient testing' or 'point of care testing'?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We will note terms like patient care setting outside of the clinical laboratory environment or near patient testing or point of care in our EUA authorizations. And this generally refers to settings that where appropriately trained individuals are able to perform the tests and may include settings such as hospitals, physician offices, urgent care, outreach clinics and temporary patient care settings. These terms generally do not apply to home collection, specimen collection or home testing unless otherwise specified.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE

REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 15-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is there currently a prescribed template for home use serology EUAs?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: No, there is no prescribed FDA template currently for home use serology EUAs, and clinician involvement is critical for interpreting results.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is there currently a prescribed template for home use serology EUAs?
VERBATIM ANSWER: No, we haven't been approached by multiple developers in this area. And the other thing is how does a patient interpret the result too? So that's why it's really important for a clinician, healthcare provider to be involved in that part of the assay as well.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Erika Almardi
