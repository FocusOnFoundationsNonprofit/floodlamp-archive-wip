#### 1. Positive Predictive Value Challenges in Low-Prevalence Populations

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What alternative options are available to developers if the FDA defers providing direct feedback to pre-EUA questions readily answered in posted templates?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA will defer direct feedback on pre-EUA questions that can be fully answered using posted templates. Instead, relevant sections will be sent via email alongside the full template to streamline responses.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What alternative options are available to developers if the FDA defers providing direct feedback to pre-EUA questions readily answered in posted templates?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The first thing that - relative to pre-EUA submissions, if a question that is asked in a pre-EUA is something that can be answered clearly and directly from a template that we've already posted, we will defer to that and not generally provide any more direct feedback. This will really help us triage these questions because we spend a great deal of time on unintelligible the templates and keeping them as up to date as we can. I've directed the office staff to cut and paste the relevant section into the email, if you send it by email, as well as to attach the full template. So I'm hoping that, that works for everybody because that would be a very efficient way of handling this.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: pre-EUA feedback, posted templates, efficiency in responses
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How can test developers plan for managing false positives in low prevalence populations when using rapid antigen tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends confirming positive results of rapid antigen tests when used in low-prevalence populations, due to the increased likelihood of false positives. Developers should plan to reflex positive individuals to a secondary test for rapid confirmation.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How can test developers plan for managing false positives in low prevalence populations when using rapid antigen tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Next I wanted to revisit positive predictive value. It is - we get frequent questions about the application of positive predictive value, in particular I think for - currently, for rapid antigen tests. So everybody has seen various publications about potential false positives as there have been rollout and use in lower percent positive populations in nursing homes and other settings. And I just want to reiterate the value of looking at positive predictive value in assessing what to do with a positive result, specifically for a direct antigen test. But it can apply to any diagnostic test including molecular tests. Because in general, if the percent positivity is low in these populations, even with the relatively specific test, the number of false positives can be significant. FDA Virtual TH And therefore, we have recommended that, and the CDC does as well, that you confirm those results before taking any potential action, especially in regards patients. Obviously there's less - potentially less impact on healthcare workers if they have the false positive that can be confirmed to be false positive within a day or so. And then they don't need to be further quarantined if there's no other indication to do so. But with the patients there can be obviously a little bit more disruption. So it is very beneficial to have a plan in place to - when you utilize these tests, to have a plan in place to rapidly reflex those positive individuals to a second test. And work out a way that we can get a fairly rapid turnaround time on those critical.

#### 5. Saliva Sensitivity and Antibody Immunity Testing Challenges

QA Block 5-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Was the FDA's concern about saliva sensitivity based on collected data or a general concern?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA's concern about saliva sensitivity is based on data they have seen, which highlights a potential issue. They are open to saliva as a sample type but require data to support its use.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Was the FDA's concern about saliva sensitivity based on collected data or a general concern?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So we have seen data to this effect. And it does, you know, obviously alert us to a potential issue. There was also a recent press report about two different developers who reported they have decided and rapid antigen tests could not - have decided not to pursue saliva as a sample type. So the FDA remains open to it. But we want to see the data to support its use.

QA Block 5-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the FDA have any data on saliva sensitivity for antigen tests that can be made available to manufacturers?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA cannot share confidential company information publicly. Manufacturers may contact companies named in press reports to seek relevant data. For saliva-based antigen tests, selecting the correct antigen target and properly handling the sample are important.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA have any data on saliva sensitivity for antigen tests that can be made available to manufacturers?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We cannot share any confidential - any company confidential information with the public. Those companies are welcome to share that. So, you know, the companies were named in that press report so you're free to approach them and ask them for anything that they might have that might help you. But typically, you know, a rapid antigen test, the sample type, you know, whether it's, you know, nasal swab or nasopharyngeal swab, it would go directly into some sort of lysis buffer, you know, and then onto the device.

QA Block 5-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Would the FDA allow a home antibody test to claim some degree of immunity without requiring the manufacturer to conduct studies proving immunity?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA would not authorize a home antibody test to claim immunity without data proving immunity, as such claims are difficult to substantiate and could put individuals at risk.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Would the FDA allow a home antibody test to claim some degree of immunity without requiring the manufacturer to conduct studies proving immunity?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, that's a different - a difficult situation to prove. First of all, if you just do one serology test in a low percent positive population the likelihood of a false positive result is not insignificant and should be reckoned with. And we've talked long ago on this meeting, on this call, about the potential to do not just one but a second serology, different serology test to try to, you know, firm up that exposure history. And then the question about - even about - well, you know, about immunity is obviously an important one but very difficult to prove. And in order to make claims about that in which somebody might rely on that information and - in going about their life, and potentially putting them at risk of being let's say reinfected, let's just assume they've had a prior infection but we've already had reports of reinfection. And until we firm up that understanding that's something that we're not going to be able to authorize at this time unless the data's supported.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is required to ensure compliance with IRB guidelines when conducting pure surveillance testing?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: For pure surveillance testing, researchers should follow recommendations from CMS, CDC, and FDA's guidance on its website. The FDA does not regulate this type of testing during the pandemic, and performing it under IRB guidelines is emphasized.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is required to ensure compliance with IRB guidelines when conducting pure surveillance testing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So pure surveillance, you know, you want to know what the percent positivity is in a population. That's what you're going to do. You're going to - they'll probably do this under IRB. That's not so much - first of all, pure surveillance testing according to how we define it on the FDA Web site, we have elected to not have purview over that kind of testing in this pandemic. So, you know, researchers are doing that and following our recommendations along with the recommendations of CMS and CDC.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA takes different pathways depending on whether the test has been previously cleared for Flu A/B. Less validation is needed if previously cleared; new tests require greater validation. FDA is flexible in pre-market validation for EUA.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If a developer does not have an FDA-cleared rapid influenza diagnostic test, do they need to conduct a 510(k) study to receive EUA for a combo antigen test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We are - take two different pathways depending on whether the tests have been previously cleared for say Flu A/B. And, you know, we've already reviewed it and we've already, you know, designated perhaps the unintelligible test and you're adding SARS to it. There's less development of work invalidation for such a test than if you're coming in new to us in either a combo that's new to us and that you now have SARS, Flu A/B, ADRC or whatever, and we haven't seen that test before; we haven't authorized the non-SARS analytes yet, there is a greater expectation of validation that we recommend. And that's because we haven't seen that test before. And therefore, there might be point of care studies as well as the validation of those.

QA Block 12-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can a combo antigen test developer illustrate test performance for Flu A/B and SARS versus an already approved PCR test to receive EUA?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA's antigen template does not currently provide detailed recommendations for combo or multi-analyte antigen tests. Developers can refer to the molecular template for guidance on validation paths. Two pathways exist depending on whether the non-SARS analytes have been reviewed or cleared, and the FDA expects validation work for new combinations. While flexibility exists to utilize banked samples for EUA validation, prospective data may be required post-authorization.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can a combo antigen test developer illustrate test performance for Flu A/B and SARS versus an already approved PCR test to receive EUA?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So I don't think the current antigen template, has recommendations for a combo or a multi-analyte test. Obviously we just authorized the Quidel test. Our molecular template has some good information about the recommended development path and validation for combo tests that have non-SARS respiratory viruses that we haven't reviewed before in that. And that could be a good guide but I believe the team is ready to be able to give you specific feedback on our recommendations based on our current thinking around this for direct antigen tests. So simply email that. But you can look at the molecular to start getting an idea of what we're going to be suggesting for such tests. We are - take two different pathways depending on whether the tests have been previously cleared for say Flu A/B. And, you know, we've already reviewed it and we've already, you know, designated perhaps the unintelligible test and you're adding SARS to it. There's less development of work invalidation for such a test than if you're coming in new to us in either a combo that's new to us and that you now have SARS, Flu A/B, ADRC or whatever, and we haven't seen that test before; we haven't authorized the non-SARS analytes yet, there is a greater expectation of validation that we recommend. And that's because we haven't seen that test before. And therefore, there might be point of care studies as well as the validation of those. Now in pre-market for an EUA for such a device, we're going to be flexible. We would like to see as much prospective data as possible. However, we're FDA Virtual TH not, you know, we're not in the middle of flu season yet and we may have in fact, because of mask wearing and social distancing plus the usual amount of vaccination, we may see a very light flu season going forward in the United States. That would be our hope. Hopefully that pans out. In which case, there may not be enough prospective samples in a reasonable amount - positives in a reasonable amount of time for you to follow our usual recommendation. So we are going to be very open and flexible to the use of say bank samples. Bank, Flu RC, whatever on your panel. Clearly there's plenty, unfortunately, of SARS around today. But for those other analytes we will - we absolutely will allow the use of the samples, bank samples, to pre-market, validate your test for EUA review and authorization. We would however, in all likelihood have post-market commitments and then authorizations that ask you to do a follow up prospective study that allows us to really understand the performance of those non-SARS analytes. Because that, you know, even in the pandemic that does typically require a 510k. And so we are being flexible to assimilate the development of panels such as this. And we're trying to do our best to help you make it.

However, we're FDA Virtual TH not, you know, we're not in the middle of flu season yet and we may have in fact, because of mask wearing and social distancing plus the usual amount of vaccination, we may see a very light flu season going forward in the United States. That would be our hope. Hopefully that pans out. In which case, there may not be enough prospective samples in a reasonable amount - positives in a reasonable amount of time for you to follow our usual recommendation. So we are going to be very open and flexible to the use of say bank samples. Bank, Flu RC, whatever on your panel. Clearly there's plenty, unfortunately, of SARS around today. But for those other analytes we will - we absolutely will allow the use of the samples, bank samples, to pre-market, validate your test for EUA review and authorization. We would however, in all likelihood have post-market commitments and then authorizations that ask you to do a follow up prospective study that allows us to really understand the performance of those non-SARS analytes. Because that, you know, even in the pandemic that does typically require a 510k. And so we are being flexible to assimilate the development of panels such as this.

QA Block 12-6
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the FDA have specific guidance for combo tests that combine SARS-CoV-2 and Flu A/B analytes?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA currently does not provide specific recommendations for combo antigen tests in its antigen template, but the molecular template offers guidance. FDA advises emailing their team for feedback. Validation requirements differ based on whether the test components are previously reviewed or new. The FDA is flexible with validation data, especially when certain samples are unavailable.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA have specific guidance for combo tests that combine SARS-CoV-2 and Flu A/B analytes?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So I don't think the current antigen template, has recommendations for a combo or a multi-analyte test. Obviously we just authorized the Quidel test. Our molecular template has some good information about the recommended development path and validation for combo tests that have non-SARS respiratory viruses that we haven't reviewed before in that. And that could be a good guide but I believe the team is ready to be able to give you specific feedback on our recommendations based on our current thinking around this for direct antigen tests. So simply email that. But you can look at the molecular to start getting an idea of what we're going to be suggesting for such tests. We are - take two different pathways depending on whether the tests have been previously cleared for say Flu A/B. And, you know, we've already reviewed it and we've already, you know, designated perhaps the unintelligible test and you're adding SARS to it. There's less development of work invalidation for such a test than if you're coming in new to us in either a combo that's new to us and that you now have SARS, Flu A/B, ADRC or whatever, and we haven't seen that test before; we haven't authorized the non-SARS analytes yet, there is a greater expectation of validation that we recommend. And that's because we haven't seen that test before. And therefore, there might be point of care studies as well as the validation of those. Now in pre-market for an EUA for such a device, we're going to be flexible. We would like to see as much prospective data as possible.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are there different validation requirements for combo tests that include analytes previously reviewed and authorized by the FDA versus new analytes?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: There are different validation requirements depending on whether the analytes in the combo test have been previously authorized by the FDA. Tests adding SARS to already cleared analytes like Flu A/B require less work than those involving new analytes which demand greater validation, including point-of-care studies.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are there different validation requirements for combo tests that include analytes previously reviewed and authorized by the FDA versus new analytes?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We are - take two different pathways depending on whether the tests have been previously cleared for say Flu A/B.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Will the same division of the FDA handle neutralizing antibody test submissions through a 510k as they do for EUAs?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The same division (serology, antigen, or molecular team, based on expertise) reviews both EUA and 510k submissions for COVID-19 neutralizing antibody tests.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Will the same division of the FDA handle neutralizing antibody test submissions through a 510k as they do for EUAs?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. So we have three teams. We have a serology team, we have a direct antigen team, and we have a molecular team. And they divvy up the applications by technology so that those that are most experienced in those technologies are involved in the review of those technologies. And so, you know, if - and we strongly - we'd be very open to receiving test submissions for full authorization. For the first COVID test they will be a de novo template. Once we've authorized the first de novo for a given category, all subsequent tests in that category will be obviously a 510k. That will need to adhere to the special control recommendation. That's a document that has very specific recommendations for validation of the test once we've granted a de novo and created a new regulation for a new - that new class of test. And so our staff are doing double duty. They're - the experts in our office who are reviewing EUAs are also going to be reviewing de novos and 510ks for COVID tests.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can you tell me why the FDA will not send the normal reference panel to a foreign manufacturer?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA faces challenges shipping biological materials internationally due to customs issues and shipment problems. FDA suggests contacting them directly for specific cases to explore potential solutions.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can you tell me why the FDA will not send the normal reference panel to a foreign manufacturer?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. No, a couple of things. And one of them you may want to send me an email through the templates email box. I know that we've had - I'm not aware of the specific prohibition. I know that we tried to ship internationally. But FDA Virtual TH there has been some shipment problems and - going through customs and things like that. And I have more than a little bit of experience in trying to ship biological materials from one country to another and dealing with the customs issue. And it's very challenging. So it may be due to that that they haven't been able to overcome that issue. Now it might be that we could work with a company that's in a foreign country and figure this all out and map out a shipping strategy to get it to the company in enough time so that the dry ice is still on the samples. But the other thing is that I want to examine your specific case to find out if the reference panel results are required to make an upfront decision. It is a condition of all authorizations of all tests that when we request that you do a panel test and that you do that and report the results to us. So if you send me an email with - via our templates email box ask for Doc Stenzel, on this particular issue about - well these two issues, I want to look into it a little bit more and give you a very specific response.

VERBATIM QUESTION: If a test kit is labeled as RUO, can a researcher without a CLIA certificate or a waiver purchase the kit from a manufacturer?
VERBATIM ANSWER: I am not aware of that prohibition. Now I don't know if some test developers are putting a restriction on that. If they are, I'd like to hear about it and I'd like to potentially address it through an FAQ question and answer on the FDA side.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does a test developer need an FDA-cleared rapid influenza diagnostic test to receive EUA for a combo antigen test like those from Quidel?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA does not currently have specific recommendations for combo antigen tests in the antigen template. For combo tests with previously cleared analytes, like Flu A/B, less validation work is required when adding SARS to the test. However, if the combo test and its non-SARS analytes are new to the FDA, more thorough validation will be necessary.
