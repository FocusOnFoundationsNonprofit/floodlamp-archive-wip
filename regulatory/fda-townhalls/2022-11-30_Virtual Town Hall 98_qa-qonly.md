#### 1. Monkeypox and COVID-19 Testing Updates and EUA Plans

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are FDA's long‐term plans with the monkeypox EUA?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA currently has an EUA for monkeypox diagnostics under Section 564 of the FD&C Act and cannot predict when it will be terminated. Historically, EUAs are left open for extended periods to address public health needs as seen with Zika and COVID-19. FDA will continue to ensure access to diagnostics and review EUA requests.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are FDA's long‐term plans with the monkeypox EUA?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So as we've discussed here and in the guidance document, there is currently an EUA declaration in place under Section 564 of the FD&C Act which declares that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of in vitro diagnostics for detection or diagnosis of monkeypox. We cannot anticipate when that declaration may be terminated. It's important to note that EUA declarations have historically been left open for quite a while to ensure that public health needs are addressed, and this is seen with several previous public health emergency declarations, including Zika, Ebola, and, obviously COVID‐19, which have not been terminated to date. And we at FDA are committed to help ensure that the public has access to appropriate test options for monkeypox, and we will continue to review EUA requests as needed to address public health needs.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Commander Kimberly Piermatteo (FDA)
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: Monkeypox EUA, Public Health Emergency, FDA Diagnostic Support
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is there a time frame to keep the EUA open, since cases are decreasing in the United States?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA cannot predict when the monkeypox EUA declaration will end, as EUA declarations are historically kept open to address public health needs. The EUA will remain active while public health needs persist.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is there a time frame to keep the EUA open, since cases are decreasing in the United States?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So as we've discussed here and in the guidance document, there is currently an EUA declaration in place under Section 564 of the FD&C Act which declares that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of in vitro diagnostics for detection or diagnosis of monkeypox. We cannot anticipate when that declaration may be terminated.

SPEAKER QUESTION: Commander Kimberly Piermatteo (FDA)
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: Monkeypox EUA, EUA termination timeline
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: In the instance the EUA is kept open, what would happen to the authorized tests if any potential future product is cleared?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Unless revoked, EUAs remain valid until the EUA declaration is terminated. The clearance of new products does not invalidate existing EUAs, as demonstrated with COVID-19 tests. FDA also notes a previously cleared monkeypox test and welcomes further premarket submissions.
VERBATIM QUESTION: In the instance the EUA is kept open, what would happen to the authorized tests if any potential future product is cleared?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Thanks. So as with all EUA declarations and EUAs, unless revoked, the EUAs are in effect until the EUA declaration is terminated. And those EUAs, the tests that are authorized under those EUAs, should be maintained in accordance with the conditions of authorization. Clearance of future products does not automatically mean that EUAs for other products will be revoked. As we can see with the COVID tests, we can clear a 510k without revoking EUAs for other tests. And, notably, for mpox, we already have a cleared 510k for a non‐variola orthopox virus test that detects monkeypox virus, and that test has been cleared since before the EUA declaration was made. And we also do welcome additional premarket submissions for mpox tests.

#### 2. FDA Prioritization and Updates for COVID-19 Test Development

QA Block 2-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Would a multi-analyte rapid molecular test that can detect multiple common respiratory pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, be prioritized for review?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA may prioritize EUA requests for multi-analyte rapid molecular tests and suggests developers use the pre-EUA process to discuss prioritization and validation. Priority reviews depend on public health benefits, unmet needs, and specifics of the test request. Developers should email the COVID-19 EUA mailbox with detailed information about their test.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Would a multi-analyte rapid molecular test that can detect multiple common respiratory pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, be prioritized for review?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So we may consider prioritizing EUA requests for multi‐analyte rapid molecular tests, and we encourage developers of such tests to engage with us early through a pre‐EUA to discuss prioritization as well as validation plans and approaches to consider. As is discussed in our policy for COVID‐19 tests during the public health emergency, which is the guidance document that was updated earlier this fall, we do generally intend to prioritize review of EUA requests from experienced developers for diagnostic tests that are likely to have a significant public health benefit or are likely to fulfill an unmet need. So the types of tests that are considered to meet those priorities may change as the public health needs change. And we will consider each request on its own merits to determine whether or not to prioritize review of that test. To follow up or to get questions answered on priorities, we recommend that test developers email the COVID mailbox. That's COVID19DX@fda.hhs.gov, and that's the same mailbox we've been using this whole time. We've often referred to it as the EUA mailbox or the EUA templates mailbox. It all goes to the same place. So you can email that mailbox with questions regarding whether your test meets FDA's review priorities, and when you send that email, we recommend including sufficient detail regarding your test so that we can provide informed feedback.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Commander Kimberly Piermatteo (FDA)
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)

QA Block 2-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the most effective method prior to submitting an EUA request to determine if a COVID-19 test would meet FDA's priorities for review?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends that developers use the pre-EUA process to discuss prioritization, validation plans, and test details. Developers can also email COVID19DX@fda.hhs.gov to ask if their test meets the FDA's review priorities.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the most effective method prior to submitting an EUA request to determine if a COVID-19 test would meet FDA's priorities for review?

REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 2-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is the FDA planning to provide information for healthcare providers or laboratories that order or perform antigen tests regarding how to implement the revised authorized uses for SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen tests in their testing regimens?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA issued a safety communication and updates to authorized uses recommending serial testing for all antigen tests to enhance accuracy. Instructions are included in updated test labeling, and users, including healthcare providers and labs, must follow these. Tests can be mixed and matched across manufacturers, and repeat tests can be done outside clinical settings if needed.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is the FDA planning to provide information for healthcare providers or laboratories that order or perform antigen tests regarding how to implement the revised authorized uses for SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen tests in their testing regimens?
VERBATIM ANSWER: In August of this year, FDA issued a safety communication titled At‐ Home COVID‐19 Antigen Test‐‐ Take Steps to Reduce Your Risk of False Negative, recommending increased serial testing for users of at‐home COVID‐19 antigen tests and, in fact, this is now our recommendations for all antigen tests based on available data showing the need for repeat testing after a negative result to increase the chance of an accurate test result of catching those true positive results. Then, as stated on November 1st of this year, revision of all authorized antigen tests followed the August safety communication updating the authorized uses of all antigen tests to include necessary serial testing. Both the safety communication and the revision letter include information on how to perform this serial testing. Symptomatic individuals who receive an initial negative result should test at least twice over three days with 48 hours between tests. And asymptomatic individuals who receive an initial negative test result should test at least three times over five days with 48 hours in between tests. These instructions will also be included in each test labeling as it is updated further requirements in the revision letter. It is important for all users, including healthcare providers, laboratories, home users to follow the authorized instructions for use. However, the test can be mixed and matched. So the same antigen test doesn't have to be used in all of the serial testing for a given patient. You can start out with manufacturer A and move to manufacturer B. Also, the second test does not have to be performed in a clinic. If the clinic decides that a patient can go home and do the subsequent repeat testing if the first test in the clinic is negative, that meets the spirit and letter of the safety and labeling updates.

#### 4. Transitioning from EUA to Full FDA Clearance

QA Block 4-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What level of additional documentation might need to be provided for the formal submission to allow a product or device for mpox or COVID-19 to clear in the event that an EUA expires?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: An EUA does not expire on its own; it is proactively terminated with a 180-day notice period. The FDA's draft transition guidance outlines the pathway for products moving from EUA to full market status, including enforcement policies and resources for developers.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What level of additional documentation might need to be provided for the formal submission to allow a product or device for mpox or COVID-19 to clear in the event that an EUA expires?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So the EUA doesn't actually expire. The EUA declaration has to be terminated proactively. And we have two transition guidances.

#### 5. Addressing Flu B Sample Challenges in COVID-19 Testing

QA Block 5-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: For a multi-analyte SARS-CoV-2 molecular assay, how should one address the extremely low prevalence of flu B and the lack of available clinical samples for validation and testing?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends submitting a pre-EUA to discuss options and attempting prospective collection of samples first. If that's not successful, alternative options can be discussed. FDA acknowledges the difficulty in collecting enough flu B positives and suggests submitting data similar to recent instructions for use from authorized tests like Lucira to explore paths forward.
VERBATIM QUESTION: For a multi-analyte SARS-CoV-2 molecular assay, how should one address the extremely low prevalence of flu B and the lack of available clinical samples for validation and testing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We have discussed this a bit on previous town halls, and we do recommend that you submit a pre‐EUA to discuss different options. Generally, we would expect you to attempt prospective collection and then discuss with us alternative options if that's not successful. We do recognize that the current situation with flu B will result in not being able to likely collect enough positives. Flu A though is on the rise, and I think if you look at the recent instructions for use, which include some of the performance numbers from the Lucira test that was just authorized, you'll see that, of course, there's, I think, no prospective flu B in that particular label. There is some prospective flu A. So if your data set is close to what the data is in that instructions for use, in the Lucira instructions for use, I'd say put that together for us and submit that, and we can chat with you about paths forward for your particular test.

#### 6. COVID-19 Sequencing Requirements and Omicron Prevalence Guidelines

QA Block 6-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the FDA's current thinking regarding the requirement of 30 positive sequenced COVID-19 samples collected before March 1st, and the definitions of low versus high variant prevalence?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA requires 30 omicron-sequenced samples to address performance issues seen with omicron. Sequencing is required only for samples collected before March 1, 2022. Definitions of low vs. high variant prevalence are not tracked outside the U.S., and its determination should be discussed with FDA reviewers.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the FDA's current thinking regarding the requirement of 30 positive sequenced COVID-19 samples collected before March 1st, and the definitions of low versus high variant prevalence?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah, so we did see a drop in performance with omicron, and so we are wanting to see 30 omicron samples. As far as the details of the sequencing, Kris, can you provide any more details? I mean, the sequencing is largely just to confirm that it is omicron samples that we are at. But we have a date, beyond which, if the samples are collected in the U.S., or the 30 samples, then you don't have to sequence. So it's 30 omicron but there‐‐ and I forget the exact date. Kris may remember that‐‐ but we're well past that now. Go ahead, Kris. Yeah, March 1st of last year. So if you got 30 prospective samples collected after March 1st of 2022, then we're not asking for additional sequencing data. And I think we're fairly flexible on the sequencing data that you do provide. Of course, you want it to be the final sequence to be put through the PANGO‐‐ get a PANGO lineage and show us that. But as long as you're using relatively modern sequencing techniques, I think that's something we've been accepting. Yeah, but that's only if your samples were collected partially or completely before March 1 of this year‐‐ in the U.S. So we just looked at the variants across the country and decided at what point on the calendar all the sequence data that has been submitted on COVID was above a threshold that we could just assume that the vast majority of COVID positive samples after March 1st were, in fact, omicron. Yeah, unfortunately, we don't track the variant thresholds outside of the U.S. in the same way we do in the US. And so we really can't make that blanket.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Yes, thank you. My question is how does FDA view the priority of data infrastructure for capturing and analyzing results from at‐home testing? Is that something you consider a high priority at this point?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So the FDA is encouraging that there is greater and greater connectivity so that we can track‐‐ we being healthcare providers and the healthcare system and the U.S. government can track disease more easily. For COVID at‐home tests in particular, if a connectivity or a reporting function‐‐ which doesn't have to be the device connecting. It can be an app that the consumer simply logs in and says my result was positive, my result was negative. So that is not something that we evaluate for the authorization of the test decision for any EUA for COVID, but it is something that if it's not available at launch at authorization, we do ask developers to develop that. So that is very important. And so there probably is an opportunity to help a lot of developers in this area.

Tests performing well on symptomatic patients are considered sufficient for evaluation in this context.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How should a test that performs well on symptomatic patients be evaluated in the absence of serial testing data?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So I would urge you to submit a Q‐submission or a Pre‐Submission for the same thing. Follow the guidance on this to get a formal response. But I would say, in general, that because of the NIH‐sponsored study that was done in collaboration with FDA review of the protocol and performed by the University of Massachusetts, some of the data has been published. Some of it hasn't. It has informed us on the benefits of serial testing in both symptomatic and asymptomatic. Because of that work, we want to leverage that work and not require developers to have to repeat that work. So what we're looking for‐‐ to refer to that data is that you have a test that performs well enough on symptomatic patients to qualify that.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What should developers do if the most recent COVID-19 strains are not available for testing?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA acknowledges developers may not have access to the latest COVID-19 variants due to delays in their availability in banks. Developers can use patient samples, sequence them to identify the strain, and dilute those samples for testing.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What should developers do if the most recent COVID-19 strains are not available for testing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: No, we realize that the latest variants aren't deposited in banks that can be utilized. You can always take a patient sample and sequence it to make sure what it is and dilute that down for your studies. But Kris can maybe add a little bit more flavor here, but we realize that you only can get access to some of the variants, and there's a delay before they're deposited in one of the banks, so that the very, very latest is usually not always available.

QA Block 1-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Will the clearance of a future product affect or limit the status or validity of previously authorized EUAs?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA states that clearance of new products does not automatically revoke or limit the validity of previous EUAs, as long as those authorized remain compliant with their conditions. For instance, COVID test EUAs remain valid alongside 510k-cleared tests.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Will the clearance of a future product affect or limit the status or validity of previously authorized EUAs?
VERBATIM ANSWER: As with all EUA declarations and EUAs, unless revoked, the EUAs are in effect until the EUA declaration is terminated. And those EUAs, the tests that are authorized under those EUAs, should be maintained in accordance with the conditions of authorization. Clearance of future products does not automatically mean that EUAs for other products will be revoked. As we can see with the COVID tests, we can clear a 510k without revoking EUAs for other tests. And, notably, for mpox, we already have a cleared 510k for a non‐variola orthopox virus test that detects monkeypox virus, and that test has been cleared since before the EUA declaration was made. And we also do welcome additional premarket submissions for mpox tests.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA allow flexibility in sequencing data requirements for omicron samples collected outside the U.S.?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah, March 1st of last year. So if you got 30 prospective samples collected after March 1st of 2022, then we're not asking for additional sequencing data. And I think we're fairly flexible on the sequencing data that you do provide. Of course, you want it to be the final sequence to be put through the PANGO‐‐ get a PANGO lineage and show us that.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the publication of the monkeypox antigen test template indicate FDA will reopen applications for monkeypox EUA?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So I mean, the window for monkeypox did close, and whoever had reached out and proposed a plan, we've I think we've communicated with all of those folks about whether or not we would prioritize their submissions. However, you can always submit a pre‐EUA. We just can't make any promises that it will meet our priorities because we take a look at the totality of developers that we've already given green lights to and we monitor their progress, and we're trying to meet the needs.
