#### 2. Antigen Test Sensitivity and Prevalence-Driven Performance Concerns

QA Block 2-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Would the agency comment on or express concern about recent antigen test EUA approvals where sensitivity and performance were driven by samples obtained in high-prevalence settings, such as greater than 30%, which do not reflect the national average of 8 to 10%?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA believes that the prevalence of disease in a population has minimal impact on direct antigen test performance but facilitates quicker accumulation of data for faster decision-making and test distribution.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Would the agency comment on or express concern about recent antigen test EUA approvals where sensitivity and performance were driven by samples obtained in high-prevalence settings, such as greater than 30%, which do not reflect the national average of 8 to 10%?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, no, I appreciate the question. The prevalence of disease in a population for a direct antigen test probably doesn't have an impact on Page 6 performance characteristics, that is the sensitivity or PPA or the specificity and MPA. It does, however, allow developers of tests to which we fully support to more rapidly accumulate positive and negative information so that we can make a decision that much more quickly on tests and get those tests out there. So, you know, that's at least our view, but, you know, if you have specific concerns about that, I'd love to hear them.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Greg Ping
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: antigen test EUA approvals, test sensitivity and prevalence, FDA data evaluation
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 2-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How does the FDA view the impact of disease prevalence on test performance characteristics such as sensitivity and specificity for COVID-19 diagnostic tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA believes that disease prevalence does not significantly impact the sensitivity or specificity of direct antigen tests. However, higher prevalence enables quicker data collection, facilitating faster decision-making for test approvals.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How does the FDA view the impact of disease prevalence on test performance characteristics such as sensitivity and specificity for COVID-19 diagnostic tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, no, I appreciate the question.

REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 2-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Why does the FDA require data about patient symptom onset to evaluate test performance?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA evaluates patient symptom onset data because it provides insights into the course of infection and expected detection rates over time. This helps assess test performance, especially as some tests show reduced performance beyond a certain number of days after symptom onset. Confirmatory molecular testing is also needed for accurate comparisons.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Why does the FDA require data about patient symptom onset to evaluate test performance?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So, yes. So when it's easiest for us to make a determination on how good a test is, if we get data per patient, you know, how many days since they began having any symptoms. We don't necessarily prescribe on what those symptoms are. But, you know, symptom onset for those who are symptomatic is a good indication of the course of the viral infection, and gives us a clear indication of, you know, sort of what we kind of expect the detection rate to be in those patients by day after the beginning of symptoms. So some of the direct antigen tests have either presented data only in the first five days or seven days or have had a decrease in performance potentially after five days. So -- and then we want, you know, a good molecular confirmation that those patients, you know, have SARS so that we have a, you know, a good comparator upon which to base whether a patient is either positive or should be positive or negative for the virus. Hopefully that helps.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: evaluation of test performance, symptom onset data, diagnostic criteria
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 2-5
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is there a specific timeframe after symptom onset when antigen test performance is most critical for FDA evaluation?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA evaluates antigen test performance by reviewing data on days since symptom onset. Symptom onset offers insight into the viral infection timeline, with reliable data typically within the first five to seven days. Performance may decline after five days, and molecular confirmation of SARS presence is essential for accuracy.
VERBATIM QUESTION: IMPLICIT
VERBATIM ANSWER: So, yes. So when it's easiest for us to make a determination on how good a test is, if we get data per patient, you know, how many days since they began having any symptoms. We don't necessarily prescribe on what those symptoms are. But, you know, symptom onset for those who are symptomatic is a good indication of the course of the viral infection, and gives us a clear indication of, you know, sort of what we kind of expect the detection rate to be in those patients by day after the beginning of symptoms. Page 7 So some of the direct antigen tests have either presented data only in the first five days or seven days or have had a decrease in performance potentially after five days. So -- and then we want, you know, a good molecular confirmation that those patients, you know, have SARS so that we have a, you know, a good comparator upon which to base whether a patient is either positive or should be positive or negative for the virus. Hopefully that helps.

TOPICS: Antigen test performance, Symptom onset timing, FDA evaluation criteria
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 2-6
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the FDA recommend using molecular confirmation to validate antigen test results during the evaluation process?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA prefers molecular confirmation to validate and compare results for antigen tests, ensuring accurate determination of patient positivity or negativity for the virus.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA recommend using molecular confirmation to validate antigen test results during the evaluation process?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So -- and then we want, you know, a good molecular confirmation that those patients, you know, have SARS so that we have a, you know, a good comparator upon which to base whether a patient is either positive or should be positive or negative for the virus.

TOPICS: Molecular confirmation, Antigen tests, Test result validation
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 2-7
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What criteria does the FDA look for in determining whether a patient is positive or negative based on test results and comparator data?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA assesses whether a test is effective by examining data on patients' symptom onset, the detection rate by days after symptoms start, and molecular confirmation of SARS to validate positivity or negativity.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What criteria does the FDA look for in determining whether a patient is positive or negative based on test results and comparator data?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So, yes. So when it's easiest for us to make a determination on how good a test is, if we get data per patient, you know, how many days since they began having any symptoms. We don't necessarily prescribe on what those symptoms are.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: If Spanish speakers choose to use the English IFU while using the product and are assessed on the understandability of the Spanish IFU after using the product, is that acceptable?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA supports inclusion of Spanish IFU instructions but does not require them. English IFU instructions are required and must be assessed.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If Spanish speakers choose to use the English IFU while using the product and are assessed on the understandability of the Spanish IFU after using the product, is that acceptable?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So, you know, inclusion of Spanish IFU instructions is something that we support. I don't believe it's a requirement. Toby maybe you can confirm. But English is a requirement and we definitely want to assess, you know, the English language version of the instructions. So, that would be important to have, you know, as some of the users perhaps English only speakers will be in the human factor so that we are assessing the English language version of the instructions.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Where can I find information on authorized saliva-based diagnostic tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA has not authorized saliva-based diagnostic antigen tests but is open to considering them if developers present suitable performance data.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Where can I find information on authorized saliva-based diagnostic tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: And that would be, no, we haven't. Though we're open to it and discussions with various developers of direct antigen tests they haven't necessarily taken us up on that. And there may be good reason. I personally have not seen performance data of a direct antigen test on saliva as compared to traditional, you know, swab sample from the nasal passages of some sort for a molecular competitor.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA has not authorized saliva-based direct antigen tests but is open to reviewing them if performance data supports their effectiveness. Home testing options based on nasal swabs have proven successful and are authorized.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are there plans or considerations for saliva-based direct antigen home tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: And that would be, no, we haven't. Though we're open to it and discussions with various developers of direct antigen tests they haven't necessarily taken us up on that. And there may be good reason. I personally have not seen performance data of a direct antigen test on saliva as compared to traditional, you know, swab sample from the nasal passages of some sort for a molecular competitor. But if the performance is good, can be demonstrated we're open to that sample time. Yes. Well, you know, if a test platform is whether direct antigen or molecular is amenable to a swab type sample either direct swab or swab into a media before it goes on to the test. We already know that because of the home collection authorizations we've made for swabs that self collection in the home, unobserved, with the nasal swab works very well. So that is an option, be at swabs can be in short supply as well as media, obviously.

#### 6. Serial Testing Protocols for Accurate Virus Detection

QA Block 6-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can you explain more about the serial testing protocols you discussed earlier?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA has discussed serial testing protocols involving daily or sequential testing at home, aimed at detecting COVID-19 in asymptomatic carriers and symptomatic individuals. If a single test lacks sufficient sensitivity for authorization, combining results from tests on consecutive days (e.g., day one and day two) could meet performance standards for approval. Direct antigen tests during the first five days of symptoms demonstrate strong performance, and the FDA is open to similar innovative approaches.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can you explain more about the serial testing protocols you discussed earlier?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. So if a particular test, there's been some discussion around say, you know, something that can be done daily with consumers or patients in the home to assess whether or not they're positive for the virus, obviously, probably more looking at asymptomatic carriers. But also people who are symptomatic and want to know, you know, I just talked to somebody who, you know, and they just have a common cold. Now we're getting into the cold and flu season. And symptoms don't necessarily, you know, don't tell you whether it's SARS or not especially if you're not, you know a patient is very, very sick. And so we've had open dialogue with a number of groups around, you know, what the sensitivity of a single test result should be. And you know, if the sensitivity of a single test result is not say high enough for us to be able to be comfortable making the authorization for that test. It may be that if you test days one and two or days one and three. So you might provide the consumer or patient with two self tests. And it's the combined results that matters not so much a single results. So if either one of them is positive, then that may improve performance of maybe a very widely available test, just to where we're comfortable. And really, what we would like to see is that, you know, is that if a single -- you know, we all the direct antigen test that we've authorized so far, especially during the core period of symptoms, which correlates really, into a relatively high viral load. In the first five days, they all perform well above our recommended level for authorization. And so we're pleased to see that but we're open to other tests that may benefit from doing it in say twos. You know, do it day one, day two. Do it day one, day three, and if the performance overall, you know, is sufficient to justify authorization we're open to that. So hopefully that clears up that sort of serial testing option.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Jessica Russell
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: serial testing, sensitivity of tests, test authorization
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 6-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the sensitivity thresholds the FDA considers acceptable for a single test result?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA considers single-test sensitivity levels during core symptoms to meet or exceed recommended authorization levels, largely due to high viral loads. If a single test is insufficiently sensitive, serial testing (e.g., over two or three days) may improve performance for authorization.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the sensitivity thresholds the FDA considers acceptable for a single test result?
VERBATIM ANSWER: And so we've had open dialogue with a number of groups around, you know, what the sensitivity of a single test result should be.

TOPICS: test sensitivity, serial testing, FDA authorization criteria
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 6-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How does the FDA evaluate the combined performance of tests conducted on multiple days for authorization purposes?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA evaluates combined test performance by reviewing results from testing on multiple days, such as day one and day two or day one and day three. If the combined results improve performance to a level sufficient for authorization, the FDA is open to authorizing such tests, especially for consumers or asymptomatic carriers.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How does the FDA evaluate the combined performance of tests conducted on multiple days for authorization purposes?

#### 7. Guidance on Using Alternate Transport Media in Testing

QA Block 7-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What additional validation is required or what advice can you provide for incorporating a new transport media into a lab, considering the media is stable for up to 21 days and listed in an EUA that aligns with the current Thermo Fisher protocol?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends performing standard CLIA verification when changing transport media. Specific test and media details should be sent to the FDA mailbox for further guidance. Refer to FDA FAQs for information on alternate media.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What additional validation is required or what advice can you provide for incorporating a new transport media into a lab, considering the media is stable for up to 21 days and listed in an EUA that aligns with the current Thermo Fisher protocol?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. So generally, you would want to do, you know, the normal verification that you would do under CLIA to change the media that you're using. It depends a little bit on exactly what test you're running and exactly what the other media is that you're using. So it might be best to send in the specific details to the mailbox so that we can take a look but typically, you know, we do have some information on our FAQ about alternate media that can be used and, you know, has been validated and so that that technically is not something that would be a problem.

#### 10. Impact of CDC Guideline Changes on Testing Templates

QA Block 10-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Will the recent CDC guideline change, stating asymptomatic patients exposed to SARS-CoV-2 do not necessarily require testing, have any expected impact on FDA templates, especially for direct antigen tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA does not anticipate changes to templates due to the CDC guideline change. Existing EUA-authorized tests can still be used on asymptomatic patients if prescribed, and developers can promote their tests for such populations, following FDA guidance. Alternatives to prove test performance for asymptomatic use are also accepted.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Will the recent CDC guideline change, stating asymptomatic patients exposed to SARS-CoV-2 do not necessarily require testing, have any expected impact on FDA templates, especially for direct antigen tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So, no and any questions about the CDC guidance I would direct to them. But we continue to support that those tests who have received the EUA authorization or have gone down the notified pathway, whether a direct antigen or molecular test, if there's a clinical order, a prescription for that test, and it happened to be on an asymptomatic patient than more supportive of the lab performing the test and reporting out the results for that individual. If a test developer wishes to specifically have a claim for detection of virus and an asymptomatic, individual or population, then you know, if they want to go and promote their test for that, then we're very willing to work with the test developer according to the, you know, we urge you to follow the template recommendations, but we're open to alternatives in order to show that the test works well in the asymptomatic population. So it has to do with what the developer wants to promote their test for if it's, you know, the standard promotion, and they can do that without testing in the symptomatic population and clinicians and place an order for that test. And we've not heard pushback from labs. You know, of doing, performing the testing on that in the high complexity labs, at least. So, and we've addressed some of the other concerns that other labs have had regarding CLIA-waived testing, and we believe those have all been addressed. So hopefully that answers your question.

#### 14. Saliva Testing vs NP Swabs: Sensitivity and Validation Challenges

QA Block 14-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the FDA have more data on viral shedding kinetics in saliva compared to nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is still gathering data on viral shedding in saliva compared to NP swabs. NP swabs are the gold standard, and saliva has shown variable performance, making it challenging to authorize without more data.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA have more data on viral shedding kinetics in saliva compared to nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, that's a great question. Unfortunately, our knowledge about viral shedding into the saliva oral fluid is still being developed. traditionally with a respiratory virus NP swabs have been sort of the gold standard for collection. But for a variety of reasons and this pandemic, you know, saliva has taken on an interesting and important role. We have seen quite variable performance with saliva. And in some cases, we're not able to authorize it or requiring more data in order to support an authorization. We're not sure. We're still gathering information about that. However, in a normal distribution of results with an NP swab or a mid- turbinate swab. In normal distribution, I would talk about, you know, there's a good variety and the normal sort of variety of the levels of positivity in the midturbinate swab or the NP swab, including, you know, we would say about 25 percent for a molecular test for saliva, that seek EUA authorization for saliva, that about 25 percent of those should be low positive. We generally describe low positives as CTs that are over 30, but it does depend on the comparative molecular testing you're using. And we've found that assessment allows us to assess whether that particular saliva collection method and the associated test that goes with that, and we can assess the quality of that test and make a determination.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is it better to use the cycle threshold (CT) cutoff or the limit of detection (LOD) for determining test performance, and should percentages of samples at one or two times the LOD be considered?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA considers the gap between LOD and CT cutoff during evaluations, accounting for data range and test sensitivity. The FDA reference panel is used to assess relative test sensitivities, particularly for tests with LODs near 30 cycles.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is it better to use the cycle threshold (CT) cutoff or the limit of detection (LOD) for determining test performance, and should percentages of samples at one or two times the LOD be considered?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, I know there definitely is usually a gap between LOD and the cutoff. And we do take that into consideration when we look at the data and the range of data. Many molecular LODs are well above 30 cycles, you know, you mentioned 30, mid 30s. And so we do take that into account.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: How does the FDA determine that the CDC test is the negative test as accurate and treat a more sensitive test as producing false positives?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA requires the comparator test to be EUA-authorized and ideally without limitations. Developers may choose between comparators, and the FDA is working on providing sensitivity data to aid in this choice. If a test is more sensitive than the comparator, showing proof may involve incorporating a third test or additional annotations in the instructions, ensuring a fair assessment.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How does the FDA determine that the CDC test is the negative test as accurate and treat a more sensitive test as producing false positives?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, so you do bring up an important point, and then, you know, one that I've experienced prior to, in my development work prior to joining the FDA. So if you a more sensitive assay then the comparator asked you that you're using. How do you, you know, you make sure that you have false positives when you really don't, it's just that your assay is more sensitive. So, you know, we do require that the comparator be EUA authorized now and then that can be, you know, it's best if there's no limitations on that assay, you don't want to pick an assay that that has low sensitivity and maybe has a presumed negative, you know, instructions for use right now because of potential low sensitivity. But if there are no limitations, some of the limitations on the EUA authorize molecular test is a comparator, then, you know, you have the option of picking the comparator. And there are definitely a range of assays. And we are working hard to start posting some of the LOD relative LOD information on assays for those developers who have received the FDA panel and tested. So we think this is going to give developers and everyone in the testing community at least, you know, a better idea of what are the relative sensitivities of these essays? Short of that, I mean, whatever comparator you have, we do -- there are options for how you can determine proof in that case. So you can you know, with FDA concurrency, you can have your plan, you can do a third test that might be more sensitive than the original comparator. And we can, at the very least, annotate the tables in the instructions for use with that information showing that say, you know, another comparator that's more sensitive than the first comparator was also positive, just like what your essay ones, or if it was negative, and that information goes in the instructions for use as well. And then there are ways to use multiple tests to establish truth usually that in both testing most of the samples with two tests. So, but there are different ways to achieve it when there are relative different sensitivities and it's our effort to help those tests that might be more sensitive than the comparator they're using.

#### 16. Evaluating Serial At-Home Antigen Test Sensitivity and Performance

QA Block 16-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What data are you looking for in a submission for serial at-home direct antigen tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends consulting its non-lab diagnostic template for study requirements, including positives and negatives. For OTC tests, data on asymptomatic populations is needed due to varied use and results interpretation challenges at home. Serial testing involves combining results of two tests on different days to enhance detection sensitivity and specificity.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What data are you looking for in a submission for serial at-home direct antigen tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So if we -- if you go to our non-lab diagnostic template is posted, it does go through the recommended positives and negatives for the study. If it is a by prescription test, you don't need to test any asymptomatic individuals. If it is an OTC, over the counter, non-prescription tests, then we do want to know the performance in the asymptomatic population because I know when you sell it to a consumer in the home, you don't know you know how it's going to be used, whether it's going to be in symptomatic people or asymptomatic. And they also on -- if it's not prescription, then they don't have somebody, they don't have a health care provider, helping them interpret the results. And so when we talk about serial testing, think of say, like, it may be that it's a two pack. So two test in a package for one individual would, you know, be run on that individual, it just would be run on different days in order to try to increase the sensitivity for detection in that patient. If a single test result with that device falls below our recommended levels, for example. So maybe, for example, you have a 70 percent single test result, but if you do two tests for the same patient, but it's on two different days and suddenly you pick up another 10 percent of positives, then you have that recommended 80 percent sensitivity. Likewise, the specificity or MPA gets also tested twice. So you think of a device not as -- in this case not as a single test, but it's two tests together. Together, what is the sensitivity and together what is the specificity?

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Should the cohort size for the real-world asymptomatic population be larger than 30?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA requires performance data on the asymptomatic population for OTC tests but does not specify if the cohort size must be larger than 30.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Should the cohort size for the real-world asymptomatic population be larger than 30?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So if we -- if you go to our non-lab diagnostic template is posted, it does go through the recommended positives and negatives for the study. If it is a by prescription test, you don't need to test any asymptomatic individuals. If it is an OTC, over the counter, non-prescription tests, then we do want to know the performance in the asymptomatic population because I know when you sell it to a consumer in the home, you don't know you know how it's going to be used, whether it's going to be in symptomatic people or asymptomatic.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What information can you provide about the performance of individual tests that are conducted serially?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Serial testing improves sensitivity by testing the same individual on different days. For example, a single test with 70% sensitivity may meet the FDA's 80% target when two tests conducted serially detect more positives.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What information can you provide about the performance of individual tests that are conducted serially?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So if we -- if you go to our non-lab diagnostic template is posted, it does go through the recommended positives and negatives for the study.

And they also on -- if it's not prescription, then they don't have somebody, they don't have a health care provider, helping them interpret the results. And so when we talk about serial testing, think of say, like, it may be that it's a two pack. So two test in a package for one individual would, you know, be run on that individual, it just would be run on different days in order to try to increase the sensitivity for detection in that patient. Page 40 If a single test result with that device falls below our recommended levels, for example. So maybe, for example, you have a 70 percent single test result, but if you do two tests for the same patient, but it's on two different days and suddenly you pick up another 10 percent of positives, then you have that recommended 80 percent sensitivity. Likewise, the specificity or MPA gets also tested twice. So you think of a device not as -- in this case not as a single test, but it's two tests together. Together, what is the sensitivity and together what is the specificity?

QA Block 16-6
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How should serial tests be designed and evaluated to improve sensitivity in detecting positive cases?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends evaluating serial tests as a combined package where two tests are performed on different days. This can improve sensitivity, for example, from 70% for a single test to 80% with two tests. For OTC tests, performance in asymptomatic populations is important to account for diverse usage scenarios.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How should serial tests be designed and evaluated to improve sensitivity in detecting positive cases?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So if we -- if you go to our non-lab diagnostic template is posted, it does go through the recommended positives and negatives for the study.

QA Block 16-7
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the acceptable approach for combining sensitivity and specificity results from serial tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends combining serial test results by considering the sensitivity and specificity of two tests conducted for the same individual on different days. For example, when a single test shows 70% sensitivity, performing a second test can improve detection by capturing an additional percentage of positives, achieving recommended sensitivity levels. Both sensitivity and specificity must be evaluated cumulatively for the two tests together.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the acceptable approach for combining sensitivity and specificity results from serial tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So if we -- if you go to our non-lab diagnostic template is posted, it does go through the recommended positives and negatives for the study.

#### 17. Validation Requirements for Expanding Molecular EUA Sample Types

QA Block 17-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What types of additional testing would the FDA require to expand an existing EUA for testing NPS swabs in sterile saline or sterile PBS?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends validating the new sample type using contrived samples with either live or inactivated virus, typically near LOD (limit of detection). The validation should include spiking a negative NP swab in saline or PBS with near LOD concentrations and testing 30 samples. Submit this validation as a EUA amendment, after which the change can be implemented during review.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What types of additional testing would the FDA require to expand an existing EUA for testing NPS swabs in sterile saline or sterile PBS?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. So that is not a particularly challenging sample type. In order to include it in your label in your instructions for use in your labeling, yes we'd want you to validate that. That can be done usually with contrived samples using either live or inactivated virus is what our recommendations would be. You can still I believe get inactivated virus from the AI either radiated or inactivated. And we'd like to see typically near LOD work on mock samples. So you would spike in the normal patient matrix if its a nasal pharyngeal swab, taking a negative NP swab you would put it into your saline and/or your PBS and then you would spike that with take negative NP and we spiked that with near LOD, you know, around two x but I would check with our reviewers, LOD. And I think they typically asked for 30 different samples. You can do that validation, you can send the validation to us as a EUA amendment. And then we're allowing you to go ahead and launch that change. Once you've submitted that amendment to us while we review that, if we have any questions, we'll reach out to you but we don't want to hold up, expanding your labeling and that way once you've completed the validation and submitted that validation needed to us.
