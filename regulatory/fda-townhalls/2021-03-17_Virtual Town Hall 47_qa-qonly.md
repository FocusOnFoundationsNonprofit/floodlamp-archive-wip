#### 1. FDA Updates on SARS-CoV-2 Test Development and Screening Policies

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the updates included in the new serology template regarding viral mutations and variants?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The updated serology template includes information on viral mutations and variants, along with clarifying edits throughout.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the updates included in the new serology template regarding viral mutations and variants?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Just this morning the updated templates on our Web site, we updated the serology template for test developers. And in that update we added some information about viral mutations and variants, and also did some clarifying edits throughout.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: serology template, viral mutations, variants
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How should developers handle low positive sample requirements for validation?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Developers can use banked frozen samples combined with fresh samples, but at least 10%-20% of positives should involve low positive samples reflecting natural viral load distributions. Additionally, a minimum of five fresh positive samples is required pre-market for validation.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How should developers handle low positive sample requirements for validation?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, we are allowing banked frozen samples to be used and banked samples can be mixed in with fresh samples. We still are asking that at least 10% to 20% of the positives are composed of low positive samples which reflect the natural distribution of SARS-CoV-2 viral loads. We have seen that even early in symptomatic disease that CTs can be relatively high. Per the antigen template, you know, we do want to see these low positives, at least 10%. You know, and then we do want to see fresh sample as well, a minimum of five positive samples pre-market. And this is because we have noted multiple times now, both for molecular and for antigen, that freezing can actually for still specifically undetermined reasons, allows a greater sensitivity. And so pre-frost studies can show that the performance is same or different. But just to be safe we do want to see a minimum of five fresh samples pre- market, positive samples. And then we would ask you to fulfill that on the rest of the samples being fresh after authorization.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Validation requirements, Low positive samples, SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 1-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Why does the FDA require a minimum of five fresh positive samples pre-market for molecular and antigen tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA requires a minimum of five fresh positive samples pre-market for molecular and antigen tests because freezing can increase sensitivity for reasons not fully understood. To ensure reliable validation, fresh samples are needed both pre-market and post-authorization.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Why does the FDA require a minimum of five fresh positive samples pre-market for molecular and antigen tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: And yes, we are allowing banked frozen samples to be used and banked samples can be mixed in with fresh samples.

QA Block 1-5
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the implications of the new template on serial screening for point-of-care and at-home tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The new template aims to streamline the EUA process for serial screening tests, including point-of-care and at-home tests, by enabling test developers to seek authorization using strong performance data with symptomatic patients and conducting post-market studies to validate asymptomatic performance. This approach mitigates false results risks.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the implications of the new template on serial screening for point-of-care and at-home tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yesterday we issued a new policy, serial screening and particularly screening asymptomatic individuals which we view as a critical part of reducing the spread of COVID-19. You know, screening involves testing asymptomatic individuals who do not have known or suspected exposure to COVID-19 in order to make individual patient decisions such as whether an individual participates in an activity based on the test results. Yesterday we also issued a fact sheet to assist schools, workplaces, communities and others, looking to establish blood testing programs to screen asymptomatic individuals as they are selecting a test for screening. We also posted a new template for molecular and antigen tests for serial screening. We expect that the recommendations and information we provided here for test developers, will help streamline the path to an EUA authorization for screening tests, specifically the template outlines, outline situations in which FDA may authorize certain tests for screening, with serial testing prior to conducting - prior to the developers conducting certain performance evaluations with asymptomatic individuals. This may include, in certain circumstances, authorizing a point of care and at home tests for OTC, nonprescription use, if all the appropriate studies have been other studies for usability and user studies and user comprehension have been outperformed. In this situation we are leveraging evidence of a test strong performance in symptomatic patients. Combined with serial testing it mitigates the risk of false results when testing asymptomatic individuals for the cases in which we have not reviewed the asymptomatic testing performance pre-market. And we expect to see that in the post market studies showing and demonstrating adequate performance in the post-market setting would demonstrate that adequate performance with the serial testing plan.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE

QA Block 1-8
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can existing OTC test developers use a supplemental application to gain authorization for serial screening claims?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Existing OTC test developers can use a supplemental amendment application to request authorization for serial screening claims.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can existing OTC test developers use a supplemental application to gain authorization for serial screening claims?
VERBATIM ANSWER: For a developer who's already submitting that information, they would not need to submit more for FDA to authorize their test for OTC though. They can simply come in with a supplemented amendment application asking to convert to OTC based on the serial testing program.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE

VERBATIM QUESTION: What constitutes compliance with labeling requirements for OTC, prescription, and screening tests under the new policy?
VERBATIM ANSWER: In order for a test to be authorized for OTC or nonprescription use, such tests need to be - needs to have previously shown asymptomatic screening data. But with this, since - in order to be an OTC test. But now we are allowing that data for asymptomatic performance using screening, to be revealed to us after authorization. This template provides an option for screening authorization prior to collecting data or submitting - completing the validation for asymptomatic individuals. We would still expect validation symptomatic individuals as well as usability, user comprehension and layperson appropriate labeling for an OTC test.

QA Block 1-11
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Could tests previously authorized solely for symptomatic use transition to include a screening indication under the new policies?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Tests authorized for symptomatic use can transition to a screening indication under new FDA policies, unless labeling specifies they are only for symptomatic individuals.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Could tests previously authorized solely for symptomatic use transition to include a screening indication under the new policies?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Tests authorized for a symptomatic claim can be ordered by a provider for screening purposes....It is important however to be aware that certain tests include labeling and state the tests should only be used for symptomatic individuals. These tests should not be used for screening and this pathway would not be open to them. However, we do know that some groups are setting up testing programs for back to school, back to work, and prefer to use a test that is authorized for screening.

QA Block 1-13
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How does the new FDA template address CLIA certification requirements for at-home vs. point-of-care use?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA's new template does not alter CLIA certification requirements, as these are overseen by CMS. At-home self-testing is not subject to CLIA requirements, while point-of-care tests require appropriate CLIA certifications. The new template provides a streamlined process for test developers to seek serial screening claims, potentially allowing asymptomatic screening data to be submitted post-authorization for OTC test approval.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How does the new FDA template address CLIA certification requirements for at-home vs. point-of-care use?
VERBATIM ANSWER: CLIA requirements are overseen by CMS and FDA's actions in this policy are not removing any CLIA requirements for the use of at home tests for self-testing in the - is not subject to CLIA requirements. This new template is also not automatically changing any authorizations. It is providing a streamlined path for test developers seeking serial screening claims. So in order for a test to be authorized for OTC or nonprescription use, such tests need to be - needs to have previously shown asymptomatic screening data. But with this, since - in order to be an OTC test. But now we are allowing that data for asymptomatic performance using screening, to be revealed to us after authorization.

#### 3. Screening Claims for EUA Antigen Tests and Post-Market Requirements

QA Block 3-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: For an EUA antigen test in symptomatic individuals with a PPA above 80%, does the new template released yesterday allow authorization for both a symptomatic claim and a screening claim for asymptomatic individuals?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Yes, for an EUA antigen test with at least 80% PPA (70% or greater lower bound), the FDA allows a symptomatic claim and a screening claim for asymptomatic individuals if serial testing is conducted. Existing templates for one-time asymptomatic use are also an option. Post-market studies are required to confirm performance in asymptomatic individuals.
VERBATIM QUESTION: For an EUA antigen test in symptomatic individuals with a PPA above 80%, does the new template released yesterday allow authorization for both a symptomatic claim and a screening claim for asymptomatic individuals?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. We're anticipating that the serial testing will bring performance in an - unknown performance in asymptomatic population up to an acceptable level. We will want to measure that for each device that - a test that's authorized in a post market study, to confirm the performance in the asymptomatic population reaches that 80% or more, utilizing serial testing. So yes, a test authorized for - currently authorized for at least 80% sensitivity PPA or above, with the lower bound being 70% or greater, can seek this immediate change to a screening claim at the point of care test. And they've done all of the point of care studies and maybe already authorized, they can add a screening claim upon request by agreeing to do this serial testing program and doing the post market study. Now the existing templates for one time use OTC and asymptomatic screening, still are in existence. So if developers want to still use that pathway and get a one time use claim that's fine as well. But for the lower sensitivity, without data in the asymptomatic population we want that serial testing as part of the authorization and we want to confirm performance in a post market study. Hopefully I addressed all of your questions. There were a few there.

#### 4. Validation Requirements for Home Dried Blood Spot Testing

QA Block 4-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: If we are a lab running an EUA authorized serology test, authorized on venipuncture blood, and want to use a dried blood spot for testing, does this require a full validation or just a comparison study with the existing sample method?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA considers at-home dried blood spot collection a device situation, not an LDT. There is an FDA template for validating at-home collections. Within a healthcare environment, labs can validate a dried blood spot as an additional sample method without submitting an EUA, but it will no longer be an EUA-authorized test.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If we are a lab running an EUA authorized serology test, authorized on venipuncture blood, and want to use a dried blood spot for testing, does this require a full validation or just a comparison study with the existing sample method?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. So for at home collection that is not considered an LDT situation but a device situation. And we have posted a template already with recommendations for validating a home dried blood spot collection. So I'd refer you to that on our FDA Web site. If you are validating that as an additional sample type for - in your lab for a kit that you're using that's authorized, you can do that within the confines of your healthcare system in healthcare environments and it doesn't require an EUA submission.

#### 5. Defining Screening vs. Surveillance in Swab Pool Testing

QA Block 5-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: If you collect a 10 swab pool with a single swab from each person but place it in the same transport tube for media, with the assumption that you will re-collect the specimens from each of those 10 people for individualized testing if the pool is positive, is that initial pool testing considered screening or surveillance?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The classification of the 10-swab pooled testing depends on specific details, intent, and adherence to FDA, CDC, and CMS guidelines. If results are used to inform individual actions, it is generally considered screening. Potential issues like sensitivity loss or viral load thresholds must also be addressed.
VERBATIM QUESTION: if you collect a 10 swab pool with a single swab from each person but you place it in the same transport tube for media, with the assumption that you will re-collect the specimens from each one of those 10 people for individualized testing if that pool is positive, is that initial pool testing considered screening or surveillance?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. I mean that is an on the edge question between surveillance and screening and I'd recommend that you come in with a question into the Template email address with that question. Typically, when I've talked to people who are doing diagnostic or screening, looking at screening, they will collect two swabs at the time of collection and will retain the second swab in order to deconvolute that. Typically, diagnostic or screening testing provides results directly to an individual. If something's done purely for surveillance purposes following all the FAQs and guidances that are provided by the FDA and CMS and CDC, then that sort of combined pool could be used in that kind of program. So it depends. It depends on the details; it depends on following those various FAQs and guidances on how to do screening testing or diagnostic testing and/or surveillance testing. Do, you know, whether you do purely surveillance or not - well, if you do purely surveillance do also look at our template on how to validate this type of swab pooling because it has different considerations than pooling media. In particular, with pooling media you're more concerned about losing sensitivity dissolution. When you're pooling swabs the concern has to do with do you concentrate any inhibition in that swab pooling, or do you push the overall viral load in that sample of a threshold that is no longer detectable by that particular assay? So we've definitely seen - we've projected it could be seen and then we've now definitely seen that if you load up a pool maybe, you know, with swabs, with a too high a viral load that you can get a false negative on that pool and that would be unfortunate. So I'm sorry I can't be a little bit more definitive but it does depend. I'm happy to converse through the templates email box.

#### 7. Serology Testing Guidance and Prioritization in Pandemic Response

QA Block 7-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is there any screening test for serology that the FDA is contemplating?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is open to considering serology tests for uses such as donor screening for convalescent plasma or measuring immune responses, but these tests need to demonstrate good science and data for specific use cases. High-throughput tests remain a priority, while low-throughput and non-home tests are not prioritized. The FDA emphasizes selecting appropriate tests relative to specific vaccine responses.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is there any screening test for serology that the FDA is contemplating?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So when you're talking about a serology test in screening its use could be considered for screening for a donor selection for a convalescent plasma donation. It could also be screening for people for measurements say of an immune response that may imply with data supporting it. You know, and some sort of immunity or neutralizing antibody. And, you know, it's made some developers talk to us about, you know, can they use their serology test to inform whether somebody has responded adequately in their adaptive immune response to a vaccine? I want to alert this audience that we have started hearing reports that some are using - some clinicians are ordering a serology test after vaccination. And some of those test results are coming back negative unexpectedly and there is some concern. And when those investigations have been done it turns out that that vaccine generates an antibody to a spike protein but the serology test is directed towards the endpoint. So that serology test obviously is not going to be the ideal candidate to - for a clinician to order off label a test to take a look at response to vaccine. We remain open as has been expressed before multiple times, to additional claims around serology tests. I think what I would say is we want to make sure and expand upon what I've just said about selecting the appropriate serology test to look for immune response from a vaccine. And so we'll be looking at various pathways to do that and make sure that that's clear to laboratories and ordering clinicians. So yes, again we're open to these sorts of things. We make decisions based on good science and data for a particular serology test and a particular indication. And as I've just said, it may come down to the specific vaccine as well, whether a serology test functions for that specific vaccine. We also have stated that very high throughput tests of all categories, are a priority. But low throughput, non-point of care, non-home tests are currently and not - we don't envision making those a priority.

We also have stated that very high throughput tests of all categories, are a priority. But low throughput, non-point of care, non-home tests are currently and not - we don't envision making those a priority. We are looking to expand as fast as possible on the available testing for COVID-19, you know, from where it is now several fold higher per day. And that's - and also expanding access, so that's going to be achieved with the higher throughput central lab test as well as access to point of care testing and home testing and home collection. So those categories still remain a high priority.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are there specific FDA recommendations on how developers can facilitate users reporting results to their healthcare providers?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends that developers encourage users of over-the-counter tests to report their results to healthcare providers but does not legally require it.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are there specific FDA recommendations on how developers can facilitate users reporting results to their healthcare providers?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. So if it's an over the counter test and it's performed at home, outside of the laboratory, there is no legal, federal legal requirement to report the results of that test. We are encouraging developers to provide an option for OTC users to report their results if they so choose. They cannot be compelled. We, in our authorization, do recommend that patients report their results to their healthcare provider so that their healthcare provider is aware of that and potentially can help them out. So there is no requirement for, pre-authorization requirement for a test to have a reporting feature for any type of test, let alone a home test. So I hope that clarifies that.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the software requirements that need to be met for a medical device that triages individuals for testing?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Software used to triage individuals for testing is considered a medical device and will be reviewed alongside the testing program. Developers should consider FDA's software requirements and be prepared to submit a pre-EUA for review, focusing on benefit/risk analysis of their system.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the software requirements that need to be met for a medical device that triages individuals for testing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So home tests are a priority. So you're talking about a piece of software that would be developed that would determine who gets tested in which form or way. And we are currently considering that a software as a medical device. And so the software would be reviewed as well as the testing program. And so you should look at some of the software requirements for such determination. And we will be looking particularly at the benefit/risk of that kind. In particular, we don't necessarily mind that more people get reflected to a more sensitive test, but the risk is higher if you're eliminating people with your software, who might actually be positive for SARS. And so that is a little bit riskier calculation. So if you want to come in with a pre-EUA for that sort of triaging software idea or whatever information you have on that, and ask us what we think we can authorize around that, we would be open to it.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Would the use of serial testing reduce the perceived risk of relying on software to triage individuals for further testing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Oh okay. So yes, I think, you know, it depends. It's going to be in the details here. It's a little bit hard on this call. But in some ways it sounds like you're mitigating risk with this software and that would be a lower risk review. Okay?

#### 10. Managing Sample Representation and Template Updates for EUA Submissions

QA Block 10-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are there any requirements for moderate or high positive sample representation, such as having approximately 50% of retrospective samples as high positive and 35% as moderate?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA aims to mimic the natural distribution of viral loads across high, moderate, and low positive samples. Retrospective studies should use consecutive samples over time to avoid bias. FDA advises discussing studies with banked samples through pre-EUA submissions to ensure compliance and eliminate bias.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are there any requirements for moderate or high positive sample representation, such as having approximately 50% of retrospective samples as high positive and 35% as moderate?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So what we're aiming is to try to mimic the natural distribution of a virus CT seen over a period of time after initiation of symptoms or for asymptomatics over a period of the program. We normally see when a prospective trial, a very usual sort of spectrum of high to low positive samples. And when people use banked samples we just want to reflect that. So there will be high positives, there will be low positives and there will be moderate positives. And that's the primary consideration. I would - if you're having a method we want to eliminate bias. So typically it's good to run your study design for using banked samples by the FDA through the pre-EUA submission, to make sure that depending on how you're doing it that you're not introducing bias that would prevent us from making a positive regulatory decision. So typically, when we use banked samples we want to use consecutive samples collected from one date to another rather than sort of selecting individuals in between others. So that we see sort of that more normal distribution. I would also caution and I've seen this happen, where a particular method of collection and types of banked samples that might be used, that it overemphasizes the low positives and it does have a tendency to show a poorer performance for the test and we're not wanting to do that. So, you know, be sure that the banked set of samples you're going to, reflects the normal distribution. And then if you randomly set - select those from one point in time, calendar day to another calendar day, all the intervening samples, positive and negatives, you're going to eliminate bias and you're going to help ensure that you don't have an overabundance of the low positives. And if you want a more detailed response than that I suggest submitting a pre- EUA to our team.
