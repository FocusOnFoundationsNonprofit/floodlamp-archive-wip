#### 1. FDA Updates on Testing, Safety, and Collaboration Strategies

QA Block 1-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Have any tests (molecular or serology) been authorized for use with a deceased person?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: No tests have been authorized for use with deceased persons. Manufacturers must seek authorization for such claims, though nucleic acid tests collected soon after death are preferable to serology due to challenges with post-mortem blood tests. Clinically drawn plasma or serum taken immediately before death may be suitable for serology.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Have any tests (molecular or serology) been authorized for use with a deceased person?
VERBATIM ANSWER: No, we haven't. Manufacturers should seek such authorization if they are going to address claims. And that clear lab as I said last week they can validate this sample type if they so choose as long as it's already a previously authorized for general use sample type. So we would also say that probably a nucleic acid test is collected soon after passing would be better than a serology. Obviously post mortem blood tests are challenging. If there are samples - serology types sample - plasma serum it's available immediately prior to death that was draw clinically, that may be a good sample type to use for such serology testing.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: Tests for deceased persons, Authorization for post-mortem samples

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What issues might arise from the use of saliva as a sample type for diagnostic testing, and how can these be addressed?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA finds saliva an interesting sample type as it is easy to collect and doesn't rely on swabs, which may be in short supply. However, results from saliva use have been variable, potentially due to stability issues. Only one authorized saliva device has shown excellent performance, but more research and submissions are needed to address variability.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What issues might arise from the use of saliva as a sample type for diagnostic testing, and how can these be addressed?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Saliva. Saliva remains a very interesting sample type. Obviously relatively easy to collect. Doesn't require any use of a swab which is sometimes in short supply. To date we've only authorized one saliva collection device for use with this specific test. The performance was quite excellent and we were pleased to see that excellent performance and the comparison between either nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs and the saliva. This was used at Rikers where they have a particular selection device for the use in a health care setting under observation. As well as the unintelligible coupled to thermal fisher ATPCR reagent. So this is somewhat of a hybrid authorization. To date we have seen otherwise quite variable results with saliva. We don't know exactly why. This could be a sample stability issue. But we clearly see that at least in one case this works. Whether this is a combination of particular devices or it's resulting from the use of a device that may stabilize the viral learning immediately.

They seek to harmonize data and involve stakeholders to enable evidence-based decision-making.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What additional data reporting strategies is the FDA considering to help track disease prevalence and inform decision-making?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We're looking at quite intensively now and that is how to track data that has been reported from tests that are being performed at a both molecularly and increasingly serological so that we can gain a better understanding of prevalence of the disease and its clinical course over time in specific regions. And I would envision that as sort of three different tiers of diagnostics. Data one, at the national level that's used by decision-makers who are making broad sweeping national decisions. The second, level of granularity at the state or local level that will help local decision-makers. And then a hyper-local or even individual clinician and patient-level set of information that includes things like comorbidities, other specific Electronic Health Record components for each patient that can help us better understand how accurate the testing was and follow the patient's clinical course through time. So we would be asking for your input, thoughts and collaboration on those aspects that help us harmonize data and use it clinically as well as understand from an epidemiological standpoint how the course of the pandemic is progressing and how that can inform good science-based and evidence-based decision making at every level.

VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes, as far as state allowances go so we have allowed states to authorize LDT tests for labs within their state jurisdiction. This is limited to LDTs in high complexity laboratories. One such program is obviously well-established sort of program is New York State which has been reviewing LDTs for a number of years prior to - for labs in their state. So they are well experienced. We have not specified how states decide how to authorize these high complexity LDT developed tests. We do leave that to the state. Labs within those states are still allowed to come into the FDA for EUA authorization. There are certain situations where those are required such as home testing or home collection. Also the particular devices that might be used such as saliva collection we would - and new sample types that haven't been authorized prior to the FDA- previously by the FDA or where we see a broad generalized applicability of our sample type we would ask that they come in as well. And we are also - I'm very open to working closely with each and every state that wants to do this and support their programs in any way we can to address any questions that we can. So hopefully that further clarifies and potential issues there.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Is there a process to remove tests authorized via EUA from the market if they are found to be ineffective or dangerous?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So there is a way to do that. We are fully are willing to deny an EUA authorization if on your review we cannot establish that there will be accurate testing. And if we determine that a test in the market is not performing I mentioned earlier the MedWatch we will first and foremost reach out to a developer and initiate conversation. And we will together try to find the best way forward to ensure that there is accurate testing available. At the beginning at the top of the call I mentioned an update about the Abbott ID Now, this exact pathway was followed. We had a conversation with the developer and together we decided, you know, we make decisions together on collaborative beyond on the best pathway forward. So that is our traditional way of handling these sorts of situations. We always first want to engage the developer to understand what the performance issues might be to try to understand what the root causes if there are in these performance issues. What the solution to those issues might be and what is the best way to address that as quickly as possible so that - for the benefit of the public health.

VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes. Yes. That was a great question. So first of all the long term authorization, so I do not personally foresee this emergency declaration going away any time soon or we are talking at least years. Where a potential market situation may occur is if a developer comes in for full FDA authorization whether that's De Novo or some other pathway and gets authorized. The EUA law allows for other similar devices to no longer be covered by the UA. This is only done very carefully though because we always want to assure there is plenty availability of test in the market as perhaps, you know, a single manufacturer though performance may be excellent we want to address market access to everyone to ensure that adequate volumes and number of tests can still be performed. So those decisions are made extremely carefully and the benefit risk of what we do is always addressed and we always air on the side of ensuring adequate availability of testing.

VERBATIM QUESTION: For serology tests, is the FDA anticipating them to be used in a professional environment with point-of-care designation and a clear waiver equivalent?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Second is, the use of serology tests in the professional environment i.e your patient testing point of care came to a clear waiver. We have the ability to when we authorize an EUA or a test that's amenable for use in these settings to sole deem it through language in the authorization. CMS has generously agreed to allow this process to occur. We are under the unintelligible any authorized test. We have provided a designation - a letter designation H for High, M for Moderate and W for Clear Waived or deemed clear waived in this case other than high complexity. And we are very open to reviewing tests for this. Tests that come solely through the notification process of Pathway D are not available for this deeming.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the validation requirements for tests under Pathway D?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Tests under Pathway D must be properly validated for the intended use, include necessary limitations, and cannot claim sole use for diagnosis. If standards are not adhered to, developers may face consequences. Tests are intended for use in high-complexity labs, which can independently verify performance.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the validation requirements for tests under Pathway D?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We through Pathway D we allowed test developers who had validated their test for the intended purpose reporting our IGM and IGG and or IGG or other serology endpoints that they could follow this pathway to certify to us and notify us that they had validated their test and that they could then receive confirmation from us and could market it in the U.S. The requirement for this pathway is that these tests be validated properly and also that they attach the limitations - there is forming limitations and that these claims could not include sole use for diagnosis. So there is obviously a standard here that must be adhered to. If that standard is not followed, if a developer has been transparent with us that would result in potential consequences. So the other important feature is that the formal EUA process is also to be followed - I mean it also can be followed and that is a fully EUA authorization pathway and for FDA EUA authorization. In addition, the Pathway D notify develop - notification for developers they intend - these are intended for high complexity labs in that environment high complexity labs can assess whether or not these tests on their own their performance can be verified.
