#### 4. Analytical Validation for SARS-CoV-2 At-Home Molecular Tests

QA Block 4-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the recent updates in the analytical validation template for SARS-CoV-2 molecular assays?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The updated template for SARS-CoV-2 molecular assays includes sections on standard material testing, which is separate from LOD requirements. After EUA is granted, standard material testing becomes part of the authorization condition. However, alternative paths for completing this work exist before authorization and can be evaluated case-by-case.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the recent updates in the analytical validation template for SARS-CoV-2 molecular assays?
VERBATIM ANSWER: This is about the analytical validation studies for SARS-CoV-2 assay that have been designed in compliance with the template, which was now of course, updated recently. So these new template sections are related to kind of the standard material that we're requesting folks to test. And the standard material testing section is kind of independent from the LOD. So that LOD test material can be a variety of different compositions. And I think those compositions are noted in the template. And the additional testing of a standard material is going to be added to the condition of authorization. So that's of course, after you received the EUA. And then if you prefer to complete this type of work prior to authorization, there are potentially other routes available. And I think those are available to you. And I think we would consider that type of approach on a case-by-case basis. And if you just want to send that in with a particular standard material in mind, that's something that we can consider it as an alternative approach.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends using an FDA-cleared molecular test as a comparator. If CT values are unavailable, FDA advises discussing alternative methods to establish low positives. They encourage reaching out if appropriate comparators are difficult to source and discussing alternative proposals.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is there any flexibility in the requirement for multi-analyte tests, such as those including influenza, to determine clinical performance for the non-SARS-CoV-2 analytes using an FDA-cleared molecular test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So we do recommend that the comparator for flu be an FDA-cleared device. And the CT values are important to ensure that there's a range of low to high positives. So if the comparator method does not provide CT values, we would recommend that you discuss with us, alternate ways to establish low positives. Notably, that's a different approach than our typical approach for flu 510ks, since those 510ks typically include a prospective clinical evaluation, which ensures that the samples are representative of the patient population. Without the prospective study design, we need something like the CT values to ensure that the samples are representative of the full range of patient populations. And we do recommend if you're having difficulty sourcing an appropriate comparator.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: For SARS-CoV-2 tests, if validated to 95% for the most challenging matrix, all common sample types in that category are generally authorized. However, for multianalyte tests, mid-turbinate specimens must be separately validated. Nasopharyngeal validation may support anterior nasal swab claims for multianalyte tests including influenza, but mid-turbinate requires separate validation.
VERBATIM QUESTION: If a clinical study for a SARS-CoV-2 test is conducted with nasopharyngeal swabs, will the intended use still include mid-turbinate and anterior nasal swab samples?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So for SARS-CoV-2 tests as long as you validate to 95% for the most challenging matrix in the category, so upper respiratory or lower respiratory, all common sample types in that category are generally included in the authorization. However, for multianalyte tests, we have seen data that there may be differences between specimen types especially for mid-turbinate. So we would want to see mid- turbinate swabs separately validated if requested as a specimen type. Nasopharyngeal validation may still support an anterior nasal swab claim for multianalyte test that includes influenza but we would want to see those mid-turbinate swabs validated separately.

TOPICS: Standard of care (SOC) requirements, OTC product EUA testing, Sample collection order
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 11-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the FDA consider the small bias introduced by SOC training for self-use patients during sample collection acceptable?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA prioritizes patient care above all else, and if proper patient protections are in place, studies can account for SOC training's influence on self-use sample collection.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA consider the small bias introduced by SOC training for self-use patients during sample collection acceptable?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So nothing should get in the way of patient care, right. So if the physician needs to take a sample to manage that patient, that should be of course the first priority and it should be done without delay. Then, if there's a study going on and you have the appropriate patient protections in place, then you could start talking about what else are we doing to this particular patient?

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is it acceptable for self-collection to occur immediately after standard of care to minimize bias in sample collection?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA considers self-collection immediately after the standard of care to be a less biased procedure, though randomized order is also acceptable. Care should be taken to avoid on-the-spot sample-collection training.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is it acceptable for self-collection to occur immediately after standard of care to minimize bias in sample collection?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah, I think in some cases, if the user is collecting their own sample there should be considerations that user isn't being trained kind of on the spot to collect their samples. So if you have the opportunity to have that self-collection happen immediately after the standard of care that's probably a least biased sample collection procedure. Certainly, some folks have randomized and that's acceptable as well, but I think I would say keep in mind the kind of self training aspect of that swabbing.

#### 12. Guidelines for OTC Test Authorization and Study Populations

QA Block 12-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are asymptomatic individuals, either positive or negative, required prior to authorization for an OTC home use test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends including both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals in clinical evaluations for OTC tests. If asymptomatic individuals cannot be included, authorization can be pursued using a supplemental template for serial testing, with a post-authorization condition to evaluate asymptomatic individuals.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are asymptomatic individuals, either positive or negative, required prior to authorization for an OTC home use test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So we do recommend in the template that your clinical evaluation include all comers, asymptomatic and symptomatic, when you're seeking an over-the-counter test. If you are not able to get asymptomatic individuals in your clinical study then the supplemental template for serial testing does include an option for serial testing authorization with only symptomatic individuals having been evaluated, and then a post authorization condition to evaluate in asymptomatic individuals.

VERBATIM ANSWER: So I think your best bet here is to follow the template and whatever materials are listed in that template is acceptable-- are certainly acceptable. If you have alternative approaches, that's something that we likely would want to follow up with an email or pre-EUA and make sure that we completely understand the material that you're proposing and the use for it just to make sure that all the details are kind of captured. Yeah, that's what I would recommend. Well, use the template inbox. Again, you can highlight this as something that came in from the town hall and we can give you written feedback fairly quickly. And just to further clarify, the discussion that we had earlier about the standard material testing was referring to some information in the molecular template not the antigen template. So you do want to make sure that you're taking a look at the antigen template if that's the type of test that you're developing. And the discussion about alternate materials related to the standard material testing for molecular was referring to what we generally include as a post authorization condition to evaluate the analytical limit of detection and traceability with an FDA recommended reference material.

#### 15. New Sample Stability Study Requirement for Molecular Testing

QA Block 15-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What prompted the FDA to add the additional requirement of a study specifically studying the stability of samples prior to testing?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA added the sample stability requirement due to observed stability issues and differences in sample types, such as new saliva samples and transitions from VTM to saline or PBS, in order to ensure accurate evaluations.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What prompted the FDA to add the additional requirement of a study specifically studying the stability of samples prior to testing?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah. Honestly we've seen issues of sample stability. Any time you take that sample the clock is somewhat ticking as far as how long that virus is going to be stable, the RNA is going to be stable, protein going to be stable. So really this is a standard evaluation we do in the 510k world, PMA world. And I think we were getting enough information from the field that stability was something that could be different. So we also have new samples. We have saliva samples now for SARS-CoV-2. We never really had saliva for upper respiratory samples.

#### 18. Requirements for Home Test Reporting and Clinical Usability Studies

QA Block 18-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is reporting test results to health care providers and public health authorities using appropriate LOINC and SNOMED codes required for at-home use kits?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA does not require LOINC and SNOMED reporting for home use kits, as legal requirements mainly apply to laboratories and practitioners. However, FDA encourages including an easy reporting option, as noted in its template, and may require it as a post-authorization condition.
VERBATIM QUESTION: There's a requirement for test results reporting and it says our test results will be reported to health care provider and public health authorities using appropriate LOINC and SNOMED. Is this required for at-home use kit?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So the reporting discussion in the template is, it's important because reporting to public health authorities is important for tracking the cases across the country. But there is only a requirement- - there's reporting legal requirements that do not fall under FDA so I won't get into that in specific detail, but those requirements are generally for laboratories and practitioners. Their requirements are not the same for a home user but we still do want to encourage reporting. And so the recommendations in the template are to encourage incorporation of an easy reporting option. And that is something that we have and will continue to include as a post authorization condition in certain cases where reporting is not able to be incorporated pre-authorization.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: How do clinical studies differ from flex studies in assessing variability in test use, and why are flex studies preferred for edge case evaluation?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Flex studies, conducted in controlled environments, are designed to test specific hypotheses, making them ideal for assessing edge cases. Clinical studies, while reflecting user variability, often lack the precision to draw firm conclusions about specific factors.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How do clinical studies differ from flex studies in assessing variability in test use, and why are flex studies preferred for edge case evaluation?
VERBATIM ANSWER: These flex studies are performed in a controlled manner and so the outcomes and the observations are kind of testing a hypothesis whereas if you're doing clinical study, yes, of course, there's going to be variability in how that test is being used. But it's difficult to draw any conclusions about what was actually kind of studied. So that's why the flex thing is much more appropriate to kind of look at the edge cases as far as use is concerned.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Why are home collection and at-home serology test EUA requests generally not being reviewed at this time?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA is prioritizing EUA requests for at-home and home collection tests for diagnostic purposes (molecular and antigen tests), not serology tests. This focus aims to avoid confusion and optimize public health priorities; templates for these serology tests have been removed from the FDA's website. The FDA will revisit this decision if future public health needs arise.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Why are home collection and at-home serology test EUA requests generally not being reviewed at this time?
VERBATIM ANSWER: We have updated our FAQ about priorities to be clear that we are prioritizing at home and home collection tests for diagnostic tests-- so molecular and antigen-- and not for serology tests. So with that, we've also removed the corresponding template from our website so that there's no confusion there. And we are generally declining to review EUA requests for home collection and at- home serology tests for the time being. If that changes in the future, if we determine that there's a public health priority to review those, we will announce that accordingly.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: What should be done if the comparator method does not provide CT values for low to high positive test ranges?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: If the comparator method does not provide CT values, FDA recommends discussing alternative methods to establish low positives and ensuring samples represent the full range of the patient population.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What should be done if the comparator method does not provide CT values for low to high positive test ranges?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So if the comparator method does not provide CT values, we would recommend that you discuss with us, alternate ways to establish low positives. Notably, that's a different approach than our typical approach for flu 510ks, since those 510ks typically include a prospective clinical evaluation, which ensures that the samples are representative of the patient population. Without the prospective study design, we need something like the CT values to ensure that the samples are representative of the full range of patient populations. And we do recommend if you're having difficulty sourcing an appropriate comparator. That you reach out to us to discuss that, what you've done to try to get that comparator, and discuss an alternate proposal that you may have.

VERBATIM QUESTION: Are multianalyte tests required to demonstrate separate validation data for mid-turbinate swabs?
VERBATIM ANSWER: For multianalyte tests, we have seen data that there may be differences between specimen types especially for mid-turbinate. So we would want to see mid- turbinate swabs separately validated if requested as a specimen type. Nasopharyngeal validation may still support an anterior nasal swab claim for multianalyte test that includes influenza but we would want to see those mid-turbinate swabs validated separately.

QA Block 10-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is it expected that the use of point-of-care test kits is observed by a human factors moderator or observer?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Observation of point-of-care test kit use by a human factors moderator is not a requirement but is regarded as a good practice. Additional discussions around lab interactions and training among technicians have not been considered extensively.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is it expected that the use of point-of-care test kits is observed by a human factors moderator or observer?
VERBATIM ANSWER: That's an interesting point. You know human factors is important and ensuring that you're getting information from the study to ensure that that test is being run appropriately is important. Also, there may be changes that could help improve test performance. So I don't believe it's a requirement for observation but certainly it sounds like a good practice. We haven't really discussed the inner workings of the laboratory and folks kind of training each other. It is an interesting point but it's something we really have not considered as far as--

QA Block 20-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can we leverage any study evaluating swabbing duration variability?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA acknowledges that flex studies in the templates address swabbing duration variability and assess the range where effective results can still be achieved. Other ongoing studies might contribute, but any relevant findings would be shared when available.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can we leverage any study evaluating swabbing duration variability?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yeah, so we do have recommendations for flex studies in the templates. And the flex studies are intended to get at just that. If there's a recommendation for 15 seconds we want to see sort of the range that will still give you an appropriate response. There are various efforts throughout the US government to do some additional studies. I'm not sure that there's much I can say about what studies may or may not be ongoing. I don't know of all of them. Different people are involved in different things but that's something where if that type of information is evaluated and becomes available we would make sure that that's communicated.
