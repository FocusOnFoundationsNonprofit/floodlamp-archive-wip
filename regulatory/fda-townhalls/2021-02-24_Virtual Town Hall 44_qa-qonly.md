#### 2. Usability vs. User Comprehension Studies in IVD Testing

QA Block 2-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What is the difference between usability studies and user comprehension studies in the validation process for COVID-19 diagnostic tests?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Usability studies evaluate whether users can properly use the device without serious errors, involving observational testing, sample assessments, and questionnaires. User comprehension studies assess users' understanding of critical labeling elements, particularly important for tests without healthcare provider involvement.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What is the difference between usability studies and user comprehension studies in the validation process for COVID-19 diagnostic tests?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Usability studies assess whether the intended user of the device can use the device properly without serious use errors or problems. And this testing typically would include an observational specimen of the users performing the testing, an assessment of the sample collected or the testing performed by the intended user and an interviewer questionnaire to assess the users' perspectives on the usability of the device. Our current template for molecular and antigen diagnostic tests for tests outside of healthcare settings the - and we refer to it as the non-lab or the home use test - or sorry template, does include a recommendation to assess the users' perspective on the usability of the device using a questionnaire consistent with the recommendations and our 2016 human factors guidance. I will note that the question last week referred to that 2016 human factors guidance. And I do want to point out that some of the details in that guidance while they are, the general concepts are applicable to IVDs, the - there are specific details that are necessary to consider for IVDs since the guidance document is written for evaluating user interfaces which is different from evaluating an IVD where that involves collecting a sample and performing a test as opposed to simply interfacing with a user interface. So that's - those are usability studies. And then separate from usability studies there are user comprehension studies. User comprehension studies are intended to objectively assess the intended users' understanding or comprehension of critical elements and concepts in the labeling. These studies are particularly important for tests that are intended for use by the users that do not include the involvement of a healthcare provider. The current template for non-lab tests does not discuss user comprehension studies but we do think that this is very important to assess especially for tests NWX-FDA OC where there's not healthcare provider involvement to consider user comprehension and assess the comprehension of labeling for devices where the results are returned to the lay user.

TOPICS: Usability studies, User comprehension studies, Validation process
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 2-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Why does the FDA recommend using questionnaires consistent with the 2016 human factors guidance for usability studies of diagnostic devices?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA recommends using questionnaires consistent with the 2016 human factors guidance in usability studies to assess user perspectives on device usability. The guidance is generally applicable to IVDs but requires specific considerations because IVD usability involves sample collection and testing rather than user interface interaction.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Why does the FDA recommend using questionnaires consistent with the 2016 human factors guidance for usability studies of diagnostic devices?

REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 2-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the specific considerations for usability studies of IVDs compared to other types of user interface evaluations?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Usability studies for IVDs assess whether the intended user can properly complete tasks such as collecting a sample and performing the test, rather than just interacting with a user interface. Additional considerations include an observational study of user actions, sample assessment, and a questionnaire, based on 2016 human factors guidance. Specific considerations for IVDs arise because they involve sample collection and testing.

QA Block 2-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Why doesn't the current template for non-lab tests include user comprehension studies, and when might these be added?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The current template for non-lab tests does not address user comprehension studies, but FDA recognizes their importance, particularly when no healthcare provider is involved. For serology tests, FDA is working on a template due to risks of user misinterpretation and misuse.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Why doesn't the current template for non-lab tests include user comprehension studies, and when might these be added?
VERBATIM ANSWER: The current template for non-lab tests does not discuss user comprehension studies but we do think that this is very important to assess especially for tests where there's not healthcare provider involvement to consider user comprehension and assess the comprehension of labeling for devices where the results are returned to the lay user. And I want to note particularly for serology tests -- and we are currently working on a template to provide recommendations for validation for serology tests performed outside of healthcare settings, there are significant risks associated with lay user misinterpretation and misuse of serology tests since they should not be used to diagnose acute infection and its unknown whether antibodies confirm immunity or protection from infection and if so how long that may last. The clinical significance of serology test results especially in individuals that have received vaccine is unknown.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: user comprehension studies, template updates, lay user risks
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 2-5
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What does the FDA recommend for addressing the risks of lay user misinterpretation of serology test results?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA highlights the need to assess user understanding of serology testing, including its limitations, due to risks of lay user misinterpretation and misuse. Serology tests should not diagnose acute infection, and the clinical significance of antibody presence remains uncertain.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What does the FDA recommend for addressing the risks of lay user misinterpretation of serology test results?
VERBATIM ANSWER: And I want to note particularly for serology tests -- and we are currently working on a template to provide recommendations for validation for serology tests performed outside of healthcare settings, there are significant risks associated with lay user misinterpretation and misuse of serology tests since they should not be used to diagnose acute infection and its unknown whether antibodies confirm immunity or protection from infection and if so how long that may last. The clinical significance of serology test results especially in individuals that have received vaccine is unknown. So given the current limitations of serology testing, lay users may misunderstand and potentially misuse serology test results. So it's particularly important to assess the users understanding of the test including its limitation.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Toby Lowe (FDA IVD Assoc Director)
TOPICS: Lay user risks, Serology test limitations, FDA recommendations
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 2-6
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the FDA's priorities for reviewing COVID-19 diagnostic tests, especially in different test categories (e.g., over-the-counter, prescription, point of care)?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA prioritizes reviewing COVID-19 tests such as home over-the-counter tests, home prescription tests, point-of-care tests, and high-throughput central lab tests, focusing on both molecular and antigen diagnostics.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the FDA's priorities for reviewing COVID-19 diagnostic tests, especially in different test categories (e.g., over-the-counter, prescription, point of care)?
VERBATIM ANSWER: I just want to reemphasize our current priorities for review at the FDA for tests. So obviously home over-the-counter tests including rapid antigen tests are a high priority as well as home prescription tests including rapid antigen tests. Also a point of care test including rapid antigen tests as well as extremely high throughput central lab tests pretty much of any sort. We're really looking for both molecular and antigen, the diagnostic test for the high throughput systems.

#### 3. Safety of Nasal Swabs for Children Under 14

QA Block 3-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the FDA have data suggesting that nasal swabs with no stopper are unsafe for children under 14 even for anterior nasal swabs?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA does not have data suggesting harm from anterior nasal swabs without a stopper, but developers are encouraged to consider safety features even for these swabs.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA have data suggesting that nasal swabs with no stopper are unsafe for children under 14 even for anterior nasal swabs?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So we're interested in safety in the home environment and especially when untrained non-healthcare people are doing swabbing at home. So for an anterior nasal swab it's clearly shown and in the study shows there's no harm done, that's good. If you're going to go further in than an anterior nasal swab such as a mid- turbinate swab that's at the point that we would like some sort of safety NWX-FDA OC features. And certainly we encourage developers to even for anterior nasal swabs to think about safety in that situation.

#### 4. Guidance on Serology Tests and Mutation Impact Evaluation

QA Block 4-2
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Is there any guidance on how to evaluate the performance of a serology test?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends analyzing the serology test's viral epitope for mutations using public databases and assessing impacts of changes. Developers should evaluate whether prevalent mutations affect performance and potentially use immune serum from patients carrying such mutations, though this is risk-based.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Is there any guidance on how to evaluate the performance of a serology test?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So for serology tests there's, you know, current thinking is there's, you know, some things that we can do. For example every serology developer would know the epitope that's of the virus that's being used. They know the sequence of amino acids. So you can check the known public databases for any prevalence mutations that impact the new assay sequence of your epitope in your assay. NWX-FDA OC Only if it does impact directly your epitope or if you have the means of assessing whether it's amino acid change outside the epitope could impact things. But I think, you know, right now the best way to go about this is to look at that epitope antigen that you're using in your assay and make sure there aren't any prevalent. And we usually use the 5% rule but check out the guidance 5% or below or 5% in total or below or it doesn't push the performance for the assay down below what we would usually expect to see for authorization. And obviously if you do have an epitope that has a prevalent mutation that leads to an amino acid change, you'll want to assess what the potential impact on that amino acid change is. Is it something - is it, you know, something shouldn't actually change too much, you know, it may be a very similar, you know, amino acid. But in all likelihood if it's changing amino acid, it may be due to immune function that may allow it to somewhat evade the patient's immune system. And so then how do you know beyond that for serology tests if it impacts? And that would probably involve trying to find immune serum or plasma by from a patient who carries that mutation or variant in order to assess that. But again it's all risk-based, so if that mutation or variant is less prevalent right now we may just authorize the test with labeling that says, you know, there's a potential, you know, problem with this mutation or with this assay.
SPEAKER QUESTION: Dee Dee Datra
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: serology test evaluation, mutation impact, test performance guidelines
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 4-3
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Can FDA recommend a source to obtain specimens positive for the most prevalent mutations right now?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA suggests immune plasma or serum from a patient exposed to the virus genotype affecting the assay, but currently does not have a recommendation or solution for obtaining such specimens.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Can FDA recommend a source to obtain specimens positive for the most prevalent mutations right now?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes it would be in the case of serology tests it would be immune plasm or serum from a patient known to have been exposed by the virus that could - genotype that could impact your assay. So that's obviously going to be a challenging sample for anybody to accumulate. So we're certainly in the process of looking into that. but I have no solution. I have no recommendation at this point unfortunately.

TOPICS: Specimen sourcing, Serology tests, Mutation challenges
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 4-4
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What does the FDA mean by the 5% rule when evaluating mutations?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA uses the 5% rule to evaluate mutations, indicating that mutations with a prevalence of 5% or below should not reduce assay performance below expected authorization standards.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What does the FDA mean by the 5% rule when evaluating mutations?
VERBATIM ANSWER: And we usually use the 5% rule but check out the guidance 5% or below or 5% in total or below or it doesn't push the performance for the assay down below what we would usually expect to see for authorization.
SPEAKER QUESTION: NOT APPLICABLE
SPEAKER ANSWER: Tim Stenzel (FDA IVD Director)
TOPICS: 5% rule, mutation evaluation, assay performance
REVIEW FLAG: False

QA Block 4-5
CLARIFIED QUESTION: How should a serology test developer assess the impact of non-epitope amino acid changes on assay performance?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA recommends examining public databases for prevalent mutations affecting the epitope's amino acid sequence, assessing their impact on assay performance using guidance thresholds like a 5% prevalence rule. Developers might also use serological samples from patients with relevant variants to evaluate performance.
VERBATIM QUESTION: IMPLICIT
VERBATIM ANSWER: So for serology tests there's, you know, current thinking is there's, you know, some things that we can do.

QA Block 4-6
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What are the risks involved in testing against less prevalent mutations or variants?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA uses a risk-based approach for less prevalent mutations or variants, potentially authorizing tests with labeling warning of a potential issue with the mutation or assay.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What are the risks involved in testing against less prevalent mutations or variants?
VERBATIM ANSWER: But again it's all risk-based, so if that mutation or variant is less prevalent right now we may just authorize the test with labeling that says, you know, there's a potential, you know, problem with this mutation or with this assay. But hopefully that's helpful enough and we hope, you know, that that immune serum will be available to developers.

#### 6. Mobile App Validation for Antigen Test Equivalency Across Platforms

QA Block 6-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Has the agency authorized any mobile medical applications for COVID-19 or otherwise that are supported on both iOS and Android?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA suggests validating mobile medical apps across various device models (both iOS and Android) due to differences in hardware and conditions (e.g., cameras, lighting). Analytical studies using positive samples can demonstrate equivalency without patient samples, and validated models should be clearly labeled.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Has the agency authorized any mobile medical applications for COVID-19 or otherwise that are supported on both iOS and Android?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Okay. So that obviously cell phones are different even within a family, you know, iOS or Android, the different models are available and have different cameras, different resolutions. Lighting may play a big role exactly how you hold something. And that could have differences between even within a family of cell phones models. So it's best if there is a study showing equivalency between those. They don't have to be on actual patient samples.

#### 9. Guidelines for Recruiting Subjects in Molecular Testing Studies

QA Block 9-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: What does FDA think about recruiting subjects who have had a positive antigen or PCR test in the past 48 hours for molecular test studies?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: FDA advises sponsors to present their study designs prior to starting when recruiting subjects who recently tested positive. Asymptomatic individuals can be included by linking testing programs and resampling positives, but the process must ensure blinding of prior results and include an appropriate ratio of negative samples as controls.
VERBATIM QUESTION: What does FDA think about recruiting subjects who have had a positive antigen or PCR test in the past 48 hours for molecular test studies?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes so this is something probably we want to take a look at prior to you starting this study if you don't want to have the study be at risk. But definitely I have publicly stated for accumulating multiple times I think on this town hall call and other settings as well that for enriching for asymptomatic individuals you can connect with some sort of regular testing program. And if they're positive then you can resample and use it in your test. We just want to know that design, when you do that we also of course want to see that you keep everybody blinded to the prior results and include at least equal number of negative results in that blinded retesting.

CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA differentiates by considering if the added marker impacts other elements of the assay. Inflammatory markers such as cytokines for COVID-19 are reviewed differently than SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests. For EUA, manufacturers should submit a pre-EUA detailing the intended addition, as certain unique panels may require specific review by an ancillary team.
VERBATIM QUESTION: How does the FDA distinguish between adding inflammatory markers and direct SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests under EUA requirements?
VERBATIM ANSWER: So can you tell me a little bit more details about your assay? Is this a molecular panel you're adding SARS-CoV-2 to other respiratory or what is this, you know, what are the non-COVID targets on this assay and what is it doing? Oh, so okay well, you know, we've authorized some IL-6 assays. I'm not sure other than IL-6 what we've done hasn't been either serology antigen or molecular including panels of respiratory viruses. I think this is specific enough that you ought to come with, you know, a pre- EUA with what you plan on doing to add that because it doesn't sound like you're adding a SARS test to a, you know, a SARS either serology or a NWX-FDA OC diagnostic to for identification of the virus or exposure of the virus to another serology or direct test. So it sounds like you have inflammatory markers for some other purpose and you want to add a COVID-19 related inflammatory marker or something to your - or, you know, apply for the use of your device for a COVID-19. And so that is a - going to be a little bit more unique and will depend on your given panel. In general when you're adding something to the panel depending on how that panel works if the wells are all independent and there's no, you know, there's no change in those independent wells and you're just adding a new well for SARS or wells for SARS and it has no direct impact on the other wells, then that is going to really make it a more streamlined to validate the addition of those new marker - that new marker or markers because what you're adding doesn't impact the results of the other markers of the analytical result in the other markers. On the other hand if there's some sort of, you know, everything together and you're adding SARS probes into already a mix that adding that into the mix could alter the performance of the other marker. So I really recommend that you just write up your idea and send it in as a pre-EUA. And that will be and likely go to one of our ancillary COVID teams that would review this type of application.

CLARIFIED QUESTION: Are modifications to panels considered 'streamlined' additions if new components do not affect other panel components?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: Yes, modifications to panels are considered streamlined if the new components (e.g., wells for SARS) are independent and do not impact the performance or results of other markers.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Are modifications to panels considered 'streamlined' additions if new components do not affect other panel components?
VERBATIM ANSWER: In general when you're adding something to the panel depending on how that panel works if the wells are all independent and there's no, you know, there's no change in those independent wells and you're just adding a new well for SARS or wells for SARS and it has no direct impact on the other wells, then that is going to really make it a more streamlined to validate the addition of those new marker - that new marker or markers because what you're adding doesn't impact the results of the other markers of the analytical result in the other markers. On the other hand if there's some sort of, you know, everything together and you're adding SARS probes into already a mix that adding that into the mix could alter the performance of the other marker.

#### 13. Comparative Performance of iOS and Android Devices in Testing

QA Block 13-1
CLARIFIED QUESTION: Does the FDA prioritize equivalency of data between platforms like iOS and Android rather than how the equivalency is achieved?
CLARIFIED ANSWER: The FDA prioritizes equivalency in the performance data between platforms like iOS and Android, considering potential differences in algorithms, cameras, and other factors. The labeling must ensure accurate results.
VERBATIM QUESTION: Does the FDA prioritize equivalency of data between platforms like iOS and Android rather than how the equivalency is achieved?
VERBATIM ANSWER: Yes I mean I don't know how you would carry out the clinical study portion of this for the users whether you would allow any of their devices to be used or whether you're going to use one specific device in those studies. And, you know, it might be better to have multiple. Whatever the patients have as a device you use that and you look at the overall performance. Separate from that we would, because you may only get one result from an Android this model X and whatever and only one result from an iOS model seven. So we want to know more data about the comparative performance if NWX-FDA OC it's actually doing the reading of the test and making the reading results available to the patient. And obviously there as we discussed before there could be different - they could yield different performance measures based on the fact that the algorithms might be different, and cameras might be different, the resolutions might be different. The background lighting conditions maybe - they may be less or more sensitive to that. The other thing I thought about it is there's all sorts of modes of taken a picture with a smart phone, you know, the essentially portrait, and landscape and, you know, night and day and all those things can, you know, potentially impact the accurate reading of the result. We just want to make sure that whatever, you know, you're going to put in your labeling that they're all going to be accurate results.
