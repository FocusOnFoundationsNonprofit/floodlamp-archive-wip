summary_short: The FDA Federal Register notice (published May 6, 2024) announces a draft guidance on an enforcement policy allowing certain laboratory manufacturers to offer validated, unauthorized “immediate response” in vitro diagnostic tests for CBRN threats when no section 564 EUA declaration is in place. It explains the conditions for this enforcement discretion—validation, FDA notification, transparency, prescription-only labeling, and use during the emergent window between detection and resolution or issuance of a 564 declaration—against the backdrop of FDA’s phaseout of general LDT enforcement discretion under the LDT Final Rule.

[Docket No. FDA-2024-D-0083]

Enforcement Policy for Certain In Vitro Diagnostic Devices for Immediate Public Health Response in the Absence of a Declaration under Section 564; Draft Guidance for Laboratory Manufacturers and Food and Drug Administration Staff; Availability

**AGENCY:** Food and Drug Administration, HHS.

**ACTION:** Notice of availability.

**SUMMARY:** The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of the draft guidance entitled “Enforcement Policy for Certain In Vitro Diagnostic Devices for Immediate Public Health Response in the Absence of a Declaration under Section 564.” In the context of emergent situations involving chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) threats, there may be a public health need for certain in vitro diagnostic devices (IVDs) to be available for immediate response purposes. When finalized, this guidance will describe the Agency’s enforcement policy for certain laboratory manufacturers offering certain unauthorized IVDs for immediate response to CBRN agents in the absence of a declaration applicable to IVDs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act). This draft guidance is not final nor is it for implementation at this time.

**DATES:** Submit either electronic or written comments on the draft guidance by [INSERT DATE 60 DAYS AFTER DATE OF PUBLICATION IN THE _FEDERAL REGISTER_] to ensure that the Agency considers your comment on this draft guidance before it begins work on the final version of the guidance.

**ADDRESSES:** You may submit comments on any guidance at any time as follows:

**SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:**
### I. Background
When finalized, this guidance will describe the Agency’s enforcement policy for certain laboratory manufacturers offering certain unauthorized IVDs for immediate response to CBRN agents in the absence of a declaration applicable to IVDs under section 564 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (hereafter referred to as an “applicable 564 declaration”).[^1] In the context of emergent situations involving CBRN threats, there may be a public health need for certain IVDs to be available for immediate response purposes. An emergent situation is, for purposes of this guidance, the period of time between detection of the exposure or outbreak and, either, resolution of the exposure or outbreak or issuance of an applicable 564 declaration. In the past, during this period of time, laboratory manufacturers offered laboratory developed tests (LDTs) for which FDA has had a general enforcement discretion approach. However, as discussed in the preamble to the final rule amending FDA regulations to make explicit that IVDs are devices under the FD&C Act including when the manufacturer of the IVD is a laboratory (LDT Final Rule)[^2], FDA is phasing out this general enforcement discretion approach for LDTs. Accordingly, FDA is issuing this guidance with our enforcement policy for “immediate response” tests.

This guidance, when finalized, will describe the Agency’s enforcement policy for certain laboratory manufacturers offering certain unauthorized IVDs for immediate response to CBRN agents in the absence of an applicable 564 declaration. FDA does not intend to object to the offering of “immediate response” tests, as defined in the guidance, when the test is manufactured and offered by certain laboratory manufacturers, the test has been appropriately validated, FDA is notified, appropriate transparency is provided, the test is labeled for prescription use only, and there is no applicable 564 declaration, as described in the guidance. Prior to an emergent situation and after an emergent situation has been resolved, when there might not be a critical need for a coordinated and immediate public health response and where the implications of false results may not have as serious implications for public health decision-making, such tests may fall within the enforcement discretion policies described in section V.B of the preamble to the LDT Final Rule.

This draft guidance is being issued consistent with FDA’s good guidance practices regulation (21 CFR 10.115). The draft guidance, when finalized, will represent the current thinking of FDA on “Enforcement Policy for Certain In Vitro Diagnostic Devices for Immediate Public Health Response in the Absence of a Declaration under Section 564.” It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations.
