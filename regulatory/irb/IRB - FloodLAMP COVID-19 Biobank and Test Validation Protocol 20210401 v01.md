| Sponsor | FloodLAMP Biotechnologies, PBC 930 Brittan Ave San Carlos, CA 94070 ||
| Investigational Products | FloodLAMP QuickColor TM Test, FloodLAMP QuickFluor TM Test, FloodLAMP EasyPCR TM Test, FloodLAMP Home Collection Kit ||
| Instruments and Software | RT-PCR Instruments, FloodLAMP Mobile App ||
| Controls | Not Provided but necessary: external positive control for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and to monitor functioning of reagents along with a negative control, to monitor for contamination during sample processing. ||
| Proposed Intended Use | The FloodLAMP COVID-19 Tests comprise several molecular assays that utilize a streamlined sample preparation protocol. The assays include polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcriptase loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP). The tests are intended for the qualitative detection of RNA from SARS-CoV-2 in anterior nares (nasal) swab specimens from individuals suspected of COVID-19 by their healthcare provider and from individuals without symptoms or other epidemiological reasons to suspect COVID-19 infection. Testing is limited to laboratories certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA), 42 U.S.C. §263a, to perform high complexity tests, or by similarly qualified non-U.S. laboratories. Sample pooling is at a baseline level of 4, with on-site and at-home modalities. Pooling of pools to levels greater than 20 will be investigated pending LoD determination and validation studies. Results are for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA is generally detectable in upper respiratory specimens during the acute phase of infection. Positive results are indicative of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA; clinical correlation with patient history and other diagnostic information is necessary to determine patient infection status. Positive results do not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease. Laboratories within the United States and its territories are required to report all positive results to the appropriate public health authorities. Negative results do not preclude SARS-CoV-2 infection and should not be used as the sole basis for patient management decisions. Negative results must be combined with clinical observations, patient history, and epidemiological information. The assay is intended for use by qualified and trained clinical laboratory personnel specifically instructed and trained in the techniques of real-time PCR and in vitro diagnostic procedures. The assay is only for use under the Food and Drug Administration’s Emergency Use Authorization. Use of the FloodLAMP QuickColor TM Test in a general, asymptomatic screening population is intended to be used as part of an infection control plan that may include additional preventative measures, such as a predefined serial testing plan or directed testing of high-risk individuals. Negative results do not preclude current or future infection obtained through community transmission or other exposures. Negative results must be considered in the context of an individual’s recent exposures, history, and presence of clinical signs and symptoms consistent with COVID-19. ||
| Study Overview | The study will include up to 100,000 unique clinical specimens (will depend on prevalence in the intended population) from across at least 3 geographically diverse testing in the United States. Additional sample collection sites may be brought on to ensure sufficient enrollment for the study. ||
| Clinical Specimen Categories | Fresh Prospective Frozen Prospective ||
| Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria | Inclusion: The specimen is an anterior nasal swab and QR code labeled tube included with the FloodLAMP Home Collection Kit. The swab specimen can be tested within 56 hours or less after collection. If frozen, specimens are to be stored at ≤-70℃ until tested. Subjects with any of the following: Suspected of COVID-19, whether or not symptomatic Not experiencing symptoms and/or who have not notified a physician that they suspect they have COVID-19 Had a positive COVID-19 test within the last 10 days The specimen is from a consenting male or female subject of any age Exclusion: The specimen was not properly collected, identified, transported, processed, or stored according to the instructions provided by the sponsor. The specimen was not collected under informed consent. ||

## 1. INTRODUCTION
### 1.1. BACKGROUND
The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the value for new modalities of public health focused testing and screening. FloodLAMP's molecular tests and home collection kit combine streamlined extractionless, ultra-low cost, supply chain robust assay protocols with highly scalable at-home and on-site sample collection. Together these enable the new type of mass screening of interacting populations, such as schools and workplaces, to safely reopen society. Furthering this capability is needed (along with vaccines) to ultimately overcome the COVID-19 crisis, first in the U.S., then globally.

The populations most susceptible include the elderly over 65 years old and individuals who have preexisting comorbidities, including diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease.

### 1.2. STUDY RATIONALE
The scope of the study is to validate the FloodLAMP COVID-19 Tests and Home Collection Kit with up to 100,000 unique clinical specimens from across three geographically diverse testing sites in the United States. Number of enrolled patients should be sufficient to ensure at least 20 positive samples are prospectively collected in the intended use populations. The results will be analyzed and compared against results from a CLIA lab that can run an EUA comparator test on dry swabs.

### 1.3. SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION
Will depend on the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the intended use populations.

## 2. INVESTIGATIONAL DEVICE PROPOSED INTENDED USE STATEMENT
FloodLAMP QuickColor<sup>TM</sup> COVID-19 Test and FloodLAMP QuickFluor<sup>TM</sup> COVID-19 Test are reverse transcriptase loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay. The FloodLAMP EasyPCR<sup>TM</sup> COVID-19 Test is a real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay. The tests are intended for the qualitative detection of RNA from SARS-CoV-2 in upper respiratory specimens including nasopharyngeal swabs, anterior nasal and mid-turbinate nasal swabs from individuals suspected of COVID-19 by their healthcare provider and from individuals without symptoms or other epidemiological reasons to suspect COVID-19 infection, when tested at a weekly interval with no more than 9 days between tests. Testing is limited to laboratories certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA), 42 U.S.C. §263a, to perform high complexity tests, or by similarly qualified non-U.S. laboratories.

Results are for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA is generally detectable in upper respiratory specimens including nasopharyngeal swabs, anterior nasal and mid-turbinate nasal swabs during the acute phase of infection. Positive results are indicative of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA; clinical correlation with patient history and other diagnostic information is necessary to determine patient infection status. Positive results do not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease. Laboratories within the United States and its territories are required to report all test results to the appropriate public health authorities.

Negative results do not preclude SARS-CoV-2 infection and should not be used as the sole basis for patient management decisions. Negative results must be combined with clinical observations, patient history, and epidemiological information.

The FloodLAMP COVID-19 Tests are intended for use by qualified and trained clinical laboratory personnel specifically instructed and trained in the techniques of *in vitro* diagnostic procedures. The FloodLAMP COVID-19 Tests are only for use under the Food and Drug Administration’s Emergency Use Authorization.

## 3. STUDY OBJECTIVE
The objective of this study is to generate clinical performance data for the FloodLAMP QuickColor<sup>TM</sup> COVID-19 Test, FloodLAMP QuickFluor<sup>TM</sup> COVID-19 Test, FloodLAMP EasyPCR<sup>TM</sup> COVID-19 Test, and the FloodLAMP Home Collection Kit.

## 4. STUDY DESIGN OVERVIEW
### 4.1. PROTOCOL SUMMARY
The purpose of this study is to determine the accuracy and usability of the FloodLAMP COVID-19 Tests and Home Collection Kit in the intended populations compared to a CLIA lab that can run an EUA comparator test on dry swabs. The primary outcome of the study will be to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the FloodLAMP COVID-19 Tests and usability of the Home Collection Kit.

Three modes of sample collection will be stratified:

**Variation 1**: The collection site is co-located with a current testing program for Persons Suspected of COVID that is utilizing a high sensitivity EUA PCR test, e.g., adjacent to Stanford or San Francisco city testing site. After completion of the EUA test specimen collection, the participant would be asked if they would like to participate in the FloodLAMP research study. If the participant accepts, a self-collection kit would be offered, and participants would collect according to printed instructions. Optionally, they may be asked if they would like to download the FloodLAMP app and follow collection instructions through the app. Participants would place the collected specimen tube in a biobag and deposit the biobag in a collection bin.

**Variation 2**: FloodLAMP would independently run a physical or mobile site (e.g., at tent outside the FloodLAMP lab in a parking lot), in the form of a drive thru. A self-collection kit would be picked up by participants or be handed through a car window. Specimens would be collected in the car according to instructions (printed or through app), specimen tubes placed in a biobag, and deposited into a collection bin.

**Variation 3**: Self-collection kits will be distributed, either at the sites described above, other physical locations or through delivery by mail or courier. These are termed "home" collection kits though they may be utilized in a workplace setting, in a car, or at other locations. The home kits will include variations for self-collection of both pooled specimens and individual collected samples. The home collection may include testing of the FloodLAMP app and involve user factors testing with surveys and other interactions with participants.

In all three variations, initial studies will comprise collection of two anterior nares swabs whereby the order of collection is randomized. In Variations 2 & 3, one swab would be sent to a CLIA lab to run an EUA approved Comparator test. The other swab would be used to run the FloodLAMP COVID-19 Tests. Subsequent studies may include collection of other specimen types, including saliva.

Recruitment would be performed online or through other standard means. Optionally, self-collection kits for multiple collections may be provided. Specimens may be pooled for validation studies.

Variations in the self-collection kits will include both supervised and unsupervised versions. Supervision may be provided in person at physical sites or remotely through video for collection in a participant's home or car.

### 4.2. PRIMARY MEASURE OF PERFORMANCE
The results of the FloodLAMP COVID-19 Tests will be compared against results from a reference test for the same set of patient specimens.

**<u>Examination and Interpretation of Patient Specimen Results</u>:**

Assessment of the FloodLAMP COVID-19 Tests of clinical specimen test results should be performed after the positive and negative controls have been examined and determined to be valid and acceptable. If the controls are not valid, the patient results cannot be interpreted. Results will be interpreted according to the Instructions for Use.

### 4.3. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
Upon completion of the clinical validation studies, Positive and Negative Agreement for each target will be calculated and data stratified as previously described.
