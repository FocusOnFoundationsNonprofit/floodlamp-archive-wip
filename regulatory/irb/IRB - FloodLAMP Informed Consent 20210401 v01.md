## Part 1: Information and Consent Form

**Why is this research being done?**

The purpose of this study is to collect biological samples (also called specimens) for research use in FloodLAMP's laboratory. Examples of biological samples include blood, saliva, nasal swabs, throat swabs, nostril swabs, and cheek swabs. These samples may be used to develop new tests and/or evaluate and improve existing tests such as tests to detect viruses such as SARS-CoV-2.

The researchers in this study are employees of and own equity interest in the sponsor company,  
FloodLAMP Biotechnologies, PBC. Please feel free to ask any further questions you might have about this matter.

**How many people will be in this study?**  
We may enroll up to 100,000 people in this research study.

**What will happen if I join this study?**  
We will ask you to sign this Consent Form prior to collection of your biological specimens, and we may ask you to complete a short survey. Your participation in this study is voluntary. You are not required to answer any additional questions and can always say "No". If you choose to participate in this study, we will ask you to affirm that you have read and agree to the study consent form by signing your name.

We will then ask you to provide one or more biological samples including blood, saliva, sputum,  
nasal (nasopharyngeal), throat (oropharyngeal), nostril (anterior nares), and check (buccal).  
Samples will be self-collected and/or collected by trained personnel.

* **Blood Draw:** To donate a blood sample, you will have your blood drawn (about 1  
  tablespoon). It will take you about 10-15 minutes to donate a blood sample.  
* **Saliva Spit:** To donate a saliva sample, you will spit (about 2 teaspoons) directly into a collection container. It will take you about 5 minutes to donate each saliva sample.  
* **Sputum Cough:** To donate a sputum sample, you will first rinse your mouth with water and then produce a deep cough that produces mucus, which you will spit directly into a collection container. It will take you about 5 minutes to donate each sputum sample.  
* **Nasopharyngeal (NP) Swab:** To donate a nasopharyngeal sample you will tilt your head back, and a swab will be inserted in your nostril. The swab will be left in place for several seconds to absorb secretions before removing. This procedure may be performed in both nostrils. It will take you about 5 minutes to donate each nasopharyngeal sample.  
* **Oropharyngeal (Throat) Swab:** To donate an oropharyngeal sample, a swab will be inserted into your mouth and the back and sides of your throat will be swabbed (posterior pharynx and tonsillar areas). It will take you about 5 minutes to donate each oropharyngeal sample  
* **Anterior Nares (AN, Nasal) Swab:** To donate an anterior nares sample, you will insert a swab into your nostril and swab the inside of your nostril. Repeat for the other nostril. It will take you about 5 minutes to donate each anterior nares sample.  
* **Buccal (Cheek) Swab:** To donate a buccal sample, you will insert a swab into your mouth between the cheek and upper gum and swab the inner cheek. It will take you about 5 minutes to donate each buccal swab sample.

At the time of donation, we will also describe the collection method for each sample type in-person. You are not required to provide any or all of the requested sample types, and you can always say "No".

All samples will be collected on an as-needed and volunteer basis. Your sample will not be labeled with any of your identifiable information but will be assigned a unique code for re-contacting purposes. We may re-contact you by phone or email sometime in the future to collect another set of samples. You are not required to provide another set of samples, and you can always say "No".

Your participation in this study involves you giving broad consent. This means that you allow your information and samples to be used for a variety of future research which will be reviewed by an Independent Review Board (IRS), but which cannot be specified at this present time.

**Will I receive results?**  
No, you will not receive any results as part of this research study.

**What are my other options?**  
This is not a treatment trial. You may choose not to participate in this study.

**What are the benefits of participating in the study?**  
There is no direct benefit to you for participating in this research study. However, by participating in this research study, you are contributing to scientific knowledge that may lead to new discoveries that could indirectly benefit you or your family members.

**What are the risks or discomforts of the study?**  
The risk of participating in this study is minimal. For blood draws, you may experience bruising and swelling around the puncture site, dizziness or fainting, or infection (rare) during the blood draw.

For nasal swabs and throat swabs, you may experience some mild pain or feel a little discomfort  
during the collection process. You may gag a little or experience a minor nosebleed after some of the swab collection processes. You can stop or withdraw from providing a sample at any time.

There is a potential risk of breach of confidentiality.

There may be other risks to you that are unknown.

**Will it cost me anything to be in this study?**  
No, there is no cost to you to participate in this research study.

**Will I be paid if I join this study?**  
Participation in this study is voluntary and you are not guaranteed payment. However, some sample collection visits and/or surveys may be eligible for monetary or cash equivalents in the form of gift cards, as compensation for your time, travel, and/or any other inconveniences related to your participation. If you are eligible for a sample collection visit and/or survey that offers compensation, you will be provided additional information about compensation prior to your visit.

**How long is the study?**  
The study does not currently have a set end date, but your active participation ends after completion of specimen collection and the survey. We may re-contact you by phone or email sometime in the future to request another set of samples

**Can I leave the study early?**  
Yes. Your participation in this research study is voluntary. You may choose not to participate or
