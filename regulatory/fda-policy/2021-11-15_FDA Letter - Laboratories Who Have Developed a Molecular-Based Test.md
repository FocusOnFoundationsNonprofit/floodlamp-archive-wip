summary_short: The FDA “Laboratories Who Have Developed a Molecular-Based Test” letter (Nov 15, 2021) reissues and narrows an EUA for certain molecular laboratory-developed tests listed in Appendix A, authorizing them only for qualitative SARS-CoV-2 detection in respiratory specimens from individuals suspected of COVID-19 by a healthcare provider. It explains that no additional tests will be added under this EUA and updates conditions and fact sheets to reflect the current phase of the pandemic and FDA’s shift toward separate serial screening/pooling pathways. It also sets enforceable conditions for authorized single-lab use (CLIA high complexity), reporting, labeling, adverse event tracking, and ongoing evaluation of viral mutation impacts.

To:  
Laboratories with tests listed in Appendix A.

Authorized Tests:  
Tests listed in Appendix A.<sup>1</sup>

Indication:  
Qualitative detection of nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory specimens collected from individuals suspected of COVID-19<sup>2</sup> by their healthcare provider. Use of the test is limited to the authorized laboratory.

Authorized Laboratories:  
Testing is limited to the single laboratory that developed the authorized test and that is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA), 42 U.S.C. §263a, and meets the requirements to perform tests of high complexity. The authorized laboratory for each authorized test is listed in Appendix A.

On February 4, 2020, pursuant to Section 564(b)(1)(C) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) determined that there is a public health emergency that has a significant potential to affect national security or the health and security of United States citizens living abroad, and that involves the virus that causes COVID-19. Pursuant to Section 564 of the Act, and on the basis of such determination, the Secretary of HHS then declared that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of in vitro diagnostics for detection and/or diagnosis of the virus that causes COVID-19 subject to the terms of any authorization issued under Section 564(a) of the Act.<sup>3</sup>

On March 31, 2020, in response to this evolving public health emergency and continued concerns about the availability of sufficient in vitro diagnostic tests, FDA issued this EUA for certain molecular-based laboratory developed tests (LDTs) for use by the single developing laboratory (as described in the Scope of Authorization (Section II)) under Section 564 of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3). Under this EUA, authorized tests are authorized for use only in the single laboratory that developed the authorized test and that is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA), 42 U.S.C. §263a, and meets the requirements to perform tests of high complexity.

FDA has continued to periodically review the circumstances and the appropriateness of authorizing the emergency use of tests under this EUA as required by Section 564(g)(1) of the Act since it was issued on March 31, 2020. Based on this review and all available information, FDA has concluded that the criteria for issuance under Section 564(c) of the Act are met with respect to the authorized tests and has also determined that it is no longer appropriate to include any additional authorized tests under this EUA. As described below, FDA’s decision to reissue this EUA pursuant to Section 564(c) of the Act is based in part on the changing circumstances of this pandemic. This includes a significant shift towards tests that can be used with pooled specimens that are collected as part of a serial testing program for screening. Such tests are outside the scope of this EUA. Given this, FDA is reissuing this EUA such that only tests that are listed in Appendix A are authorized for use as described in Section II of this letter when used consistent with the Conditions of Authorization (Section IV). FDA has updated the Conditions of Authorization and also updated the fact sheets to reflect the most up-to-date information as part of this reissuance.

FDA may authorize additional tests, as appropriate, either in individual EUAs or under a new umbrella EUA. At this stage of the pandemic, FDA intends to focus its review on the types of tests needed to meet the current public health needs, including tests intended for use as part of serial screening testing programs. Serial screening testing programs are expected to be a cornerstone of the current phase of the country’s pandemic response as many schools, workplaces, communities, and other entities are setting up testing programs to rapidly screen for COVID-19, and FDA is providing streamlined approaches for authorization of tests intended for use in these programs. FDA will review individual EUA requests for tests based on a number of factors and may issue an EUA when the statutory criteria for issuance are met.

Having concluded that the criteria for issuance under Section 564(c) of the Act are met with respect to the tests listed in Appendix A of this letter, I am authorizing the emergency use of the tests listed in Appendix A as described in the Scope of Authorization (Section II) and pursuant to the Conditions of Authorization (Section IV) to detect SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory specimens from individuals suspected of COVID-19 by their healthcare provider for use in the single laboratory that developed the authorized test and that is certified under the CLIA, 42 U.S.C. § 263a, and meets the requirements to perform tests of high complexity.

## I. Criteria for Issuance of Authorization
I have concluded that the emergency use of the authorized tests listed in Appendix A of this reissued letter of authorization meet the criteria for issuance of an authorization under Section 564(c) of the Act, because I have concluded that:

1. The SARS-CoV-2 can cause a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, including severe respiratory illness, to humans infected by this virus;

2. Based on the totality of scientific evidence available to FDA, it is reasonable to believe that the authorized tests may be effective in diagnosing COVID-19, and that the known and potential benefits of the authorized tests when used for diagnosing COVID-19, outweigh the known and potential risks of the authorized tests; and

3. There is no adequate, approved, and available alternative to the emergency use of the authorized tests.<sup>4</sup>

## II. Scope of Authorization
I have concluded, pursuant to Section 564(d)(1) of the Act, that the scope of this authorization is limited to the authorized tests listed in Appendix A for the indication above.

Authorized Tests

Tests listed in Appendix A, when labeled consistent with the authorized test procedures and as described in the authorized test’s EUA summary (available at [FDA EUA Summary](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-emergency-use-authorizations-medical-devices/in-vitro-diagnostics-euas-molecular-diagnostic-tests-sars-cov-2)), are authorized to be used by the single laboratory that developed the authorized test, despite the fact that they do not meet certain requirements otherwise required by applicable federal law.

Authorized tests must be accompanied by the following product information pertaining to their emergency use, which is required to be made available to healthcare providers and patients:

- Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers: Molecular LDT COVID-19 Authorized Test
- Fact Sheet for Patients: Molecular LDT COVID-19 Authorized Test

These facts sheets, the authorized test procedures, and the authorized test’s EUA summary are collectively referred to below as the “authorized labeling” for each authorized test.

I have concluded, pursuant to Section 564(d)(2) of the Act, that it is reasonable to believe that the known and potential benefits of the authorized tests outweigh the known and potential risks of such authorized tests.

I have concluded, pursuant to Section 564(d)(3) of the Act, based on the totality of scientific evidence available to FDA, that it is reasonable to believe that the authorized tests listed in Appendix A may be effective for the indication above, when used consistently with the Scope of Authorization of this letter (Section II), pursuant to Section 564(c)(2)(A) of the Act.

FDA has reviewed the scientific information available to FDA, including the information supporting the conclusions described in Section I above, and concludes that the authorized tests (as described in the Scope of Authorization of this letter (Section II)) meet the criteria set forth in Section 564(c) of the Act concerning safety and potential effectiveness.

The emergency use of the authorized tests under this EUA must be consistent with, and may not exceed the terms of this letter, including the Scope of Authorization (Section II) and the Conditions of Authorization (Section IV).

Conditions of Authorization (Section IV). Subject to the terms of this EUA and under the circumstances set forth in the Secretary of HHS's determination under Section 564(b)(1)(C) of the Act described above and the Secretary of HHS’s corresponding declaration under Section 564(b)(1) of the Act, the tests are authorized for the indication above.

This EUA will cease to be effective when the HHS declaration that circumstances exist to justify the EUA is terminated under Section 564(b)(2) of the Act or when the EUA is revoked under Section 564(g) of the Act.
