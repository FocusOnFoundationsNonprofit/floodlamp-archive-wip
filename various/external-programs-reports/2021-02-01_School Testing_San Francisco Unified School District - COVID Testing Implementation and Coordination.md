## 1.2 Background of the San Francisco Unified School District
**What is the SFUSD?**
San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD) is the seventh largest school district in California, educating over 57,000 students every year who speak more than 44 languages across 132 schools in San Francisco. We aim for every student who attends SFUSD schools to discover his or her spark, along with a strong sense of self and purpose, and that all students graduate from high school ready for college and career, and equipped with the skills, capacities and dispositions outlined in SFUSD's Graduate Profile. San Francisco is both a city and a county; therefore, SFUSD administers both the school district and the San Francisco County Office of Education (COE). This makes SFUSD a "single district county."

## 1.3 Statement of Need and Intent
**What Does SFUSD Seek?**
On January 14, 2021, the California Department of Public Health released its guidance on school testing titled [COVID-19 K-12 School Testing Considerations Information 1-14-21](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Pages/PageNotFoundError.aspx?requestUrl=https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/K12_School_Testing_Considerations_Information.pdf). This release mandates School Districts to adopt a scalable COVID-19 testing program as part of their plans to return to in-person learning. Through this RFP, the District seeks to ensure the availability of accessible student and staff asymptomatic testing for two purposes 1) surveillance COVID-19 testing and 2) screening testing to mitigate the spread of the disease and to protect the health and safety of the SFUSD community. To this end, the District would like obtain one or more contracts with with a firm to integrate, assemble, staff and manage end-to-end testing for its testing program with the operational flexibility to adapt to multiple testing contexts, populations, changing technology, and fluctuating demand during this pandemic based on the Tier the county is in.

The Vendor shall manage all aspects of a comprehensive student and staff asymptomatic testing program for COVID-19, ensure that the solutions across all Work Threads are operationally-integrated, provide testing turnaround times that are between 24-48 hours, manage reporting needs and requests, and be the District's single point of contact for all testing issues under the scope of work. The Vendor must be able to handle high volumes of appointments across multiple collection site types (e.g., walk-through and/or drive-through stationary sites, mobile units). Daily collection volumes will vary by collection site and could range from 2,000-3,000 daily samples across all sites for a total of 10,000 to 15,000 weekly. The volume may decrease as CDPH and SFDPH guidance changes.

The Asymptomatic testing will begin March 15, 2021 and operate for 12-18 months from the start date. The vendor will work with the District to create an Asymptomatic testing calendar and scheduling that will be posted to SFUSD's website for staff to access. The volume of testing will vary based on the County Tier per the [California Department of Public Health](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/Consolidated_Schools_Guidance.pdf) Consolidate Schools Framework:

- **Red and Purple Tier**: Every 2 weeks asymptomatic screening testing for 5,000 staff and 10,000 students. Bi-Weekly asymptomatic testing assumes the use of a PCR test. If antigen testing is used, testing should be at a twice weekly cadence.
- **Orange & Yellow Tier**: Asymptomatic screening testing per [SFPH school guidelines](https://www.sfdph.org/dph/alerts/covid-guidance/2020-33-Guidance-TK12-Schools.pdf): A sampling of students and staff, frequency to be determined by SFDPH.

Proposers may be a single firm or a partnership of the primary firm and its subcontractor(s) who are able to deliver a complete testing program comprising the Scope of Work described in Section 2.

## 5. Evaluation Criteria
This section describes the guidelines used for analyzing and evaluating the Proposals. Any Proposer(s) selected from this RFP are not guaranteed a contract. This RFP does not in any way limit the District's right to solicit contracts for similar or identical services if, in the District's sole and absolute discretion, it determines the RFP does not meet its needs. As in all contracts, the District reserves the right to accept other than the lowest price offer and reject all proposals that are not responsive to this request.

There are two phases to the evaluation process. District staff first performs an Initial Screening as described in Section 5.1. Proposals that pass the Initial Screening process (5.1) including Minimum Qualifications (5.2) will proceed to the Evaluation of Firms (that met Minimum Qualifications) described in Section 5.3.

District representatives will serve as the Evaluation Team responsible for evaluating the proposals, and the District reserves the right to include subject-matter experts from other public entities and institutions. Specifically, the team will be responsible for the evaluation and scoring of the Proposals, and for interviews, if desired by the District.

### 5.1 Initial Screening
The District will review each Proposal for initial determination on responsiveness and acceptability in an Initial Screening process. Elements reviewed during the Initial Screening include, without limitation: compliance with format requirements, Proposal completeness, compliance with Minimum Qualification requirements (Section 5.2), and inclusion of verifiable Past Project References (Section 5.3.1.C).

Proposals are not scored during the Initial Screening process. Initial Screening is a pass/fail determination as to whether a Proposal meets the threshold requirements described above. Any Proposal that does not demonstrate that Proposer meets requirements in Section 5.1 will not be eligible for consideration in the Evaluation of Firms (that met Minimum Qualifications) described below in Section 5.3. The District reserves the right to request clarification from the Proposer prior to rejecting a Proposal for failure to meet the Initial Screening requirements. Clarifications are "limited exchanges" between the District and a Proposer for the purpose of clarifying certain aspects of the Proposal and will not give a Proposer the opportunity to revise or modify its Proposal.

### 5.2 Minimum Qualifications Checklist
Proposer must check each below requirement either as "Yes" or "No." An answer of "No" will result in failure to meet the Minimum Qualifications.

- One (1) or more stationary specimen collection District-directed testing sites with walk-through and drive-through capacity and a combined average daily volume of 2,500 tests; and
- One (1) mobile specimen collection unit with walk-through capacity with an average daily volume of 250 tests

For this portion of the cost proposal, costs for use of District directed sites (e.g., leases and permitting) will be covered by the District and should not be included here. Include total start-up costs for the services and supplies outlined in the Scope of Work in RFP as well as monthly cost. The monthly cost should be based on testing operations that would run for one year, six days a week, 6 hours per day. This will be considered the "Base Cost Proposal – Part 1A."

Part 1B: Billing and anticipated billing reimbursements.
Provide a Billing cost structure and proposal that addresses the costs for services included in Scope of Work. Please identify your billing costs, whether you would propose an offset to the per COVID-19 test cost in Part 1A with the reimbursement to the Proposer or reimbursement directly back to the District, and your assumed rate of return (e.g., % of claims accepted within a certain amount of months).

For the purposes of preparing this proposal, Proposers should factor in that approximately 75% of staff surveillance tests administered are for patients with medical insurance and 50% of student surveillance tests are for patients with medical insurance. When considering claim acceptance rates, proposers should project that current federal and state regulations regarding COVID-19 testing remain in place for the duration of the contract.

Part 1A and Part 1B costs will be combined to develop one final cumulative total Total Cost Proposal."

The firm with the lowest pricing across Part 1A and Part 1B will receive all 15 points. Points will be assigned to all other proposals by dividing the lowest "Base Cost Proposal" (for Part 1A and Part 1B) by the other proposal(s) cost and multiplying by 15 points.

Oral Interviews (Optional)
As noted earlier, the District at its sole discretion may decide to conduct interviews as part of this RFP process. If the District decides to conduct oral interviews, the Proposers that met the Minimum Qualifications will be invited to attend the interview before the Evaluation Team. The interview will consist of an oral presentation by the proposer followed by questions and answers. The maximum points possible for the oral interview is 100.

Final Score and Ranking
At the conclusion of the interview (if held), the points awarded for interviews will be combined with the points awarded at the Proposal Evaluation phase to reach a final score for each Proposer. The scores are then ranked from the highest to the lowest.

Reference Checks
Reference checks, including but not limited to prior clients as indicated in SOW Narrative– Prior Project References, may be used to determine the applicability of Proposer experience to the services the District is requesting, the quality of services and staffing provided to prior clients, adherence to schedules/budgets and Proposer's problem-solving, project management and communication abilities, performance on deliverables and outcomes, and effectiveness in meeting or exceeding project objectives. If reference checks deem that information included in a Prior Project References or elsewhere in the Proposal is untruthful, then the District will reject the Proposal.

Release and Waiver Agreement
To effectuate the candid completion of the reference check above, Proposer is required to sign the RFP Attachment I, Section 14, Release of Liability.

### 5.4 Other Terms and Conditions
The selection of any prequalified Proposer for contract negotiations shall not imply acceptance by the District of all terms of the Proposal, which may be subject to further negotiation and approvals before the District may be legally bound thereby.

The District will select the most qualified and responsive Proposer with whom District staff will commence contract negotiations. If a satisfactory contract cannot be negotiated in a reasonable time with the selected Proposer, then the District, in its sole discretion, may terminate negotiations and begin contract negotiations with the next highest scoring Proposer it deems qualified.

The District, in its sole discretion, has the right to approve or disapprove any staff person assigned to a firm's projects before and throughout the contract term. The District reserves the right at any time to approve, disapprove or modify proposed project plans, timelines and deliverables. Such approvals will not be unreasonably withheld.

## 6. Protest Procedures

Email: UdomA@sfusd.edu

### 6.5 Protest Review
The District's Purchasing Department will confirm receipt of notice of protest by Proposer which must be submitted in accordance to Section 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, and 6.4.

If a Proposer submits a complete and timely protest, the Purchasing Department will review notice of protest soon after receipt of the protest to determine validity of notice, including but not limited to: i) receipt by due date; ii) inclusion of a written statement specifying in detail each and every one of the grounds asserted for the protest; iii) signed by an individual authorized to represent the Proposer; iv) citation of the law, rule, local ordinance, procedure, or RFP provision on which the protest is based; and v) specification of facts and evidence sufficient for the District to determine the validity of the protest.

A Proposer may not rely on a Protest submitted by another Proposer but must timely pursue its own Protest.

The District, at its discretion, may make a determination regarding a protest without requesting further documents or information from the Proposer who submitted the protest. Accordingly, the initial protest must include all grounds of protest and all supporting documentation or evidence reasonably available to the prospective Proposer at the time the protest is submitted. If the Proposer later raises new grounds or evidence that were not included in the initial protest, but which could have been raised at that time, then the District may not consider such new grounds or new evidence.

If the notice of protest is determined to be valid, the Purchasing Department shall review facts and evidence to determine the outcome of the protest, citing any applicable laws, rules, ordinances, procedures, and/or provisions. The review shall be an informal process conducted by the Purchasing Department or its designee, and will be based upon the information submitted by the Proposer in its protest letter. The Purchasing Department may seek input from the District's Legal Office, and/or other District departments as needed or appropriate. The Controller's Office will notify the Proposer in writing of its decision at the conclusion of the review. The Purchasing Department or its designee shall make the final determination regarding the outcome of the protest. The decision of the Purchasing Department is final.
