summary_short: The “Testing Programs and Playbooks” index is a curated compilation of links and brief notes on COVID-19 testing strategies, school surveillance programs, pooled-testing pilots, lab partners, and related guidance (national and state). It’s useful for quickly finding comparable playbooks, vendor/program examples, and operational references when designing or evaluating a testing program.

Looks like they are planning this as a sample collection program far beyond their own NGS test
"Scalable: Existing labs running individual molecular tests (i.e. PCR) can also run pooled samples. This means pooling could multiply our existing testing capacity by twenty times or more"

Starting tomorrow, thru Jan 6th all @SalemSchoolsk12 students + family members living in the same household are able to participate in FREE COVID-19 testing. This testing is a saliva based model. A sample pic of the test kit is below - it’s super easy - just spit in the tube!

“WPS COVID-19 Pool Surveillance Testing”
*“DO YOUR PART: Help Schools Start & Stay in Person”*
Contracted with [Mirimus Saliva Clear website](https://www.salivaclear.com/)

Once a week, on a designated morning, each staff member and student picks up their barcoded SalivaClear sample collection kit from school. They register it via a Google Form, entering in their barcode number and their consent agreement. They then **self-collect** their saliva sample (guided by visual and video instruction materials), seal it, and immediately return it to the school staff.

The samples are then transported to a Mirimus clinical lab, where they are **pooled and tested the same day**. Any pools that test positive will be immediately retested at a pool level of 2 samples.

The school is notified of any pair of samples that contains a positive result, and the 2 people in that pair are directed to obtain a physician’s order for a diagnostic COVID test. The diagnostic tests may be performed by Mirimus (which uses the [MeentaSafe reporting platform](https://marketplace.meenta.io/)) or by another clinical lab.
