summary_short: San Francisco Unified School District’s February 11, 2021 Q&A addendum clarifies expectations for its RFP for end-to-end student and staff asymptomatic COVID-19 testing services. It confirms the selected vendor must deliver the full stack (data systems, call center, onsite operations, hardware/Wi-Fi, and an identified certified lab partner) and operate testing Monday–Saturday, with multilingual interpretation available via a language vendor. The responses also address testing methodology (PCR required for screening unless antigen is twice-weekly), note BinaxNOW availability subject to inventory, and reiterate that SFUSD will not split scope across multiple contracts or deviate from the stated evaluation criteria.

# San Francisco Unified School District
## RFP for End-to-End Covid-19 Student and Staff Asymptomatic Testing Services
### Reply to Questions Received Through February 8, 2021 at 5:00 P.M. (PST)

**Date:** February 11, 2021  
**To:** All Prospective Respondents  
**From:** Albie Udom, Director of Procurement

This notice responds to the questions received by the San Francisco Unified School District regarding the RFP for End-to-End Covid-19 Student and Staff Asymptomatic Testing Services.

---

**Question 1:** Are we expected to provide everything from database, to laboratory subcontracting etc.
**Answer 1:** Yes, the winning proposer would be expected to provide everything from database, to laboratory subcontracting etc.

---

**Question 2:** Lab testing is there a specific lab the tests are being sent to?
**Answer 2:** If this is related to the tests that are completed at the test sites, the answer is that the vendor is to identify the lab that they are sending the tests to for analysis.

---

**Question 3:** 6 days per week, Is it Mondays-Saturdays?
**Answer 3:** The winning proposer would be expected to provide testing six days a week from Monday to Saturday.

---

**Question 4:** How would the Proposer secure, make accessible and/or integrate data across the Scope of Work areas? What standards and APIs does the Proposer employ? (are they expecting us to have a database system or are we logging on to something that has already been created for the project?)
**Answer 4:** There is not a single data management system but rather multiple data systems that the Proposer will need to integrate with. The proposer will need to develop the APIs, or leverage existing APIs, to support the integration of data across the Scope of Work areas. System integrations include:
- Smartsheets for tracking and monitoring contact tracing. Smartsheets provides a data uploader that the Proposer will need to integrate with.
- CA state surveillance system in compliance with its requirements
- SFDPH

---

**Question 5:** Will the Proposer and all proposed subcontractors lab(s) be CLIA-certified by the proposal due date? (is this just for the lab, do we need to have a lab partnership prior to the proposal or are labs applying as well)
**Answer 5:** The request is for end-to-end testing services which includes a partnership with an identified laboratory. It is preferred that the proposer has identified a lab that already has the required certifications (CLIA, CMS, CDPH).

---

**Question 6:** Registration /staffing onsite management: Language translation into Arabic, Chinese, Samoan, Spanish, Tagalog, and Vietnamese (is this in the database system or do we have to have the interpreters at the site or through a language vendor)
**Answer 6:** This can be achieved through a language vendor. The contractor may not need all those languages available at the testing sites but must be able to connect with an interpreter as needed either by telephone or in person.

---

**Question 7:** Staffing or call center 7 days a week (8-5) including holidays- (is this staffed by us or does the city have this vendor)
**Answer 7:** The request is for end-to-end testing services. The winning proposer would have to provide and staff a call center.

---

**Question 8:** Will the vendor need to supply tablets/laptop stations and Wi-Fi to support onsite registration as needed?
**Answer 8:** Yes. SFUSD will not provide technology hardware or support for the testing at sites. By providing its own hardware and WiFi, the contractor can guarantee that their platform is compatible with the required technology and provide the necessary support.

---

**Question 9:** Would SFUSD be open to awarding contracts for "Staffing Only" proposals that would meet the staffing needs of this RFP but not the lab-specific requirements?
**Answer 9:** The request is for end-to-end testing services from one firm with or without subcontractors. SFUSD will award only one contract for the services. SFUSD does not intend to award different contracts for different parts of the scope of work.

---

**Question 10:** Asymptomatic COVID-19 screening via PCR presents several issues: turnaround time means infected individuals continue to spread while awaiting results, and an individual's PCR result may remain positive long after the individual is no longer infectious. Will rapid antigen surveillance testing be given preference over PCR in order to avoid these issues?
**Answer 10:** Antigen testing will not be preferred over PCR as this is an FDA off-label use of antigen tests. For asymptomatic screening testing, the test must be PCR or it can be antigen testing if it is done on a twice weekly cadence. The lower sensitivity of antigen testing is mitigated by frequent testing (i.e., to not miss the early period of infectiousness). The proposer may indicate the testing algorithms they intend to use (e.g., confirmation of antigen with PCR, cadence, using the Ct values,) the reviewers can evaluate.

---

**Question 11:** What is SFUSD's plan for staff and teachers presenting cold or flu-like symptoms in order to rule out COVID-19 infection? Lost time for symptomatic teachers, staff and students is an issue already faced by opened schools. It typically takes 2-4 days for a PCR test to confirm a COVID-19 negative result which could mean the loss of a week of in person school.
**Answer 11:** Please refer to information in the RFP regarding Asymptomatic Testing.

---

**Question 12:** In the case of staffing shortage due to quarantine or illness of teachers or staff, what is SFUSD's plan for rapidly clearing substitutes to safely enter school buildings?
**Answer 12:** Please refer to the information in the RFP regarding Asymptomatic Testing.

---

**Question 13:** Will SFDPH distribute BinaxNOW rapid tests to schools? These tests have proven highly effective in community testing programs here in San Francisco.
**Answer 13:** Yes, subject to inventory levels and compliance with requirements.

---

**Question 14:** Can you provide a specific breakdown of testing numbers and roll out timing for (a) teachers/staff, (b) middle school, (c) high school, (d) elementary school, (e) special education and/or non-age specific groups?
**Answer 14:** Please use the information in the RFP which reflects the information we have currently.

---

**Question 15:** What is the district's budget for the initial term of the contract (first 12 months)?
**Answer 15:** This District will not provide this information at this time because it does not consider this information essential for a proposer to submit their proposal.

---

**Question 16:** We would be proposing a solution that would fulfill the intent of this RFP and not impact surrounding neighborhoods and district property, however, we would be unable to answer 'Yes' to all of the initial evaluation criteria. The instructions clearly state that if we answer 'no' to any of the evaluation criteria, we will be automatically disqualified. How should we go about submitting an alternative proposal?
**Answer 16:** The District will not deviate from the evaluation criteria stated in the RFP.
